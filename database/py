"*" matches anything, ".example.com" matches example.com and all subdomains
"/' Used when a value is quoted.
"Alter" the field's blankness.
"Convert" the plist so that any weird whitespace changes from the preprocessor do not affect the XML parser in mac_tool.
"FirstPublished" contains the date for original airing.
"Gaussian blur" is supported in both, but the lightnening effect only in the inkscape.
"Model.field" Check clashes between accessor or reverse query name of `field` and any other field name -- i.e. accessor for Model.foreign is model_set and it clashes with Target.model_set.
"Narrow" Python builds don't support unicode code points outside BMP.
"Qualified" means the file that a target was defined in and the target name, separated by a colon, suffixed by a # and the toolset name: /path/to/file.gyp:target_name#toolset
"all" is a concatenation of the "all" targets from all the included sub-makefiles.
"apm test" exits with an error when there is no "spec" directory
"auto_id" tells the Form to add an "id" attribute to each form element.
"copy" is deprecated in favor of "remote_src".
"crash.swift" gives an exit code other than 1.
"feature" and "nightly-news" pages use theplatform.com
"git add" the result.
"gyp_all_modules" is a concatenation of the "gyp_all_modules" targets from all the included sub-makefiles.
"implementation" for Solaris 9.
"include" is specified relative to subdict_path, so compute the real path to include by appending the provided "include" to the directory in which subdict_path resides.
"include" should use the new style "foo/bar.h" instead of just "bar.h"
"isa" isn't in the _properties dictionary, it's an intrinsic property of the class which the object belongs to.
"iv" from _gen_key_initctr
"key" is a reserved word in MySQL, so use "cache_key" instead.
"ls" sometimes prints on stderr
"marker" is not a Polygon property, and should be ignored.
"noqa" is used to suppress this warning.
"raw" and "include" directives are disabled
"shape" : tuple of int "fortran_order" : bool "descr" : dtype.descr
"simple" mode is when the range falls entirely within (-t, t) -- it should just display (vmin, 0, vmax)
"string" rather than "S10"), but we want to return the specific type for datetime64 (ie.
"unwrap" the widget wrapper, if needed

' + ' '.join(comment_notes)

'#' characters must be escaped even embedded in a string, else Make will treat it as the start of a comment.
')' will be handled by the parentheses group
',' is also official (less common): NOM-008-SCFI-2002
'-' for DESC columns should be accounted for in the index name.
'--list' this is last to make it default
'.' is like 'O', but calls a method of the object instead of a function
'./www.google.com/index.html'
'/' is notably absent from this list, because there's no way for a regular expression to be treated as a path.
'1' no longer in the cache.
'::' should be encompassed by start, digits or end.
'Dydd Llun' The *_INPUT_FORMATS strings use the Python strftime format syntax, see http://docs.python.org/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior
'ENDDATE': 'For legal reasons, this video was only available for a specified period of time.',
'Empty' Blender objects do not use obj.data.items() for custom properties, using obj.keys()
'Generic' will try to map to platform.system() that we are not mocking here
'Geometry' initialization implies an unknown geometry type.
'Julia' with accented 'u':
'K' doesn't reverse the axes of negative strides
'Mor' is not a valid month
'PREMIUM': 'PREMIUM',
'True' or 'true' should be rendered without a value attribute
'_meta.related_field' also contains M2M reverse fields, these will be filtered out
'adapted from http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/ Recipe/189744'

'auto' doesn't split up the date
'bar_unit_demo.py', # broken, fixme 'ellipse_with_units.py',  # broken, fixme
'bytes' is also safe, as is 'ASCII'.
'c', complex, corresponding real dtype
'cmake -E copy src dst' will create the 'dst' directory if needed.
'col' is of the form 'field' or 'field1__field2' or '-field1__field2__field', etc.
'contentv4' is used in the website, but it also returns the related videos, we don't need them
'created', non-editable, is excluded by default
'data_abstract' is a forward field, and therefore will be found
'data_abstract' is a reverse field, and will raise an exception
'default' again With a router that doesn't prohibit migrating 'other', consistency is checked.
'default' and 'other' With a router that doesn't allow migrating on any database, no consistency checks are made.
'default' is checked Router says not to migrate 'other' so consistency shouldn't be checked.
'django.contrib.admin'.
'django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.DefaultStorageFinder',
'download' link redirects to the original webpage
'dst' must be an array
'figure_align': 'htbp',
'find' returns the top of these four bytes, so we'll need to munch them later to prevent them from polluting the payload.
'func' keyword, which must be followed by at least one space
'id' in list_display_links
'id' not in list_display_links
'isolation_level' is a misleading API.
'ja' uses this config value.
'k' is Fortran ordered, and 'm' should have the same ordering as 'k' and NOT become C ordered
'line': above patches, below lines
'mac_framework_dirs', input already handles _dirs endings.
'managed' is True by default.
'obj' can be a class or a function.
'parse_interface_line' and 'parse_inet*_line' leave two dicts in the ipv4/ipv6 lists which is ugly and hard to read.
'parse_interface_line()' checks for previously seen interfaces before defining 'current_if' so that IPv6 facts don't clobber IPv4 facts (or vice versa).
'paywall': 'paywall',
'pk' is included for backwards compatibility
'pointsize': '10pt', Additional stuff for the LaTeX preamble.
'preamble': '', Latex figure (float) alignment
'preamble': '', Latex figure (float) alignment 'figure_align': 'htbp',
'recommended' feed has infinite 'load more' and each new portion spins the same videos in (sometimes) slightly different order, so we'll check for unicity and break when portion has no new videos
'shutdown_message' is a stealth option.
'skip': 'Extremely unreliable',
'src' is a dictionary
'standard' validates to None.
'string':'NPY_STRING'
'table_name_filter' is a stealth option
'target_build_files' keeps track of the keys corresponding to "target" files.
'today' special value
'touch'/create an empty file
'truncatingBitPattern' initializer is defined if the conversion is truncating on any platform that Swift supports.
'units_scatter.py', # broken, fixme
'url' results don't have a title
'video exists but is marked as "deleted" md5 is unstable
'writemasked' and 'arraymask' may not be used together
'zh' user can custom change `jieba` dictionary path.
(0, 0) is manually added at this stage,  so there will be no duplicate points in the (x, y) plane.
(0,0) is lower left, (1,1) is upper right of axes
(0,0) is lower left, (1,1) is upper right of figure
(1) the file output should mention the proper .o file.
(A UTF-8-based locale which is thoroughly different from "C" would flush out more bugs, but we have no way of knowing if such a locale exists.)
(All of these functions use assert_array_compare under the hood.) None of these should raise.
(Also in the printed Python Cookbook.)
(Can't use django.db.connection because it'll modify the default connection itself.)
(Colorbar needs this even for line contours.)
(Creating a Triangulation without specifying the triangles results in the Delaunay triangulation of the points.)
(During loading, reordering of triangulation._triangles may occur so that all final triangles are now anti-clockwise)
(First we need to know which order the keys fall in "naturally" on your system, so we can put things in the wrong way around from normal.
(For instance, setting the UNIX socket file to be readable and writable by a specific UNIX group and then putting users into that group).
(For the systems where this happens, temporary files will be auto-deleted on close anyway.)
(GenericRelation was previously a fake m2m field).
(Ideally we might even make this work properly, but since that will require rewriting a bunch of how ufuncs work then we are not counting on that.)
(If the array has the wrong kind or shape, raise the error during one-at-a-time conversion.)
(If we're expecting a prompt but the escalation succeeds, we didn't need the password and can carry on regardless.)

(Type 3 fonts can not have a CIDMap).
(Unittest's default is to set top-level equal to the path, which means relative imports will result in "Attempted relative import in non-package.").
(We use something that will fit into a latin1 database encoding here, because that is still the default used on many system setups.)

After we've computed the stats, we can go through and change anything.
Afterwards, we can accumulate output without looking at it.
Again, if verbose.level is helpful, a message is given in the terminal window.
Again, it must be mentioned to ensure that only "must include" fields are pulled in.
Again, make sure that all labels are large enough to be easily read by the viewer.

Although test runner calls migrate for several databases, testing for only one of them is quite sufficient.
Although the function definitions take `const unsigned char *` as their parameter, we use c_char_p here so the function may take Python strings directly as parameters.

As I think it is best to change the backend to support file-like object, i'm going to leave it as it is.
As InspectdbPeople model is defined after InspectdbMessage, it should be quoted
As ``limit_choices_to`` can be a callable, invoke it here.
As a bonus we also get facts on non-amd64/i386 platforms this way.
As a consequence, we must skip tests that don't enforce a specific timezone (with timezone.override or equivalent), or attempt to interpret naive datetimes in the default timezone.
As a matter of fact, The information from the _get_textbox function should be available during the Text._get_layout() call, which is called within the _get_textbox.
As a result, link_directories must come before the target definition.
As a sanity check, just test that get_include includes something reasonable.
As a special case, dimension 0 of 1-dimensional arrays is "horizontal"
As a workaround, manually expand variables at gyp time.
As cursor.description does not return reliably the nullable property, we have to query the information_schema (#7783)

As simple dtype w/o names (but multiple fields)
As soon as we put wsave back into the cache, another thread could pick it up and start using it, so we must not do this until after we're completely done using it ourselves.

As string w/ names (too many)
As string w/o names but different default format
As such, any options that don't match a valid keyword argument are removed and set under the `behaviors` key instead, to maintain backwards compatibility.
As the assertQuerysetEqual uses a set for comparison, check we've only got David listed once
As the field is disabled, the value should not be affected by the form data.
As the last position we just take the maximally possible position.
As the last resort, show the login form
As the needed functions cannot be determined by static inspection of the code, it is safest to use import * pending a major refactoring of f2py.
As there may be more than one handler with the notified name as the parent, so we just keep track of whether or not we found one at all
As we've passed through this model, but not explicitly included any fields, we have to make sure it's mentioned so that only the "must include" fields are pulled in.
As with CharField, this will cause URL validation to be performed twice.
As with CharField, this will cause email validation to be performed twice.
As with any widget that implements get_value_from_datadict(), we must accept the input from the "as_hidden" rendering as well.

Because 0001 and 0002 are both applied, even though this migrate run didn't apply anything new, their squashed replacement should be marked as applied.
Because Xcode's rule engine is not being used, they need to be expanded as they are written to the makefile.
Because a cache can fail silently (e.g. memcache), we don't know if we are failing to create a new session because of a key collision or because the cache is missing.
Because a particular *instance* of the class might want to alter self.fields, we create self.fields here by copying base_fields.
Because clib are generated before extensions, we have to explicitly add an extension which has generate_config_h and generate_numpyconfig_h as sources *before* adding npymath.
Because close can be called during shutdown we need to cache os.unlink and access it as self.unlink only
Because disabling constraint checks can be expensive on some database (especially MSSQL), bail out early if no fixtures are found.
Because floating-point arithmetic isn't exact, we set a tolerance to pass into GEOS `equals_exact`.
Because it happens to have the same fields as the Category model, we can just call the form's save() to apply its changes to an existing Category instance.
Because it's a parent link, all the data is available in the instance, so populate the parent model with this data.
Because most image and raster GIS data has the first row in the array as the "top" of the image, dy is implicitly negative.
Because no Articles exist yet, earliest() raises ArticleDoesNotExist.
Because no Articles exist yet, latest() raises ArticleDoesNotExist.
Because of that wo can't make use of the get_list method in the AWSQueryConnection.
Because of the DST change, 2 days and 6 hours after the chosen date in naive arithmetic is only 2 days and 5 hours after in aware arithmetic.
Because only whitespaces are allowed before the keywords, this will also ignore most do-while-loops, since those lines should start with closing brace.
Because place is the primary key on Restaurant, the save will create a new restaurant
Because pointers have been set to NULL, an exception should be raised when we try to access it.
Because settings are imported lazily, we need to explicitly load them.
Because the ForeignKey cannot be null, existing members of the set must remain.
Because the TQM may survive multiple play runs, we start by marking any hosts as failed in the iterator here which may have been marked as failed in previous runs.
Because the result of force_escape is "safe", an additional escape filter has no effect (to be changed in Django 2.0).
Because the underlying routines preserve the NaN bits, every value is preserved when converting to/from other floats.
Because this is a middleware, we can't assume the errors will be caught elsewhere.
Because this is an async task, the action handler is async.
Because this is initialized, _render_cursor can assume that cursor exists.
Because this module imports nose directly, it should not be used except by nosetester.py to avoid a general NumPy dependency on nose.
Because this parser has no nesting state about templates, by the time it saw "class Comparator", it may think that it's a new class.
Because we have messed with __class__ below, we confuse pickle as to what class we are pickling.
Because we haven't made any remote connection we're running as the local user, rather than as whatever is configured in remote_user.
Because we only want the key to be a string.
Because we use select_related() for 'boss', it doesn't need to be prefetched, but we can still traverse it although it contains some nulls
Because we violated the semantics, all the values became 1
Because we violated the semantics, all the values became 2.5
Because we want to test creation and deletion of these as separate things, these models are all inserted into a separate Apps so the main test runner doesn't migrate them.
Because we've now applied 0001 and 0002 both, their squashed replacement should be marked as applied.
Because xerr and yerr will be passed to errorbar, most dimension checking and processing will be left to the errorbar method.

Both 'countries' only have two geometries.
Both InterfaceError and ProgrammingError seem to be used when accessing closed cursor (psycopg2 has InterfaceError, rest seem to use ProgrammingError).
Both Login objs should have same description so that only the one having smaller PK will be deleted.
Both assigment of the sys.path and changing/adding parts of the sys.path are the same: They get added to the current sys.path.
Both can be increased if necessary.
Both for Animations and just timers.
Both messages are twice on page -- one rendered as html, one as plain text (for pastebin)
Both of those raise warnings, so the testcase class ignores them all.

Bump texture map_bump texture_bump.jpg or bump texture_bump.jpg
Bump up the version for upgrade.
Bundle all of the above together, if needed.
Bundle postbuilds can depend on the whole bundle, so run them after the bundle is packaged, not already after the bundle binary is done.
But "full_name_2" has, and it can be used to initialize the class.
But I don't know how to invoke Distutils in a safer way...
But I don't know what the best approach is now and this change to _to_int should at least prevent mpl from crashing on these JDH (2009-11-06)
But XCTarget is defined below, so it can't be put into the schema yet.

But don't run the check unless we have something to check.
But gunicorn is not in the sys.path.
But if a is readonly, it's fine
But if the new text contains any line breaks, we can create one
But if the user is getting a permission denied error it probably means that docker on their system is only configured to be connected to by root and they are not running as root.
But if we fill in data for one of the fields, the form is no longer empty and the whole thing must pass validation.
But if we kill the cache, we get a new object
But if we kill the cache, we get a new object.
But if we render the response, we can pickle it.
But if we wait a couple of seconds...
But if you compare a non-string array to a string array, or two arrays with non-identical structured dtypes, or anything like that, then internally stuff blows up.
But in UTC, the __date only matches one of them.
But in many cases, after trie compression there will be fewer than 256 unique second-level lookup tables and/or data storage blocks, which allows one to use 8-bit words in lookup tables.
But it can't be taken into account for checking if limit doesn't match any hosts.
But it seems like bit rot since this flag is specified in another place with the exact same value in build-script-impl.
But it should appear in get_fields()/fieldsets() so it can be displayed as read-only.
But it should still be possible to add new ordering after that.
But it shouldn't be deleted, even if there are no more objects using it.
But it shouldn't work if a FK references a model with the same app_label.
But it shouldn't work if some of bases belongs to the specified app.
But it's enough for our tests.
But it's still good enough for CheckSectionSpacing.
But not here, since obj3.__rmul__ is obj2.__rmul__.
But same function will be used with vertical packing.
But should work fine when transformed to projected coordinates
But since older bigip libraries don't give us a way to toggle verification we need to disable it at the global level.
But since we do not have that kind of information at this point, we just don't try to pad anything for the theta axis of a polar plot.
But some of the values are currently being used by other subclasses (for instance, os_family and distribution).
But that requires changing other things too (known thing to change would be PATHS_CACHE, PLUGIN_PATHS_CACHE, and MODULE_CACHE.
But the conditions need to be stronger then the scalar default if it is scalar.
But the first entry in the query's FROM clause must not be a JOIN.
But the limitation of the get_internal_type() / data_types approach is that it cannot handle database column types that aren't already mapped to one of the built-in Django field types.
But the naive approach would put the TOC file into the bundle, so don't do this for bundles for now.
But the same query issued explicitly at a database will work.
But the test is correct since the layout is manually edited
But the write goes through:
But then we would have to modify __array_finalize__ to prevent the mask of being reshaped if it hasn't been set up properly yet So it's easier to stick to the current version
But there was no way to tell before.
But this one also needs its own iterator...
But this should work with a smaller/equal mask to the reduction operand
But we also emit a DeprecationWarning, b/c eventually we should raise an error here.
But we aren't smart enough to remove the existing annotations from the query, so those would force us to use GROUP BY.
But we can access keys on the dict that's returned by ``__call__``, instead.
But we can get a view as an ndarray of the given type:
But we fake them when query logging is enabled to keep query counts consistent with other backends.
But we still only instantiate 3 forms
But we'll treat none+uncaught as no-op since that's all LLDB can do.
But you can get natural keys if you ask for them and they are available
But, as the join is nullable first use by annotate will be LOUTER
But, distutils will complain if the environment's value is different from the one in the Python Makefile used to build Python.
But, if common data types are requested, they are
But, this relation isn't direct, the join is generated reverse along foreign key.
But: I know no use case, where this could be practical and the jedi would return wrong types.
By adding toolbar in sizer, we are able to put it at the bottom of the frame - so appearance is closer to GTK version
By adding toolbar in sizer, we are able to put it at the bottom of the frame - so appearance is closer to GTK version.
By choosing offsets that match the appropriate axes limits, the projected contours will sit on the 'walls' of the graph
By convention, it's called "all".
By converting to floats now, we can avoid that on every draw.
By default OFTReals are mapped to `FloatField`, however, they may also be mapped to `DecimalField` if specified in the `decimal` keyword.
By default foreign object doesn't relate to any remote field (for example custom multicolumn joins currently have no remote field).
By default it's assumed that the client doesn't clean up connections properly, in which case the backend must do so after each request.
By default memcached allows objects up to 1MB.
By default related field will not have a column as it relates to columns from another table.
By default the fields come from ModelAdmin.list_editable, but if we pull the fields out of the form instead of list_editable custom admins can provide fields on a per request basis
By default, 'database'-tagged checks are not run as they do more than mere static code analysis.
By default, Django will use a "pretty" version of the form field name, if the Field is part of a Form.
By default, all are NULL in the table.
By default, all geometry types are allowed.
By default, an extra blank form is included.
By default, forms append a hyphen between the prefix and the field name, but a form can alter that behavior by implementing the add_prefix() method.
By default, it displays 1 blank form.
By default, it only gets you your Nuclide server processes.
By default, none of this is needed.
By default, on Darwin we support benchmarks on all non-simulator platforms.
By default, pylibmc/libmemcached don't verify keys client-side and so this test triggers a server-side bug that causes later tests to fail (#19914).
By default, sub classes may overwrite this behavior
By default, the get query will be directed to 'other'
By default, the lengths of the paths are justified.
By default, the ordering is different from the swapped version
By default, we don't support benchmarks on most platforms.
By default, we now merge in all vars from all roles in the play, unless the user has disabled this via a config option
By default, we should get an argument of 3 for both -Onone and -O
By default, you get raw keys on dumpdata
By design, these four functions don't perform any checks on their arguments.
By doing this we detach the socket from the CherryPy stack avoiding memory leaks
By ignoring refnames without digits, we filter out many common branch names like "release" and "stabilization", as well as "HEAD" and "master".
By inheriting from LazyObjectTestCase and redefining the lazy_wrap() method which all testcases use, we get to make sure all behaviors tested in the parent testcase also apply to SimpleLazyObject.
By obtaining, using, and/or copying this software and/or its associated documentation, you agree that you have read, understood, and will comply with the following terms and conditions:
By offsetting it slightly, we can force it to be (0, 0) to (1, 1), which both makes it only be a single pixel and places it correctly aligned to 1-width stroking (i.e. the ticks).
By picking up this special type and converting it to a dynamic library (com.apple.product-type.library.dynamic) with fix-ups, single-file loadable modules can be produced.
By preference, use the converters specified by the user
By providing a sample datetime instance with the desired timezone, the registered converter can be selected, and the "units" attribute, which is the timezone, can be set.
By removing ourselves from sys.modules here, before the child build happens, we protect the child from the parent's versioneer too.
By setting this a little bit higher, we can remove some "maximum recursion depth" errors.
By setting vmin and vmax in the norm, we establish the range to which the regular palette color scale is applied.
By the way this causes Crunchyroll to not work in georestriction cases in some browsers that don't place the locale lang first in header.
By using the cache, it is possible to avoid running get_format_modules repeatedly.
By using this, we are testing that the view processor is properly lazy and doesn't call get_token() until needed.
Bypass Django's wrappers and use the underlying sqlite3 connection to avoid logging this query - it would trigger infinite recursion.
Byte order change by requesting NBO
Byte order characters also control native vs.

Bytestrings are transformed to normal strings.
C can't deal with Unicode escapes in identifiers.
C doesn't grok regexes, and they aren't needed for gettext, so just output a string instead.
C doesn't have single-quoted strings, so make all strings double-quoted.
C is the colors array defined at either points or faces (i.e. triangles).

Change the following values to adapt to your project:
Change the font of Chars, but leave Kerns alone
Change the manager to not return "row matched" for update().
Change the name to aid debugging.
Change the ordering to the swapped version - this changes the ordering of the queryset.
Change the working directory to the directory of the example, so it can get at its data files, if any.
Change to a `ctypes.Union` in to accommodate in future when pre-1.4.6 versions are no longer distributed.
Change url doesn't exist -- don't display link to edit
Change user cannot perform "Save as new" (no 'add' permission).
Change values by changing the attributes, then calling save().
Change/delete perm on inner2s, so we can change/delete existing
Changed title for 1st article
Changes literals ('a', 1, 1.0, etc) to its type instances (str(), int(), float(), etc).
Changes the font name
Changing each ring in the polygon
Changing from a masked array to nan-filled ndarray is probably most efficient at this point.
Changing the angle of the arrow heads 6.
Changing the appearance of the patch and the labels after the figure is created
Changing the interior ring on the poly attribute.
Changing the line offsets is very important, because if they don't fit, all the start_pos values will be wrong.
Changing the offset between the tips of the paths and their labels 7.
Changing the path does not change the result (it's cached).
Changing the path should change the result (and cancel out the scaling from the transform).
Changing the transform should change the result.
Changing them back to empty should also make a change
Changing this will break server upgrade, as we rely on it to find existing servers.
Channel name may be typed if different case than the original channel name (e.g. http://www.twitch.tv/TWITCHPLAYSPOKEMON) that will lead to constructing an invalid m3u8 URL.

E.g. "foo/bar" when we're constructing targets for "foo/bar/baz.gyp".
E.g. 'type foo string' will make foo a plain struct in the eyes of gdb, circumventing the pretty print triggering.

Exception used in shares_memory()
Exceptions are not equal to equivalent instances of themselves, so can't just use assertEqual(original, unpickled)
Exceptions are special - they've got state that isn't in self.__dict__.
Exclude abstract models that are not included in the Apps registry and have no cache.

Exclude excluded sources coming into the generator.
Exclude excluded sources from being built.
Exclude fields that aren't on the form.

Exclude rightmost interval in y.
Exclude the current object from the query if we are editing an instance (as opposed to creating a new one)
Exclude the current object from the query if we are editing an instance (as opposed to creating a new one) Note that we need to use the pk as defined by model_class, not self.pk.
Excluded files can also go into the project file.
Excluded variable support
Excluding a bogus app should throw an error
Excluding a bogus model should throw an error
Excluding a related item works as you would expect, too (although the SQL involved is a little complex).
Excluding across a m2m relation when there is more than one related object associated was problematic.
Excluding fixtures and fixtures.Article/Book should be a no-op
Excluding fixtures app should only leave sites
Excluding fixtures.Article/Book should leave fixtures.Category
Excluding from a relation that cannot be NULL should not use outer joins.
Excluding shouldn't eliminate NULL entries.
Excluding sites and fixtures.Article/Book should only leave fixtures.Category
Excluding the previous result returns everything.

FieldFile needs access to its associated model field and an instance it's attached to in order to work properly, but the only necessary data to be pickled is the file's name itself.
Fields #####################################################################
Fields are sometimes used without attaching them to models (for example in aggregation).
Fields can individually be required or optional.
Fields from columns whose names are Python keywords.
Fields on related models are stored in the literal double-underscore format, so that we can use a set datastructure.
Fields that are foreignkeys/m2ms depend on stuff
Fields that contain one-to-many relations with a generic model (like a GenericForeignKey) cannot generate reverse relations and therefore cannot be used for reverse querying.
Fields that weren't deleted aren't reloaded.
Fields whose names normalize to the same Python field name and hence are given an integer suffix.
Fields with choices get special treatment.
Fields with database column types of `varchar` and `text` need a second index that specifies their operator class, which is needed when performing correct LIKE queries outside the C locale.
Fifty lines of random 3-D lines
Figure ous ssh IP and Port
Figure out all the projects that will be generated and their guids
Figure out label rotation.
Figure out the pathname that this project needs to use to refer to the other one.
Figure out the underlying type of the enum to know if it is a signed or unsigned quantity.
Figure out what the contents of the variable parens are.
Figure out what the path really is
Figure out whether the path has a fill
Figure width in pixels
File class to use for file instances.
File coding may be specified.
File downloaded with and without credentials are different, so omit the md5 field
File extension may by .py, .pyc, etc.
File locking is not supported.
File names longer than 255 characters can cause problems on older OSes.
File objects can be assigned to FileField attributes, but shouldn't get committed until the model it's attached to is saved.
File representing the completion of actions/rules/copies, if any.
File representing whether any input dependencies necessary for dependent actions have completed.
File representing whether any input dependencies necessary for dependent compiles have completed.
File size part may be missing
File-like and iterator interface.
FileFields are a special case because they take their data from the request.FILES, not request.POST.
FileInput doesn't have a read method, we can't call json.load
FileModel with unicode filename and data #########################
FileSystemFinder searched locations
FileSystemStorage fallbacks to MEDIA_ROOT when location is empty, so we restore the empty value.
Files can be read in a little at a time, if necessary.
Files can be written to.
Files that aren't added to a sources or frameworks build phase can still go into the project file, just not as part of a build phase.
Files that have no dependencies are treated as dependent on root_node.
Filesystem path to the application directory eg.
Fill in missing information for column and row labels
Fill in the various *Name properties
Fill the apps cached property

Filter through different lookup.
Filter through related model with band index transform
Filter through related model.
Filter values is a list (if you put multiple values for the same tag name)
Filter with band index transform.
Filtered variables should reject access of attributes beginning with underscores.
Filtering and deleting works
Filters against the parent model return objects of the parent's type.
Filters and updates in one query.
Filters are allowed if explicitly included in list_filter
Filters must never raise exceptions, and pytz' exceptions inherit Exception directly, not a specific subclass.
Filters out m2m objects from reverse relations.
Filters should be allowed if they are defined on a ForeignKey pointing to this model
Filters should be allowed if they involve a local field without the need to whitelist them in list_filter or date_hierarchy.
Final loss (horizontal)
Finalize the extension modules so they can get the Numpy include dirs
Finalize the fill_value for structured arrays
Finalize1 is responsible for sorting duty, and once all project files are sorted, Finalize2 can come in and update these references.
Finalize2 needs to happen in a separate step because the process of updating references to other projects depends on the ordering of targets within remote project files.
Finally do cleanup - get rid of the joins we created above.
Finally link the file
Finally start copying
Finally store the processed paths
Finally test that filtering works.
Finally the value can of course be just plain Python value.

Finally, add a basic legend
Finally, add all top-level groups as children of 'all'.
Finally, add the importer to the meta path import hook.

Finally, save the figure as a PNG.
Finally, setting the extra selection attribute with the format string expanded with the stored procedure arguments.
Finally, the .so extension is forcibly applied over the default (.dylib), unless another forced extension is already selected.
Finally, the widget should have the 'radiolist' attr, and 'inline' as well if the field is specified HORIZONTAL.
Finally, we add any caller-supplied extras.
Finally, we apply the remaining lookup parameters from the query string (i.e. those that haven't already been processed by the filters).
Finally, we must return the newly created object:
Finally, we use the prett xml function to print the vcproj back to the user.
Finally, wrap the whole thing in quotes so that the above quote rule applies and whitespace isn't a word break.

For detailed comments on animation and the techniques used here, see the wiki entry http://www.scipy.org/wikis/topical_software/MatplotlibAnimation
For documentation purposes, this is why the datetime is dubious.
For doing the join in Python, we have to match both the FK val and the content type, so we use a callable that returns a (fk, class) pair.
For each app, print its migrations in order from oldest (roots) to newest (leaves).
For each dependencies in this project
For each line style, add a text annotation with a small offset from the reference point (0 in Axes coords, y tick value in Data coords).

For example another WhereNode
For example qs.iterator() could be passed as qs, but it does not have 'ordered' attribute.
For example, 'server_hostname' becomes '--system.hostname'.
For example, ``gca().set_yscale("mercator")`` would be used to select this scale.
For example, a Point column would be converted to MultiPoint.
For example, a database column can be specified by up to 4 levels: database.schema.table.column

For example, gnu would suggest gnu95 compiler type when there are F90 sources.
For example, here are a series of host definitions in a group:
For example, if a field is eligible to use the BooleanFieldListFilter, that'd be much more appropriate, and the AllValuesFieldListFilter won't get used for it.
For example, if a method call is suggested, this chunk will be equal to the method return type.
For example, if someone passes in a datetime object, we do not know automagically how to set the default min/max of the data and view limits.
For example, if you filter on employee__department__id, then the id value would be found already from employee__department_id.
For example, proxied ungettext calls require a count parameter and are converted to an empty string if they are missing it.
For example, the opts would be Author's (from the author field) and value.model would be Author.objects.all() queryset's .model (Author also).
For example, this allows unused code to appear as a warning instead of an error.
For example, this gets the primary key value of object "obj":
For example, to dump the API for all frameworks across macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS, in Swift 4, use:

For h264, the default format is yuv444p, which is not compatible with quicktime (and others).
For if/for/while/switch, the left and right parens should be consistent about how many spaces are inside the parens, and there should either be zero or one spaces inside the parens.
For implicit M2M tables, delete the auto-created table
For include(...) processing.
For inventory-wide caching
For join promotion this case is doing an AND for the added q_object and existing conditions.
For large querysets, the instantiation of all GDALRasters can potentially be expensive.
For legacy reasons, the fields property should only contain forward fields that are not private or with a m2m cardinality.

For most actions, add 'call' so that actions that invoke batch files return and continue executing.
For most of the GUI backends this adds an event to the queue of the GUI frameworks event loop.
For multicolumn lookups we need to build a multicolumn where clause.

For nested comprehensions we need to search the last one.
For non-autocreated 'through' models, can't assume we are dealing with PK values.
For non-field values, the value is either a method, property or returned via a callable.
For non-normed data, set the min to log base, again so that there is 1 full tick-label unit for the lowest bin
For non-proxy models, the variable is always None.
For non-raw_id fields, wrap the widget with a wrapper that adds extra HTML -- the "add other" interface -- to the end of the rendered output.

For not defined imports (goto doesn't find something, we take the name as a definition.
For now assume non HTTP(S) URLs always valid

For possible shortcuts see django.core.mail.
For preserving the number of input newlines in the output (used later in this method)
For pro videos or player.vimeo.com urls We try to find out to which variable is assigned the config dic
For purposes of seeing whether something has changed, None is the same as an empty string, if the data or initial value we get is None, replace it with ''.
For quoting column values, rather than columns.
For raster fields, assure input is None or a string, dict, or raster instance.
For raster fields, wrap index creation SQL statement with ST_ConvexHull.
For rasters, add explicit type cast to WKB string.
For real option handling, use optparse or getopt.
For real x, ignore the negative frequencies unless told otherwise
For reasons I don't quite understand, without a __module__ the created class appears to "live" in the wrong place, which causes issues later on.
For reasons of convention, the Android build system requires that all shared library modules are named 'libfoo' when generating -l flags.
For regular reports, it's nice to show them in reverse chronological order
For relational fields, use the output_field of the 'field' attribute.
For relative includes, just resolve the absolute path using the source path.
For replacement migrations, record individual statuses
For retrieving records by name or address.
For retrieving the envelope of the geometry.
For routines that return a string.
For security, these should not be executed.
For singly related objects, we have to avoid getting the attribute from the object, as this will trigger the query.
For some akamai manifests we'll need to add a query to the fragment url
For some commands, an additional line is needed to set the color map
For some distros and python versions we pick up this script in the temporary directory.
For some reason SpatiaLite does something screwy with the Texas geometry here.
For some reason this was thought to be malformed.
For some versions of gs, above steps result in an ps file where the original bbox is no more correct.
For some videos actual video id (prid) is different (e.g. for http://www.omroepwnl.nl/video/fragment/vandaag-de-dag-verkiezingen__POMS_WNL_853698 video id is POMS_WNL_853698 but prid is POW_00996502)

For testing HEX(EWKB).
For testing field and non-field errors
For testing method_decorator, a decorator that assumes a single argument.
For testing method_decorator, two decorators that add an attribute to the function
For testing non-form errors
For testing purposes: It is important that the number of parsers used can be minimized.
For testing the codes to add parameters
For that use `matplotlib.style.use('classic')`.
For the OR case, if all children voted for a join to be inner, then we can use INNER for the join.
For the cache_db session backend to always use the current session, memcached needs to delete the old key if it fails to set.
For the extend_max case we don't need to worry about passing more colors than ncolors as ListedColormap will clip.
For the most part, we assume that platform.dist() will tell the truth.
For the next half, try different modes.
For the purposes of this example, the 'Nearest_vs_none-pdf.pdf' has been pre-converted into 'Nearest_vs_none-pdf.png' at 80 dpi.
For the purposes of this regression test, it's important that there is no Join object related to the LeafA we create.
For the remainder of this test, create a copy of 'mark' in the 'default' database to prevent integrity errors on backends that don't defer constraints checks until the end of the transaction
For the remainder, let exceptions propagate.
For the rest, work with both comments and strings removed.
For the rightmost bin, we want values equal to the right edge to be counted in the last bin, and not as an outlier.
For the stdlib we always want values.
For the units authority, have to use the pipe symbole.
For this we need to check what came before the "(type)" string.
For those candidates which remain, determine how far they lie away from the line.

For toggle tools init the radio_group in self._toggled
For two string arrays, strings always raised the broadcasting error:
For unknown reasons, sometimes the list returned by __path__ contains duplicates that must be removed (#25246).
For urls like http://m.tvpot.daum.net/v/65139429, where the video_id is really a clipid
For user convenience, the names from _image are also imported into the image namespace:
For values set to None explicitly, return None instead as that allows a user to unset a parameter
For videos with large amounts of comments, most won't be retrieved.
For zeros at the beginning of the address.
For zeros at the end of the address.
Forbid URLs like http:///example.com - with a scheme, but without a hostname.

Foreign Keys being used to represent inline relationships are excluded from basic field value validation.
Foreign key constraints
Foreign keys pointing to this model, both from m2m and other models.
ForeignKey can become updated with the value of another ForeignKey.
ForeignKey is a special case since the field will actually be a descriptor that returns the other object
ForeignKey or ManyToManyFields
ForeignKey to BasePerson
ForeignKey to ProxyPerson
ForeignKey widgets in the admin are wrapped with RelatedFieldWidgetWrapper so they need to be handled properly when type checking.
ForeignKey's use another mapping dictionary for the _related_ Model (State in this case).
ForeignObject is not part of public API.
ForeignObject should ignore regular Field lookups
ForeignObjects should not have any form fields, currently the user needs to manually deal with the foreignobject relation.
Fork # of forks, # of hosts or serial, whichever is lowest
Forking automatically makes a copy of an in-memory database.
Form media can be combined to produce a single media definition.
Form.clean() is run even if other validation fails, so do the same with Model.clean() for consistency.
Form.errors will be an empty dictionary *but* Form.is_valid() will return False.
Form.initial overrides Field.initial.
FormSet allows us to use multiple instance of the same form on 1 page.
FormSet clean hook ########################################################## FormSets have a hook for doing extra validation that shouldn't be tied to any particular form.
FormSet has an is_valid method, and a cleaned_data or errors attribute depending on whether all the forms passed validation.
FormSet instances can also have an error attribute if validation failed for any of the forms.
FormSet instances has_changed method will be True if any data is passed to his forms, even if the formset didn't validate
FormSets with deletion ###################################################### We can easily add deletion ability to a FormSet with an argument to formset_factory.
FormSets with ordering ###################################################### We can also add ordering ability to a FormSet with an argument to formset_factory.
FormSets with ordering + deletion ########################################### Let's try throwing ordering and deletion into the same form.
Format IDs: 0 The video is being uploaded 1 The video is being processed 2 The video has at least one file ready 3 The video is unavailable due to an error
Format can be a custom python file, or by default the name of a module within gyp.generator.
Format dependencies and write out swappable dependencies right
Format imports nicely, swapping imports of functions from migration files for comments
Format of Accept-Language header values.
Format the argument string
Format the minor tick labels of the y-axis into empty strings with `NullFormatter`, to avoid cumbering the axis with too many labels.
Format upgrade_check_project_version with leading zeros as needed.
Format: (data type, PK value, Model Class, data)
Format: byte representation, text representation, encoding of byte representation
Formats asset search query to locate assets matching attributes, using the CQL search feature as described here: http://tumblr.github.io/collins/recipes.html
Formats must be opposite (video+audio)
Formatting the numbers in the path labels and the associated unit 8.
Formfield initial values ######## If the model has default values for some fields, they are used as the formfield initial values.
Forms can also define media, following the same rules as widgets.
Formsets can override the default iteration order
Fortran write followed by (C or F) read caused bus error
Fortran-like index ordering
Fortunately, for most symboles, we do not need to perform a function call.
Fortunately, master playlist can be easily distinguished from media playlist based on particular tags availability.
Fortunately, this logic is very fast, so it doesn't seem like we'll have to make it multi-threaded any time soon, so we can get away with sharing this field.
Fortunately, to match the implementation of allow_future, we need __lte, which doesn't conflict with __lt above.
Forward declared intermediate model
Found DISALLOW* macro outside a class declaration, or perhaps it was used inside a function when it should have been part of the class declaration.
Found an operator, update nesting stack
Found matching angle bracket
Found something - we'll let openssl autonegotiate and hope the server has disabled sslv2 and 3.
Found the end of the string, match leading space for this line and resume copying the original lines, and also insert a "" on the last line.
Four axes, returned as a 2-d array
Four forms are instantiated and no exception is raised
Frame opcodes defined in the spec.
Frame will be sized later by the Fit method
Frames vars are never shown in plain text email reports.
Frames vars are shown in html email reports.
FrameworksGroup and ProjectsGroup are top-level groups used to collect frameworks and projects.
Free up all file handles.
FreeBSD has options like this...
FreeBSD, DragonflyBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and OS X all implicitly add '-a' when running the command 'ifconfig'.
Freeing the memory allocated within GEOS
Fresh init tests don't care about which files changed, so we can just use the default .hhconfig in the template repo

Having // dummy comments makes the lines non-empty, so we will not get unnecessary blank line warnings later in the code.
Having a spacing of at least 2 just looks good.
Having been created by twinx, par2 has its frame off, so the line of its detached spine is invisible.
Having our buffer in the SRID of the transformation and of the field -- should get the same results.

Hence actual testing that exception was properly handled is done by relying on got_request_exception signal being sent.
Hence they're not added to good_commands.
Hence this paranoid conversion to create a valid cache key.
Hence we can safely use INNER join.
Hence we have to add the private fields separately from the topmost call.
Hence we make it optional.
Hence, some targets use copies for this.
Hence, the distinct removes one rating of 4.0 from the results.
Hence, there is no reliance on model._meta.app_label here, just using the model fields instead.
Here X, Y, and (optionally) Z were passed in individually, as parameters.
Here a code type of 1 is a MOVETO, and 2 is a LINETO.

Here comes the crazy part: In 2.6, if the xpath is a unicode, .//node does not match if a node is a direct child of .
Here eps is 1 so that if we get U, V by diffing the X, Y arrays, the vectors will connect the points, regardless of the axis scaling (including log).
Here goes the name and then ".html"
Here is a simple example showing how it is done.
Here is an example that labels the months, centered between the ticks
Here is some example code showing how to define some representative rc properties and construct a matplotlib artist using traits.
Here it is: changing the colormap for the current image and its colorbar after they have been plotted.
Here parse_cookie() differs from Python's cookie parsing in that it treats all semicolons as delimiters, even within quotes.
Here pre 18375 the amount of joins generated was random if dict randomization was enabled, that is the generated query dependent on which clause was seen first.
Here the native coordinate system ('data') is cartesian, so you need to specify the xycoords and textcoords as 'polar' if you want to use (theta, radius)
Here use .mp3 as it's the most popular one
Here we are figuring out the path to the SpatiaLite library (`libspatialite`).
Here we basically rewrite the level to 0.
Here we can just use a shallow copy since we are the last reference to it.
Here we check if the storage backend has a post_process method and pass it the list of modified files.
Here we check it for __init__ functions and return.
Here we generate a list of all acceptable HTTP referers, including the current host since that has been validated upstream.
Here we handle the case where it is specified as a string instead.
Here we have "unnamed" variables and we need a way to determine whether to replace a arg or not
Here we have to be careful to keep all y values positive:
Here we have to check if it's layeredtextures, or just textures:
Here we have to deal with 2 sub-cases 1) First sub-case: matrices of rank 2:
Here we have two clashed: id (automatic field) and clash, because both parents define these fields.
Here we set both to the same colour - if a figure is not to be filled, the renderer will set the brush to be transparent Same goes for text foreground...
Here we set up the parameters that will be passed in to field's function.
Here we set up the prototypes for the initGEOS_r and finishGEOS_r routines.

Here we try to deal with the colinear cases.
Here we try to deal with the simpliest colinear cases: a null gradient is assumed in this case.
Here's some real nastiness: Another "instance" of the six module might be floating around.
Here's the basic steps:
Here's the default case.
Here, it's -dynamiclib
Here, we define a custom ModelForm.
Here, we distinguish between different save types by checking for the presence of keys in request.POST.
Here, we make sure we're only catching this specific case and not another ImproperlyConfigured one.
Here, we skip any indexes across multiple fields.
Here, we will look at possible includes.

How the geometry column should be selected.
How to call the wrapped function
How to end lines in a python script one-liner
However allowing any language seems to workaround the issue.
However by recursing on __bases__ we may end up with duplicates and ordering issues, we therefore discard any duplicates and reorder the bases according to their index in the MRO.
However if the same fragment is immediately retried with the same request data this usually succeeds (1-2 attemps is usually enough) thus allowing to download the whole file successfully.
However it's still important to strip trailing slashes.
However only if there are any indices...
However saving the object is not allowed.
However since they have no data there is no risk of an inadvertent overwrite.
However test also a non refcounted struct on top of object.
However the current cookie parser doesn't do this and fixing it is much more work than fixing #20557.
However these methods are only implemented in subclasses to avoid confusion in the documentation.
However they are found in CL and other tools.
However this check is done only when the query executes, so you can use distinct() to remove the fields before execution.
However we don't want tblib to be required for running the tests when they pass or fail as expected.
However, CMake does provide the command link_directories, which adds link directories to targets defined after it is called.
However, Chrome will still consider example.com to be the hostname, so we must not allow this syntax.
However, IncrediBuild BuildConsole will parse the solution file, but then silently skip building the target causing hard to track down errors.
However, Jython doesn't support buffer (see http://bugs.jython.org/issue1521), so we have to be careful.
However, NaN is the only value that isn't equal to itself, so we can use this to identify NaN
However, a better solution than stringIO seems to be needed.
However, a reference should still be kept alive on the `Layer` returned.
However, a second check is necessary anyway (compile.c does that for Python), because Python's grammar doesn't stop you from defining `continue` in a module, etc.
However, an exception FieldDoesNotExist will be thrown if you specify a non-existent field name in values() (a field that is neither in the model nor in extra(select)).
However, clearing the select clause can alter results if distinct is used.
However, do apply checks if there is already an end of namespace comment and it's incorrect.
However, due to the efficient nature of the interpolation, this doesn't boost speed by much for quite a bit of complexity.
However, excluding GenericRelations means your lookups have to be a bit more explicit.
However, fake-apply one migration and it should now use the old two
However, for a test we still would like to download just a piece of a file.
However, hds and hls uris are still available.
However, if database sequences are reused (e.g. in the test suite after flush/syncdb), it isn't guaranteed that the next id will be 1, so we coerce it.
However, if we are annotating over a column of a related model, then it might be that column isn't part of the SELECT clause of the inner query, and we must manually make sure the column is selected.
However, in our case nose only looks for test_*.py files under the package directory, which should be safe.
However, in some cases, especially when multiple projects are open or when Xcode is busy, things don't work so seamlessly.
However, in that case the system will trigger an error with the level E_NOTICE
However, in this case the parent data isn't necessarily in the same order that Model.__init__ expects it to be, so we have to reorder the parent data.
However, it's a complicated algorithm.
However, related_model is a cached property, and all the models haven't been loaded yet, so we need to make sure we don't cache a string reference.
However, rescaling in this manner is consistent with the previous implementation and visually appears better than a "hard" clip.
However, sftp batch mode does not prompt for passwords so it must be disabled if not using controlpersist and using sshpass
However, since Jedi cannot be sure about the entry point, we just calculate an absolute path here.
However, starting at 3 or 4 we'd need to use non-existing migrations
However, starting at 3 to 5 cannot use the squashed migration
However, storing them at the class level is not thread safe.
However, that would make this class harder to subclass.
However, the CommonInfo class cannot be used as a normal model (it doesn't exist as a model).
However, the PostGIS ST_distance_sphere/spheroid() procedures may only do queries from point columns to point geometries some error checking is required.
However, the ``iterable`` function returns True if __getitem__ is present, but some classes can define __getitem__ without being iterable.
However, the last level (360) needs to be ignored often.
However, the specific kind of the declaration is not reported.
However, the specific kind of the expression is not reported.
However, the specific kind of the statement is not reported.
However, the view should NOT pass any user object on a form if the password reset link was invalid.
However, these characters must be included in the original query in case the query is being passed to SQL*Plus.
However, these fields *must* be included in uniqueness checks, so this can't be part of _get_validation_exclusions().
However, these tests expect warnings to be logged, so manually force warnings to the logs.
However, this adversely affects performance (i.e., Java is called to convert to WKT on every query).
However, this depends on the GDAL Driver in use.
However, this is complicated and error-prone.
However, those that return an array of strings should instead return a chararray, so some extra wrapping is required.
However, unlike a Form instance, cleaned_data and errors will be a list of dicts rather than just a single dict.
However, unordered sequences, such as sets, should be allowed but discouraged unless the user desires pseudorandom behavior.
However, users might want to have some say over which of /tmp or /var/tmp is used (because /tmp may be a tmpfs and want to conserve RAM or persist the tmp files beyond a reboot.
However, we *really* need to be sure we are checking for None as any data in initial that returns False on a boolean call needs to be treated literally.
However, we need the 'normal' action handler for the status check, so get it now via the action_loader
However, we need to ensure that we *always* do this.
However, we often build compilation units from header files here, so avoid the nag.
However, we want our coordinate system in degree
However, we will need to fully qualify the path because Sphinx requires absolute paths.
However, when our setup() runs, that gets overwritten and lost.
However: PyPy's own StringBuilder is fastest.
Hstore is not available on the database.
Http404 is returned if the list is empty.

I assume it's a function argument when the char before the whitespace is legal in a function name (alnum + _) and we're not starting a macro.
I believe this was meant to skip control bones, may not be useful.
I can assume now that only GET or POST requests make it this far ...
I don't know how current can be None, but sometimes it happens with Python3.
I don't know if VS2010 is sensitive to the exact names.
I don't know why these get reset in TeX.  Shift_amount is pretty much useless if we do.
I don't see a better way because distutils force config.h generation inside an Extension class, and as such sharing configuration informations between extensions is not easy.
I don't see any reason to use ghostscript to find the bounding box, as the required bounding box is alread known.
I don't think the above should ever happen.
I don't think there's a reasonable chance that a string operation is still correct, once we pass something like six objects.
I don't understand why these are different create a new coordinate sequence and populate accordingly
I found no way to figure out the number of Cores per CPU in OpenBSD
I found the structure of the ec2.py script very helpful as an example as I put this together.
I hate doing this, but I don't want to squash other import errors.
I have changed Numeric.py
I have full path, nothing else needs to be looked at
I have no idea what you're trying to do.
I hope that these shortcomings are addressed, I really liked having the rules handled directly in Xcode during the period that I was prototyping this.
I just pick the max one
I just try to capture the most common basic types, though there are more.
I know about `os.sep` and `os.altsep` but I want to leave some flexibility for hardcoding separators.
I locked it down by only having the 'cycler()' function available.
I might have fouled up the following:
I prefer this icon for warnings
I realized there was a cleaner way to do it, but am keeping this around as an example for how to get the data out of the axes.
I really don't agree with prefixing everything with 'ec2' because EC2, RDS and ElastiCache are different services.
I really should have read this: http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201206/eval_really_is_dangerous.html We should replace this eval with a combo of PyParsing and ast.literal_eval()
I submitted a patch to get this version, but it was only included for python 2.6.1 and above.
I think Python's parser does it in a different way and scans for the first statement/import with a tokenizer (to check for syntax changes like the future print statement).
I took a deeper look and tested heavily.
I took one version in my SxS directory: no idea if it is the good one, and we can't retrieve it from python
I used to have a try: finally: here but there seems to be a bug in python which swallows the KeyboardInterrupt The abandon now doesn't make too much sense
I wanted to name the parameter "from" but it's a Python keyword...
I will pass empty transform
I wish Xcode handled this automatically.
I'll color code by height, but you could use any scalar we need to normalize the data to 0..1 for the full range of the colormap
I'm ignoring masked values and all kinds of edge cases to make a simple example...
I'm just following the pattern used until now to not break any compatibility.
I'm just scared for my life.
I'm not quite sure what :standardizepath does.
I'm not sure if I get kernings right.
I'm not sure if the star import cache is really that effective anymore with all the other really fast import caches.
IDN or non-ascii in the local part
IE requires expires, so set it if hasn't been already.
IE7 occasionally returns an error "Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage" and doesn't load the next page.
IEEE doubles and floats only, otherwise the float32 conversion may fail.
IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: Most of the methods of this class are direct delegations to the free functions in this module.
IMPORTANT: Do not modify the input - we copy everything instead.
INTERMEDIATE_DIR and SHARED_INTERMEDIATE_DIR are used by gyp.generator.xcode.
INTERMEDIATE_DIR is a place for targets to build up intermediate products.
IP addresses and networks
IPv4 didn't work the first time, so it definitely has to be IPv6
IPv6 address for www.nhm.ku.edu
ISO formats are accepted, even if not specified in formats.py
Ideally this would modify every non-primary file, but that's harder to infer without actually parsing the arguments.
Ideally we should fetch the underlying value content and display (key, value) so user does not need to expand one more level to examine content.
Ideally, you'd want -0.5, -0.5 here, but then the snapping algorithm in the Agg backend will round this to a 2x2 rectangle from (-1, -1) to (1, 1).

If --tags or --skip-tags is given multiple times on the CLI and this is True, merge the lists of tags together.
If 2nd arg is zero, snprintf is used to calculate size.
If Animation._step signals that it reached the end and we want to repeat, we refresh the frame sequence and return True.
If Apache's mod_rewrite had a whack at the URL, Apache set either SCRIPT_URL or REDIRECT_URL to the full resource URL before applying any rewrites.
If DEBUG is on, check that we got a good receiver
If DISALLOW_EVIL_CONSTRUCTORS, DISALLOW_COPY_AND_ASSIGN, or DISALLOW_IMPLICIT_CONSTRUCTORS is present, then it should be the last thing in the class declaration.
If False, let the last argument overwrite any previous ones.
If False, never perform introspection.
If Gtk+ is installed, pkg-config is required to be installed
If HEX, unpack input to a binary buffer.
If John likes the idea, they could become rc parameters, for now they're hardwired.
If MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET is set, we simply trust the value and leave it alone.
If N is large one can see
If NULL is implied on columns without needing to be explicitly specified
If None, check if the migration has any dependencies to determine if there are dependencies to tell if db introspection needs to be done.
If None, the backend will use a sensible default.
If QUERY_STRING is absent or empty, we want to extract it from the URL.
If SRID is a string, e.g., '4326', then make acceptable as user input.
If SRID was passed in with the keyword arguments
If Template is instantiated directly rather than from an Engine and exactly one Django template engine is configured, use that engine.
If True it will raise an error if no login info is provided
If True, always perform introspection.
If True, don't use integer foreign keys referring to, e.g., positive integer primary keys.
If TypeError or ValueError raised while using isnan and co, just handle as before
If _forced_pk isn't set, this isn't a queryset query or values() or values_list() was specified by the developer in which case that choice is trusted.
If _repeat_delay is set, change the event_source's interval to our loop delay and set the callback to one which will then set the interval back.
If `None`, the return value of 'django.core.wsgi.get_wsgi_application' is used, thus preserving the same behavior as previous versions of Django.
If `a` is empty, nothing matters.
If `idx' is a string, it must be converted to an index via the underlying FixedStringMap.
If `names` is not None, update the names
If `value` is naive, astimezone() will raise a ValueError, so we don't need to perform a redundant check.

If a module is "corrupt" or not really a Python module or whatever.
If a non-related field is used like a relation, or if a single non-relational field is given.
If a number is duplicated in the set of ordering fields, for instance form 0 and form 3 are both marked as 1, then the form index used as a secondary ordering criteria.

If braces come on one side of an else, they should be on both.
If buffering will definitely happening, for instance because of a cast, only the items selected by the mask will be copied back from the buffer.
If build_file is a symlink, we must not follow it because there's a chance it could point to a path above toplevel_dir, and we cannot correctly deal with that case at the moment.
If build_file is just a leaf filename indicating a file in the current directory, build_file_dir might be an empty string.
If build_file is not in the current directory, parsed_build_file is not a usable path as-is.
If byteorder is given it forces a particular byteorder on all the fields (and any subfields)
If cleanup if called with an argument, it is a string naming a style, and the function will be passed as an argument to what we return.

If connector is AND and there is a filter that can match only when there is a joinable row, then use INNER.
If constraints aren't supported by the database, there's the unavoidable risk of data corruption.
If content comes to us as a dict it should be decoded json.
If content is defined make a temp file and write the content into it.
If content_type restriction isn't in the query's join condition, then wrong results are produced here as the link to b will also match (b and hs1 have equal pks).

If it's irreversible, error out
If it's not a valid directory name.
If it's not in the system library path (e.g., it cannot be found by `ctypes.util.find_library`), then it may be set manually in the settings via the `SPATIALITE_LIBRARY_PATH` setting.
If it's not representable as such we need to traceback and then blacklist such algorithms because it may impact calling code.
If it's not set, we don't want to leave the unexpanded variable in the path, so simply strip it.
If it's not yet migrated or has no migrations, we use __first__
If it's possible to find the superclass from the subclass and it's the correct superclass, it's working.
If it's recursive copy, destination is always a dir, explicitly mark it so (note - copy module relies on this).
If it's sufficiently datetime-like, it will have a `date()` method
If it's wrapped with quotes (single or double), then we're also dealing with a literal.

If no format was given on the command line, then check the env variable.
If no line, return the nearby point(s)
If no locations specified, then we try to build for every model in installed applications.

If not loaded, the load will trigger the checks.
If not properly quoted digits would be interpreted as an int.
If not provided, create the user with an unusable password
If not, add it to the list of pending operations for the model, where it will be executed with the model class as its sole argument once the model is ready.
If not, obey the cookie rules.
If not, say so and quit.
If not, then a shortcut means that we needn't invoke an invalidation up the transform stack as it will already have been invalidated.
If not, this is the first trip through ITERATING_SETUP, so we set the pending_setup flag and try to determine if we do in fact want to gather facts for the specified host.
If not, we'll be a good little HTTP citizen and redirect back to the changelist page.
If not, we'll try our cache, and get_template()
If nothing is passed in for frames, just use itertools.count, which will just keep counting from 0.

If one of the arguments returned by _as_mpl_axes defines __getitem__ but is not iterable, this would raise an execption.
If only one argument provided, set the coords array appropriately
If only one geometry provided or a list of geometries is provided in the first argument.
If os.remove() fails with ENOENT, the file may have been removed concurrently, and it's safe to continue normally.
If out_path is a directory and we're expecting a file, bail out now.
If packages are not provided, default to all installed packages, as DjangoTranslation without localedirs harvests them all.
If parameter has `input_size` attribute, use that.
If parent form class already has an inner Meta, the Meta we're creating needs to inherit from the parent's inner meta.
If parsed_build_file is absolute, it is usable as a path regardless of the current directory, and os.path.join will return it as-is.
If passed a file-like object, rec2csv should not close it.
If patch A is not set, self.bbox_patch is used.
If path is already just a leaf name, name will not be set.

If preserve default is off, don't use the default for future state
If previous line was _END_ASM, we will now shift to _NO_ASM state.
If previous line was a blank line, assume that the headers are intentionally sorted the way they are.
If previous section is different from current section, _last_header will be reset to empty string, so it's always less than current header.
If protocol is None, the URLs in the sitemap will use the protocol with which the sitemap was requested.
If psycopg is installed but not geos, the import path hits django.contrib.gis.geometry.backend which will "helpfully" convert an ImportError into an ImproperlyConfigured.
If ptp is, so is IQR and vice versa.
If registration is required for accessing this page, and the user isn't logged in, redirect to the login page.
If related object has a natural key, use it
If remote_field is None, we're ordering with respect to a GenericForeignKey and don't know what the foreign class is - we'll add those accessors later in contribute_to_class().
If requested, limit the total number of instances
If requirements are not met a CheckFailed should be raised in there.
If rhs is some Query, don't touch it.
If rolling back to a savepoint fails, mark for rollback at a higher level and avoid shadowing the original exception.
If rounding, round to the nearest multiple of half, the smallest increment
If saving to the same database, and this model is deferred, then automatically do a "update_fields" save on the loaded fields.
If self._choices is set, then somebody must have manually set the property self.choices.
If self.actions is explicitly set to None that means that we don't want *any* actions enabled on this page.
If self.bmp_data contains identical data blocks, keep the first one, remove duplicates and change the indexes in self.bmp_lookup to point to the first one.

If so we might be able to reuse the already loaded value.
If so, add the module to the model_list.
If so, this line is where we would add this information.
If so, use that, otherwise try to resolve name to address using system's resolver.
If so, we can take a shortcut here and simply prepend them to those attached to each block (if any)
If so, we can throw it now instead.
If so, we move into the always portion of the block, otherwise we get the next task from the list.
If so, we will clean those up in connect, disconnect and _live_receivers while holding self.lock.
If so, we will only send this task to the first host in the list.
If so, write the segment as is See https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/issues/9214
If some additional transformations are needed for the arguments and options, do it here.
If some work, check chroot.py to see how to disable just some methods.
If someone has marked an add form for deletion, don't save the object.
If someone tries to create an hstore field it will error there.
If source is a directory populate our list else source is a file and translate it to a tuple.
If source was defined as content remove the temporary file and fail out.
If specified header doesn't exist then remove any existing authenticated remote-user, or return (leaving request.user set to AnonymousUser by the AuthenticationMiddleware).
If ssh breaks we could leave tmp directories out on the remote system.
If still nothing, raise an error to make the problem easy to find.
If sub and superscript collide, move super up
If swappable is True, then see if we're actually pointing to the target of a swap.
If target_arch is not specified, then only install for the host architecture.
If tblib isn't installed, pickling the traceback will always fail.
If template_name isn't specified, it's not a problem -- we just start with an empty list.
If tests are invoke with "-Wall" (or any -W flag actually) then warning logging gets disabled (see configure_logging in django/utils/log.py).
If text anchoring can be supported, get the original coordinates and add alignment information.
If that doesn't update anything, do an INSERT.
If that fails we bail out.
If that happens, then also add having expressions to group by.
If that is not found, we resort to the simple name field, which doesn't have anything extra added to it.
If that template is not available, we should ignore the error in favor of re-raising the underlying exception that caused the 500 error.
If that's why, make it writable and try the op again.
If the "future" default manager was auto created there is no point warning the user since it's basically the same manager.
If the "id" attribute is specified in the Form and auto_id is True, the "id" attribute in the Form gets precedence.
If the #include is found in a public include directory, that header is expanded into the amalgamation header.
If the --driver-name part is required for some environment then make the inclusion of this part specific to that environment.
If the DB can group by primary key, then group by the primary key of query's main model.

If the Exception is CommandError and --traceback is present this command should raise the original CommandError as if it were not a CommandError.
If the GUID contains lowercase hex letters, MSVS will be fine.
If the GeometryField SRID is -1, then we shouldn't perform any transformation if the SRID of the input geometry is different.

If the User model has been swapped out, we can't make any assumptions about the default user name.
If the `geo_field_type` keyword was used, then enforce that type limitation.
If the action is a callable, just use it.
If the action plugin directly invokes the module (instead of going through a strategy) then we don't have a cross-process Lock specifically for this module.
If the active build configuration is changed, the project file must be closed and reopened if it is desired for the tree view to update.
If the annotation precedes the values clause, it won't be included unless it is explicitly named
If the app already exists, we add a dependency on the last migration, as we don't know which migration contains the target field.
If the app just doesn't have the module in question, we can ignore the error attempting to import it, otherwise we want it to bubble up.
If the app registry is not ready, reverse fields are unavailable, therefore we throw a FieldDoesNotExist exception.
If the application didn't restore the original autocommit setting, don't take chances, drop the connection.
If the appropriate environment variables are set, they override other configuration
If the argument starts with a slash or dash, it's probably a command line switch
If the artist does not use its default transform (e.g., Collections), you need to manually set their transform to the self.get_transform().
If the attr is a field name and not in the saved dictionary Undo any "setting" of the attribute and do a setfield Thus, you can't create attributes on-the-fly that are field names.
If the attribute is a list, just take the first element.
If the attribute was a property sheet attributes, we remove it, since they are useless.
If the backend does not support transactions, we should reload class data before each test
If the backend hasn't been used, no more retrieval is necessary.

If the backend is Oracle, test that we can call a standard stored procedure through our cursor wrapper.
If the backend is Oracle, test that we can pass cursor variables as query parameters.
If the backend is Oracle, test that we can save a text longer than 4000 chars and read it properly
If the backend needs to force an ordering we make sure it's the only "ORDER BY" clause present in the query.
If the backwards relation is disabled, replace the original related_name with one generated from the m2m field name.
If the bad value is set to have a color, then we override its alpha just as for any other value.
If the base address is not specifically controlled, DYNAMICBASE should be on by default.
If the caller didn't provide a path, there can be either multiple paths (PBXVariantGroup) or one.
If the caller is prepared to handle them, all is well.
If the child is a filter, we want to append all its children to this same list.
If the closing parenthesis is preceded by only whitespaces, try to give a more descriptive error message.
If the collection is made up of a single shape/color/stroke, it can be rendered once and blitted multiple times, using `draw_markers` rather than `draw_path_collection`.
If the command already has path elements (either relative or absolute), then assume it is constructed properly.
If the command is already loaded, use it directly.
If the common names don't match, we restart.
If the converter is specified by column names, use the index instead
If the credentials are proper JSON and we do not have the minimum required libcloud version, bail out and return a descriptive error
If the current locale can't encode the data, we let the user input the password manually.
If the database can't use chunked reads we need to make sure we evaluate the entire query up front.

If the destination file exists and allow_overwrite is False then raise an IOError
If the directory is relative to the documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.
If the dtype has a shape, the dtype occurs in the list more than once.
If the dtype is flattened, return.
If the dtype is not None, make sure we update it
If the dtype is uniform, don't define names, else use ''
If the dtype of an allocated output has a shape, the shape gets tacked onto the end of the result.
If the effective connector is OR and this node contains an aggregate, then we need to push the whole branch to HAVING clause.

If the expected value is zero, then return the absolute value of the difference.
If the expression didn't yield anything then it's likely a class.
If the field doesn't install a backward relation on the target model (so `is_hidden` returns True), then there are no clashes to check and we can skip these fields.
If the field has a relation, there should be only one of the 4 cardinality flags available.
If the field is a OneToOneField and it's been marked as PK, then this is a multi-table inheritance PK.
If the field is a primary key, then doing a query against the field's model is ok, too.
If the field is named as a radio_field, use a RadioSelect
If the field is nullable, allowing the save() would result in silent data loss.
If the field is required, clearing is not possible (the widget shouldn't return False data in that case anyway).
If the field specifies choices, we don't need to look for special admin widgets - we just need to use a select widget of some kind.
If the file came from the mac_bundle_resources list or if the rule is marked to process outputs as bundle resource, do so.
If the file exists, delete it from the filesystem.
If the file had no errors, return self.file_errors (which will be 0).
If the file has an encoding, encode unicode with it.
If the file has the wrong C++ extension, then we add a rule to copy that to intermediates and use the new version.
If the file size is less than N, we need to make sure not to seek past the beginning of the file
If the file type is not in the base set of filetypes, you should add it to the class-scope filetypes dictionary as follows:
If the filename already exists, add an underscore and a random 7 character alphanumeric string (before the file extension, if one exists) to the filename until the generated filename doesn't exist.
If the filename is to be excluded, go ahead and remove the counts that self.error added.
If the form is permitted to be empty, and none of the form data has changed from the initial data, short circuit any validation.
If the form's valid we can handle the action.

If the given URL is "Not Found", then check if we should redirect to a path with a slash appended.
If the given field does not have help text, nothing will be output.
If the group by is set to a list (by .values() call most likely), then we need to add everything in it to the GROUP BY clause.
If the groups aren't in the listed order, do a name comparison.

If the key already exists, then it must be a dummy node.
If the key isn't regex-able, just return as-is.

If the login url is the same scheme and net location then just use the path as the "next" url.
If the lookup parameters aren't real fields, then bail out.
If the manager is marked "use_for_related_fields", it'll get used instead of the "bare" queryset.

If the original parent didn't have a name but the child did, let the child's name live on.
If the original parent had a name set, keep using it.
If the output of the command starts with what looks like a PID, then the 'ps' command probably didn't work the way we wanted, probably because it's busybox
If the output path has variables in it, which happens in practice for 'copies', writing the environment as target-local doesn't work, because the variables are already needed for the target name.

If the property doesn't exist yet, create a new empty list to receive the item.
If the provided user is not authenticated, or no user was provided, filter the list to only public flatpages.
If the query used inner joins, then the join to fk_rel would remove o from the results.
If the queryset isn't already ordered we need to add an artificial ordering here to make sure that all formsets constructed from this queryset have the same form order.
If the raster argument is set to BILATERAL, then the operator cannot handle mixed geom-raster lookups.
If the related field isn't cached, then an instance hasn't been assigned and there's no need to worry about this check.
If the remote model does not have a default ordering, we order by its 'id' field.
If the request was POSTed, this might be a bulk action or a bulk edit.
If the resource lives in a .lproj bundle, add that to the destination.

If the sticky aligned flag is set to True, it makes the str() function use a dict representation with an 'aligned' flag
If the stride is not 8, NPY_RELAXED_STRIDES_CHECKING is messing them up on purpose:
If the strides are not reversed, the 0 in the arange comes last.
If the string already contains a "*/", it is turned into "(*)/".
If the string is a URL, assume png
If the string is not a complete xml document, we may need to add a root element.
If the subquery explicitly uses a different database, an error should be raised.
If the table's there, that's fine - we've never changed its schema in the codebase.
If the target and include share some initial basename component, it's possible the target is implementing the include, so it's allowed to be first, but we'll never complain if it's not there.
If the target file and the include we're checking share a basename when we drop common extensions, and the include lives in .
If the target is (app_label, None), that means unmigrate everything

If the user_stmt is not defined and the goto_path is multi line, something's strange.
If the value 'ansible_delegated_vars' is in the variables, it means we have a delegated-to host, so we check there first before looking at the variables in general

If there is a filter and the target does not match, exclude the target.
If there is a parent 'src' or 'java' folder, navigate up to it - these are canonical package root names in Chromium.
If there is a platform with more than one package manager, put the preferred one last.
If there is a reason for either of those to differ, then this mapping can be overridden after an instance of this class is created.

If there's some other error, this must be an error in Django
If these are present, then we check the second character instead.
If these lines are removed, the cursor won't appear the first time the box is clicked:
If they are bad (like in win32 Idle, PyCrust environments) then _exec_command_python (even slower) will be used as a last resort.
If they are not, then use a list instead.
If they generate any extra headers etc., the per-.o file dep tracking will catch the proper rebuilds, so order only is still ok here.
If they still want to merge it, then write out an empty file depending on the migrations needing merging.
If they supplied command line arguments, work out what they mean.
If they want to make an empty migration, make one for each app
If they want to merge and there is something to merge, then divert into the merge code

If this is a natural foreign key to an object that has a FK/O2O as the foreign key, use the FK value
If this is a one-to-one relation, set the reverse accessor cache on the related object to the current instance to avoid an extra SQL query if it's accessed later on.

If we have unmatched names that look like an ID, assume they are
If we haven't cached the background for this axes object, do so now.
If we haven't included a model in workset, we don't add the corresponding must_include fields for that model, since an empty set means "include all fields".

If you define a model with a callable default value, you cannot rely on the initial value in a form.
If you delete a reporter, his articles will be deleted.
If you don't pass any fields to values(), relation fields are returned as "foo_id" keys, not "foo".

If you set max_length in a CharField and its associated widget is either a TextInput or PasswordInput, then the widget's rendered HTML will include the "maxlength" attribute.
If you set this to False, Django will make some optimizations so as not to load the internationalization machinery.
If you set this to True, Django will format dates, numbers and calendars according to user current locale.
If you set this to True, Django will use timezone-aware datetimes.
If you specify a custom "attrs" that includes the "maxlength" attribute, the Field's max_length attribute will override whatever "maxlength" you specify in "attrs".
If you specify a different suffix, it will be appended regardless of the last character of the label.
If you try to raw_save a parent attribute onto a child object, the attribute will be ignored.
If you try to save a model created with such a form, you need to ensure that the fields that are _not_ on the form have default values, or are allowed to have a value of None.
If you try to test cases that are not allowed in Python, Jedi will maybe not show any completions.
If you use 'select' with extra() and names containing dashes on a query that's *not* a values() query, those extra 'select' values will silently be ignored.
If you want cleaning an empty value to return a different type, tell the field
If you want the validation message to be associated with a particular field, implement the clean_XXX() method on the Form, where XXX is the field name.
If you want to expire an object on January 1st of next year, this is how you do that."

In particular, for concrete models, the concrete_model is always the class itself.
In particular, it should not have any space before starting, and its size should be divisible by 4, most likely for alignement constraints when the xml is embedded in the binary...
In pixel/screen space
In place binary operation
In practice this happens when a decorator and a piece of middleware both operate on a given view.
In practice, migrations don't care about the app name, but we need something unique, and the label works fine.
In practice, this strips the top-level "src/" dir from the hierarchy in the solution.
In principle this could be extended to more nesting
In ps, 'comm' means the base command and 'command' is the full command.
In python 2 response HTTP headers are bytestrings
In python 3 stdout, stderr are text (unicode compliant) devices, so to emulate them import StringIO from the io module.
In range-based for, we wanted spaces before and after the colon, but not around "::" tokens that might appear.
In reality we handle this with the Python tokenizer, which avoids mis-detections due to nesting, comments and strings.
In recent versions of the v2 callback API, the play- book that started execution is given.

In restricted environments (such as Google App Engine), these are non-existent.
In some cases caption is null, which corresponds to None in python.
In some cases for a composite transform, an invalidating call to AFFINE_ONLY needs to be extended to invalidate the NON_AFFINE part too.
In some cases, Django would pick the wrong join type for the second relation, resulting in missing objects in the queryset.
In some live HDS streams (for example Rai), `fragments_count` is abnormal and causing out-of-memory errors.
In some rare cases exc_value.args can be empty or an invalid unicode string.
In tests, segments may be truncated, and thus FlvReader may not be able to parse the whole chunk.
In that URL, example.com is not the hostname but, a path component.
In that case error correction removes the right newline.
In that case it's the module of the function call.
In that case raise a more understandable exception (#23556).
In that case the next import may still fail, so keep it inside the try block.
In that case the parent model data is already present in the SELECT clause, and we want to avoid reloading the same data again.
In that case we just say the update succeeded.
In that case we need to return a Ref to the subquery's annotation.
In that case we'll give up as we're not sure they didn't include it in the .h file.
In that case, avoid adding fields from the same parent again.
In that case, restore original file name here so that the corresponding header file can be found.
In that case, test if srid is 4326 (WGS84), even if this is over-simplification.
In that case, the default value should be returned.
In that case, the expansion should result in a list.
In that case, we assume `clang` is corresponding to the best version of llvm tools found.
In that case, we fail quietly.
In the below formula we could take modulo 2.
In the case of `group_by_selected_pks` we also group by contact.id because of the select_related.
In the case of a concrete field with relation, includes the *_id name too
In the case of a loop, the delegated_to host may have been templated based on the loop variable, so we try and locate the host name in the delegated variable dictionary here
In the case of an import like `from x.` we don't need to add all the variables.
In the case of identical date values, these methods will use the ID as a fallback check.
In the code below, angles are expressed in deg/90.
In the example below, the xy point is in native coordinates (xycoords defaults to 'data').
In the first case, we don't want to update the dimension fields because we are already getting their values from the database.
In the following test, each condition is a check and logical comparison (or or and) that sets the rc value.
In the future I intend to add something like KeywordStatement
In the future add proper iterators and just make one call without crazy isinstance checks.
In the future we could optimize more types: * lists can be squashed together * dicts could squash entries that match in all cases except the name or pkg field.
In the future we should probably generalize this even further (mapping of param: squash field)
In the future, maybe it should just accept a list, and not the whole data dict.
In the future, we should probably design more sophisticated tests which compare resulting frames a-la matplotlib.testing.image_comparison
In the latest release, it is no longer necessary to do anything special to share axes across figures: ax1.sharex_foreign(ax2) ax2.sharex_foreign(ax1) ax1.sharey_foreign(ax2) ax2.sharey_foreign(ax1)
In the latter case, we want to package just the API exposed by the outermost module.
In the meantime we take this practical approach to solve a regression on 1.6 when the reverse manager in hidden (related_name ends with a '+').
In the moment there is no way to add extra data to a Geomtry in Three.js.
In the past, no systematic rules were enforced about inventory hostnames, but the parsing context (e.g. shlex.split(), fnmatch.fnmatch()) excluded various metacharacters anyway.
In the same transaction on the main connection, perform a queryset delete that covers the object deleted with the other connection.
In the same way, a do/while should never be on one line
In the second case, we do want to update the dimensions fields and will skip this return because force will be True since we were called from ImageFileDescriptor.__set__.
In the shippable CI, this fails with a UnicodeError with surrogateescape'd strings for an unknown reason (doesn't happen in a local Ubuntu16.04 VM)
In the two arg case, if a valid color spec is in data, we warn but use it as data...
In the x-direction, the hexagons exactly cover the region from xmin to xmax.
In this case Jedi is interested in the inserted params, not in the actual execution of the function.
In this case give back a plain field instance.
In this case there is no need adding specific models to the list.
In this case we are actually (ab)using them to do logical combination so it's consistent with other usage in Django.
In this case we don't want to accidentally change the type of the variable to a string by using the jinja template renderer.
In this case we return early on non-linux platforms.
In this case we simply don't perform the checks defined below.
In this case, base is None
In this case, it's up to you to call save() on the resulting model instance.
In this case, just return self._choices.
In this case, only the C_API_VERSION (*not* C_ABI_VERSION) would be increased.
In this case, preserve power in the segment, not amplitude
In this case, we also need to save the compile_deps for the target, so that the the target that directly depends on the .objs can also depend on those.
In this case, we don't have a file yet.
In this case, we need to compute a set of valid coordinates (1 among numerous possibilities), to ensure point 4).
In this case, we'll treat the '*' itself as the Name and return 0 for Param.stars.
In this case, you can implement db_type() instead of get_internal_type() to specify exactly which wacky database column type you want to use.
In this example, auto_id is False, but the "id" attribute for the "first_name" field is given.
In this example, grandparent would be set to path/to and parent_root would be set to Language.
In this example, the data dictionary doesn't include a value for the "nick_name" field, but cleaned_data includes it.
In this example, the data doesn't have a prefix, but the form requires it, so the form doesn't "see" the fields.
In this example, we don't provide a value for 'username', and the form raises a validation error rather than using the initial value for 'username'.
In this example, we pass a bunch of extra fields to the form constructor, but cleaned_data contains only the form's fields.
In this implementation we replace the password with 8 "*" which is also the length of our password.
In this particular case, scaling the axes wouldn't make sense, so we don't allow it.
In this video, music URLs (anti.s) are blocked outside China and USA, while the MV URL (mvurl) is available globally, so force the MV URL for consistent results in different countries
In this way we avoid calling the cached property.
In this way, we can overlay tex strings on arbitrary backgrounds with antialiasing
In those cases, content_type will be None.
In wxPython, drawing is performed on a wxDC instance, which will generally be mapped to the client aread of the window displaying the plot.
In.process_rhs() expects values to be hashable, so convert lists to tuples.
Incidentally, they have names denoting which part of the client made the request.
Include Stix sized alternatives for glyphs

Incorrect levels shouldn't have any messages.
Incorrect: APP_DIRS and loaders are mutually incompatible.
Increase the creation counter, and save our local copy.
Increasing rounds from 4 to 6 means an increase of 4 in workload, therefore hardening should run 3 times to make the timing the same (the original encode() call already ran once).
Increasing the attributes collected or the depth of recursion greatly increases runtime duration and potentially memory+network utilization.

InstanceElements are special, because they don't get copied, but have this wrapper around them.
Instances are typically faked, if the instance is not called from outside.
Instances of a dynamic Form do not persist fields from one Form instance to the next.

Instead of appending to lhs one character at a time, we do another regular expression match to consume several characters at once if possible.
Instead of high-res rasterization i use low-res.
Instead of sorting alphabetically, sort things in the order of the targets that produce the products.
Instead of starting the event source now, we connect to the figure's draw_event, so that we only start once the figure has been drawn.
Instead of throwing out 64 bits of the digest, xor them into the portion that gets used.
Instead of using -mimpure-text, you should compile all source code with -fpic or -fPIC."
Instead of using assert() which will crash debugger log an error message and tolerate this non-fatal situation.
Instead of using the MANIFESTUAC flags, we generate a .manifest to include into the list of manifests.
Instead the parent should set the _remove_method attribute directly.
Instead we don't worry about limit if only implicit localhost was in inventory to start with.
Instead we run it on the machine rsync is connecting to.
Instead, clear all caches when we're finished updating the model instances.
Instead, get the content type ID here, and later when the actual instance is needed, use ContentType.objects.get_for_id(), which has a global cache.
Instead, it favors the use of find_library and passing absolute paths to target_link_libraries.
Instead, just return the ContentType object and let the app detect stale states.
Instead, the coordinate will be flipped when this characters are used.
Instead, the message is marked for escaping by the template engine, so a template is needed to trigger the escaping.
Instead, we copy the install command instance, and finalize the copy so that it does not disrupt how distutils want to do things when with the original install command instance.
Instead, we just count the number of results).
Instead, we just use the stack pointer value for our most recent call into native code, along with the current PC.

Interactive manipulation
Interactive mode can be turned on without calling `plt.ion()` so register it again here.
Interactive panning and zooming is not supported with this projection, so we override all of the following methods to disable it.
Intermediate gain (vertical)
Intermediate loss (vertical)
Intermediate objects like Play() won't have their fields validated by default, as their values are often inherited by other objects and validated later, so we don't want them to fail out early

It allows makemigrations to declare dependencies on apps before they even have migrations.
It allows us to truncate tables referenced by a foreign key in any other table.
It also downloads the videos
It also handles drive letters differently than the pure Python implementation, so it's best not to replace it.
It also improves Jedi's speed for array lookups, since we don't have to check the whole source tree anymore.
It also overrides standard spines and axes instances as appropriate.
It also provides this range to the X-axis artist for ticking and gridlines
It also requires a fairly recent libtool, and if the system clang isn't used, DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH needs to contain the path to the libLTO.dylib that matches the used clang.
It also should not create INNER JOIN.
It also triggers a call to InfoArray.__array_finalize__
It also uses the arte_vp_url url from the webpage to extract the information
It can also be pre-cached by the forward accessor (ForwardManyToOneDescriptor).
It can also be pre-cached by the reverse accessor (ReverseOneToOneDescriptor).
It can always be turned back on to zero effect.
It can be added as many times as we want
It can be done right if this is deemed important.
It can be run with either Python 2 or 3.
It can be used for documentation purposes, though.
It can display more, but we'll look at how to do so later.
It can happen only if the state checker accepts a state that isn't handled above.
It can't be ever restricted to a smaller set, but additional columns in HAVING, ORDER BY, and SELECT clauses are added to it.
It cannot be used to check that setting a mode that is not equivalent to 0660 works.
It checks consistency in case of unsafe crashes in RocksDB.
It comes after the creation of CSRF cookies, so that everything else continues to work exactly the same (e.g. cookies are sent, etc.), but before any branches that call reject().
It comes out as a string of space-separated integers.
It contains exactly the same number of pixels of each color value of R, G and B, but in a totally different position.
It contains line breaks.
It crashed after the Field.get_db_prep_* refactor, because on most backends DateTimeFields supports usecs, but DateTimeField.to_python didn't recognize them.
It defaults to the language option or 'en' if the language is not set.
It defaults to the language option or en if the language is not set.
It defaults to the project name.
It depends on the copy target.
It disables certificate verification *globally*.
It does make sense for custom fields though, for example an enumfield that takes the enum class as an argument.
It does, however, keep a name.
It doesn't matter which answer we use to check the order, it will always be the same.
It doesn't respect the 'Range' header, it would download the whole video caused the travis builds to fail: https://travis-ci.org/rg3/youtube-dl/jobs/14493845#L59
It doesn't seem that it's possible to disable the context menu in recent versions of Chrome.
It follows the same pattern as the clean hook on Forms.
It gets emptied out every time the script is run
It gets used when an action plugin directly invokes a module instead of going through the strategies.
It has been left for API compatibility
It has changed, write it
It has to be run inside the django git root directory.
It includes each non_runtest_target that does not have suppress_wildcard set.
It is False by default so overriding self.clean() and failing to call super will stop validate_unique from being called.
It is a namespace, now try to find the rest of the modules on sys_path or whatever the search_path is.
It is allowed to filter on values that would be found from local model anyways.
It is also common to factor out a lot of these methods into common code used by a number of projections with similar characteristics (see geo.py).
It is also provided as a convenience to those who want to deploy these URLs elsewhere.
It is assumed that this part will have non-linear components (e.g., for a log scale).
It is assumes that the integration has been checked elsewhere.
It is available in Python 3.3+
It is based on make.py, the standard makefile generator.
It is composed of a list of fields pointing to the current model from other models.
It is defined below because it uses PBXContainerItemProxy, defined below.
It is done inside the cla.
It is easier here to make a separate call to contour than to set up an array of colors and linewidths.
It is generally faster to composite each image directly to the Figure, and there's no file size benefit to compositing with the Agg backend
It is hard to see where n would come from, though.
It is in the mobile version, but that seems to use a different URL structure altogether.
It is marked as outer join by above filter (even if it is trimmed away).
It is merged with a list that can come from the generator to create non_configuration_keys.
It is no longer incredibly sucky, but this list needs to be extended.
It is not displayed when a Form is rendered with any data (including an empty dictionary).
It is not meant to be used outside the backend
It is not necessary, but for the colormap, we need only the number of levels minus 1.
It is not sufficient to just rely on Name() to get the XCFileLikeElement's name, because that is not a complete pathname.
It is not sufficient to just rely on name and parent to build a unique hashable : a node could have two child PBXGroup sharing a common name.
It is not the way ansible generally invokes the module so it won't work in every case.
It is only applied once, regardless of the number of times it appears in a chain (to be changed in Django 2.0).
It is only guaranteed to exist and be constant within the context of a project, corresponding to a single input file.
It is only necessary to check the less-than comparison, so sorts that only follow the insertion sort path are sufficient.
It is possible for a figure to be closed, but a stale figure UI is still sending messages from the browser.
It is possible to order by reverse of foreign key, although that can lead to duplicate results.
It is possible to reuse U for the second subquery, no need to use W.
It is preserved because it is used by the oracle backend (django.db.backends.oracle.query), and also for backwards-compatibility with any external code which may have used this method.
It is retained here for backwards compatibility purposes.
It is set for visual reasons -- too low and corners start appearing ugly and jagged.
It is something, so let's try and build a CIDR from the parts
It is specific to each build environment.
It is the same as the python3 stdlib mock library
It is very heavily advised to keep each target in an entire project (even across multiple project files) using the same set of configuration names.
It is weird that GET and SCAN raise exception for non-existent key, while delete does not
It isn't part of a playlist
It isn't the safest thing, but seems to work.
It just means that it's going to load a build file that contains targets and is expected to provide a targets dict that contains the targets...
It knows how to validate a set of data and it knows how to render itself in a couple of default ways (e.g., an HTML table).
It looks for the first sequence of spaces immediately following the first newline, or at the beginning of the string.
It looks like the keys are the arguments that have to be passed as the hd field in the request url, we pick the higher Also, filter non-number qualities (see issue #3643).
It make sure exit ide connection with EOF does not crash the server.
It makes it easier to :      transform a variable into the native str type for the python version :      the code is running on.
It may also be an object with an urlpatterns attribute or urlpatterns itself.
It may be that a better solution would be a mechanism to disconnect all callbacks upon shutdown.
It may be the case that there was a syntax error in a function.
It may be used at some point in the future or we may just have the put/fetch operations not send back a final response at all
It may happen that the object is deleted from the DB right after this check, causing the subsequent UPDATE to return zero matching rows.
It may make sense to generate some .mk files on the side to keep the the files readable.
It may probably better to solve this by checking Content-Type for application/octet-stream after HEAD request finishes, but not sure if we can rely on this.
It might be a view, then no results will be returned
It might make sense to render each form as a table row with each field as a td.
It might not actually have a column behind it
It must match the value in lib/matplotlib.__init__.py and also needs to be changed below in the embedded windows build script (grep for "REMINDER" in this file)
It mustn't call get_app_config().
It needs every file separate, not a string else ./run barfs
It needs to be reloaded on access, so one query executed.
It needs to be serialized to relate the subclass instance to the superclass instance.
It plots a rasterized line and a normal image with implot.
It provides a "write" method for writing arbitrary strings in the file, and an "output" method that passes objects through the pdfRepr function before writing them in the file.
It requires ffmpeg (m3u8 download)
It scales the theta axis so the gridlines from 0.0 to 1.0, now go from 0.0 to 2pi.
It seems it is possible that self is not in all_models, so guard against that with default for get().
It seems like there's no problem with form feed characters here, because we're not counting lines.
It seems that some people are importing ConfigParser from here so is good to keep its class name.
It seems that there are not enough event notifications available to have this work on an as-needed basis at present.
It seems that when the python session is killed, Gcf can get destroyed before the Gcf.destroy line is run, leading to a useless AttributeError.
It seems there's a race between the creation of the .pdb by the precompiled header step for .cc and the compilation of .c files.
It should allow all existing related objects/inlines for a given object to be displayed, but not allow the creation of new inlines beyond max_num.
It should be added to extra.
It should be an er.Function/er.Class before that.
It should be possible for Oracle as well, but the semantics for  extracting the primary keys is trickier so it's not done yet.
It should be possible to compare *_lazy objects.
It should be x10 what the data suggests it should be
It should have one dependency, the parent xcode target.
It should raise an error even if the error doesn't occur in the last iteration of the ufunc inner loop
It simply ignores a limit and returns the whole offset number of videos.
It sometimes returns a wrong descent.
It supports https if key_file and cert_file are given.
It takes into account quoted quotes, and makes sure that the quotes match.
It tells us what we have to look to substitute in the module files and whether we're using module replacer or ansiballz to format the module itself.
It turns out that modern OpenStack auth is WAY more complex than this.
It turns out that this is good enough.
It uses its own database connection.
It uses the lower-cased object_name + "_set", but this can be overridden with the "related_name" option.
It was comparing the type numbers, but the new ufunc function-finding mechanism finds the lowest function to which both inputs can be cast - which produces 'l' when you do 'q' + 'b'.
It was introduced in Python 2.5 and already deprecated in Python 2.6.
It will (essentially) increment the extra argument
It will be appropriately resolved if required.
It will be first clipped by patchA and patchB.
It will get a default common name like user.nuclide.host
It will get re-populated in the cloned queryset the next time it's used.
It will only be called by re.sub with match.group(0) containing a character matched by the the _escaped expression.
It will raise an exception if not valid.
It will still be exported from extras.py for compatibility.
It will try to save the deleted session which will cause an UpdateError that's caught and raised as a SuspiciousOperation.
It won't be for deeper levels.
It won't be guaranteed to be correct until contribute_to_class is called.
It won't have an opened file.
It works fine as far as I can tell however.
It works only good that way.
It would be better if the zipfile could read (or at least uncompress) the data directly into the array memory.
It would be better to use a Triangulation object if the same triangulation was to be used more than once to save duplicated calculations.
It would be nice (but not too important) to skip the middle join in this case.
It would be nice to be able to handle this, but the queries don't really make sense (or return consistent value sets).
It would seem obvious to call these next two members 'template' and 'context', but those names are reserved as part of the test Client API.
It'll be multiplied by 100 later.
It'll blow up if the args aren't immutable, among other "problems".
It'll sometimes give (end_row_past_finish, 0)
It's OK to change the number of fragments for live streams as they are updated periodically
It's a boolean : make a record
It's a record: make sure the dtype is correct
It's a side-effect of using constants here and not a real concern.
It's a tradeoff between allowing reasonable code and avoiding trying to parse more C++ using regexps.
It's actually a link to a flv file
It's an IPv6 address without a port.
It's an actual non-HTML word or char
It's an application with migrations disabled.
It's an error for a target to depend on all other targets in the same file, because a target cannot depend on itself.
It's an error for a user to have add permission but NOT change permission for users.
It's best when the caller provides the path.
It's called `settings_dict` instead of `settings` to disambiguate it from Django settings modules.
It's called self._request because self.request gets overwritten by django.test.client.Client.
It's case-insensitive
It's defined in the base class to minimize code duplication.
It's defined to be 255 bytes or less, but this includes one byte for the length of the name and one byte for the trailing dot that's used to indicate absolute names in DNS.
It's different from None.
It's easier to create it like that:
It's easier to salt here and be consistent later, rather than add different code paths in the checks, although that might be a tad more efficient.
It's enough that the form saves without error -- the custom save routine will generate an AssertionError if it is called more than once during save.
It's especially a problem on Windows.
It's going to be created below if needed.
It's handled in LoadTargetBuildFileCallback.
It's hard to tell, though, so we punt on this one for now.
It's hard to test for constant time, just test the result.
It's important to get the "All" target first, though.
It's in lib.stride_tricks, though, so we can't import it here.
It's in the SUNWPython-devel package which also contains development files that don't belong on production boxes.
It's just a collection of functions.
It's necessary to preserve the historical behavior of request_finished.
It's neither necessary nor appropriate to use django.utils.encoding.force_text for parsing URLs and form inputs.
It's not a section, so the current state tells us what kind of definition it must be.
It's not a valid IPv4 CIDR
It's not a valid IPv6 CIDR.
It's not about the values inside, it's about the names.
It's not actually a unique constraint.
It's not guaranteed that the system-provided arc functions are accurate down to a few epsilons.
It's not mentioned in MPEG-DASH standard.
It's not needed anyway, since the Form XObject includes it in its BBox value.
It's not numerical CIDR, give up
It's not possible for gmock macros to appear in the first 2 lines, since the class head + section name takes up 2 lines.
It's not rocket science.
It's not valid Python, but still better than an INDENT in the second line (and not in the first).
It's not worth attempting to compress really short responses.
It's obviously a relative import to the current module.
It's ok not to have spaces around binary operators like + - * /, but if there's too little whitespace, we get concerned.
It's ok to have many commands in a switch case that fits in 1 line
It's okay to use a model's pk property.
It's only used for debugging on the remote machine.
It's possible one outputs on stderr and the other on stdout, hence the set
It's possible that by giving it always the sys path (and not the __path__ attribute of the parent, we get wrong results and nested namespace packages don't work.
It's possible that the matching algorithm could use the wrong value even if the ETag header is set correctly correctly (as tested by test_unquoted()), so check that the unquoted value is matched.
It's possible to associate the errors to particular field with the Form.add_error() method or by passing a dictionary that maps each field to one or more errors.
It's possible to construct a Form dynamically by adding to the self.fields dictionary in __init__().
It's possible to get to the value which would be used for rendering the widget for a field by using the BoundField's value method.
It's possible to have the unique and PK constraints in separate indexes.
It's possible to use 64-bit kernel with 32-bit userland, e.g. to give linker slightly more memory.
It's possible to use values() calls across many-to-one relations.
It's preferable to keep dependencies listed first during a link phase so that they can override symbols that would otherwise be provided by libraries, which will usually include system libraries.
It's probably a playlist
It's really reported to be published on year 2077
It's safe to drop ordering if the queryset isn't using slicing, distinct(*fields) or select_for_update().
It's selected when winrm is the connection
It's something like generic foreign key.
It's still using the changelist ordering from before User2's edits in step 2.
It's stupid to replace and append simultaneously, for example.
It's sufficient that this query runs without error.
It's too late to prevent an unsafe request with a 412 response, and for a HEAD request, the response body is always empty so computing an accurate ETag isn't possible.
It's up to the user of the iterator to obey the requested semantics.
It's used for recording which joins exist in the query and what types they are.
It's very probable that the token is missing because of misconfiguration, so we raise a warning
It's worth testing that parameters are quoted.
Item normally requires a join with Note to do the default ordering, but that isn't needed here.
Items for which no exclusion or inclusion has been applied (yet) have value -1, items excluded have value 0, and items included have value 1.

Iterate through result and add the values, that's possible only in for loops without clutter, because they are predictable.
Iterate through the storage to simulate consumption of messages.
Iterate until a key argument is found.
Iterate using an index so that new values can be assigned into the_list.
Iterated all productions.
Iteratively follow a definition until a non-import definition is found.
Iterator inner double loop was wrong on this one
Iterator inner loop should take argument contiguity into account
Its already a Ref to subquery (see resolve_ref() for details)
Its input is a set of swift files, containing functions named 'bench_*' that take no arguments and returns Int.
Its subexpression might contain Cols.

MySQL doesn't support tz-aware datetimes
MySQL doesn't support tz-aware times
MySQL emits a warning when broken data is saved
MySQL is returning a raw float value
MySQL needs a little prodding to reject invalid data.
MySQL requires that the values calculated for expressions don't pass outside of the field's range, so it's inconvenient to use the values in the more general tests.
MySQL spatial indices can't handle NULL geometries.
MySQL stores positive fields as UNSIGNED ints.
MySQLdb-1.2.1 and newer automatically makes use of SHOW WARNINGS on MySQL-4.1 and newer, so the MysqlDebugWrapper is unnecessary.
MySQLism: Columns in HAVING clause must be added to the GROUP BY.
MySQLism: zero in AUTO_INCREMENT field does not work.
N-N  (i.e., many-to-many) relations aren't candidates for deletion.
N.B This makes the invalidation sticky, once a transform has been invalidated as NON_AFFINE, then it will always be invalidated as NON_AFFINE even when triggered with a AFFINE_ONLY invalidation.
NB states grows while we're iterating
NB: MPD manifest may contain direct URLs to unfragmented media.
NB: The generated SQL below is specific to SQLite Note: The DELETE FROM...
NB: The order values must be changed so that the items are reordered.
NB: a copy of this function exists in ../../modules/core/async_wrapper.py.
NB: higher priority numbers sort first
NB: the cancellation error at the switchover is at least eps
NB: this can hang if the receiver is still running (eg, network failed a Send request but the server's still happy).
NB: use relative changes because some styles may have a figure size different from the default one.

NOTE: There could still have been a 0-sized Ellipsis between them.
NOTE: There is no need to remap parent dependencies as we can assume the replaced nodes already have the correct ancestry.

NUMBER column: decimal-precision floating point This will normally be an integer from a sequence, but it could be a decimal value.
NUMBER(p,s) column: decimal-precision fixed point.
NaN is the only possible bad value, so no further action is needed to handle bad results.
NaN, inf, or negative numbers are all possible bad values, so explicitly replace them with NaN.

Need to convert File objects provided via a form to unicode for database insertion
Need to copy this dictionary or else the next time around in the cycle, the dictionary could be missing entries.
Need to detect Xen paravirt because it exposes cpuinfo differently than Xen HVM or KVM and causes reporting of only a single cpu core.
Need to disconnect the first draw callback, since we'll be doing draws.
Need to do this explicitly since unregister_model() doesn't clear the cache automatically (#24513)
Need to do this to show that what we send doesn't cause an issue once it gets to the daemon.

Normally numpy is installed if the above import works, but an interrupted in-place build could also have left a __config__.py.
Normally the xcode-ninja generator includes only valid executable targets.
Normally we would remove just the stuff after the index, but if the option is set remove the index as well.
Normally, isnan and isinf are macro (C99), but some platforms only have func, or both func and macro version.

Not necessary to have valid credentails for the test.
Not passing in a geometry as first param should raise a type error when initializing the GeoQuerySet
Not providing a transform of None puts the ellipse in data coordinates .
Not providing a transform, and then subsequently "get_transform" should not mean that "is_transform_set".
Not really necessary anymore thanks to the __getattr__ flattening in ContextList, but has some edge-case backwards-compatibility implications.
Not sure I like having two params attached to the same Knob, but that is what we have here...
Not sure about the first state as there could be some writer which set rcparams assert not animation.writers._dirty
Not sure how to handle the case where errmess contains only warning messages and that should not be treated as errors.
Not sure what to do in that case: manifest building will fail, but it should not be used in that case anyway
Not sure why this is needed - ADS
Not the current block, ignore it
Not used, but required by AppConfig.__init__
Not using _extract_m3u8_formats here as individual media playlists are also included in published_urls.
Not using a tuple should crash
Not using urlparse here as it does not handle unknown schemes well.
Not usually a good idea to pass in a datetime here (it loses information), but this can be a side-effect of interacting with a database backend (e.g. Oracle), so we'll be accommodating.
Not very inspired, but it's what Xcode uses.
Not worth the extra complexity when you can write a real query instead.
Not-None src_link signals the need for a source link in the generated html
Not-necessarily-technical managers of the site.

Note -- if we have a global function to setup, that would be a better place to run this
Note -- this is a Mapping, not a MutableMapping
Note 1: If we drew markers here, most markers would be drawn more than once as they belong to several edges.
Note : the 'order' keyword looks broken, let's just drop it
Note different super-calling style to backend_qt5
Note if you use different interpolations for the images their apparent extent could be different due to interpolation edge effects
Note logic here: We only *use* self._ufunc if func is self.pyfunc even though we set self._ufunc regardless.
Note mixed byteorder.
Note negative values are ok
Note on Dependencies and Libraries: CMake wants to handle link order, resolving the link line up front.
Note passlib salt values must be pure ascii so we can't let the user configure this
Note proxy not needed in python 3.
Note that 'alias', 'saveopts' and 'setopt' commands also seem to work fine as they are, but are usually used together with one of the commands below and not standalone.
Note that (as TeX) y increases downward, unlike many other parts of matplotlib.
Note that .dev0 sorts backwards (a dirty tree will appear "older" than the corresponding clean one), but you shouldn't be releasing software with -dirty anyways.
Note that .tlb is not included in the outputs as it is not always generated depending on the content of the input idl file.
Note that Adrian's age is 34 in the fixtures, and he has one book so both conditions match one author.
Note that Cormen uses 1-based index
Note that ETS requires the version 2 of PyQt4, which is not the platform default for Python 2.x.
Note that Python sort is stable.
Note that STATIC_URL cannot be empty.
Note that UnixCCompiler._compile appeared in Python 2.3
Note that Windows is not affected and produces playable files (see https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/issues/8300).
Note that _sharedmask has lots of false positives.
Note that bdist_mpkg breaks this if building a dev version with a git commit string attached.
Note that both fields are not unique.
Note that concatenating two vertices needs to make a vertices for the frame.
Note that dead weakref cleanup happens as side effect of using the signal's receivers through the signals API.
Note that dlamch_() calls will be replaced by the macros below by clapack_scrub.scrub_source()
Note that doing the cleanup here isn't a good idea, _remove_receiver() will be called as side effect of garbage collection, and so the call can happen while we are already holding self.lock.
Note that even if the group_by is set, it is only the minimal set to group by.
Note that event is a MplEvent
Note that for PostgreSQL the GROUP BY clause must include the primary key of every table, but for MySQL it is enough to have the main table's primary key.
Note that for historical reasons we want to include also private_fields here.
Note that if a model is unmanaged we short-circuit and never try to install it
Note that if dtype is not of inexact type then arraymean will not be either.
Note that if you get a tagged build and then dirty it, you'll get TAG+0.gHEX.dirty exceptions: 1: no tags.
Note that in Form.clean(), you have access to self.cleaned_data, a dictionary of all the fields/values that have *not* raised a ValidationError.
Note that in Python 3, maximum line length has increased from 76 to 78
Note that in the following, we explicitly pass in a subset of the contour levels used for the filled contours.
Note that in this example we could just as well have the __gte clause and the OR clause swapped.
Note that it can be tricky sometimes w/ type comparison
Note that it is not included in __all__, but rather exported from extras in order to avoid backward compatibility problems.
Note that ldflags goes at the end so that it has the option of overriding default settings earlier in the command line.
Note that libclang maintains a separate set of token enumerations from the C++ API.
Note that no copy of zero-sized arrays is made.
Note that not all possible configuration values are present in this autogenerated file.
Note that on Oracle the table name is upper case in the generated SQL, thus the .lower() call.
Note that operator.index(np.array(True)) does not work, a boolean array is thus also deprecated, but not with the same message:
Note that pep8 will flag these tests.
Note that prefix should already be all lowercase.
Note that proxy_for_model can create a chain of proxy models.
Note that single quotes are used because this is a string (and could otherwise cause a collision with a field name).
Note that some of these are C99 functions.
Note that testapp (author) has no dependencies, otherapp (book) depends on testapp (author), thirdapp (edition) depends on otherapp (book)
Note that testapp (author) has no dependencies, otherapp (book) depends on testapp (authorproxy)
Note that the Bayesian estimate requires the number of data points to exceed degree + 3.
Note that the _M versions need to come first for substring matching to work.
Note that the above filters on a force the join to an inner join even if it is trimmed.
Note that the argument to `byteswap` is 'inplace', thus if we have already made a copy, do the byteswap in place, else make a copy with the byte order swapped.
Note that the caller is to be expecting a list in return, and not all callers do because not all are working in list context.
Note that the code below adds actions to this target, so if you move these two lines, move the lines below as well.
Note that the contour lines don't extend to the edge of the box.
Note that the end result will be: (outercol NOT IN innerq AND outercol IS NOT NULL) OR outercol IS NULL.
Note that the first argument is assumed to be the command.
Note that the name has not changed - name is an attribute of Place, not ItalianRestaurant
Note that the name numpy.core._internal._reconstruct is embedded in pickles of ndarrays made with NumPy before release 1.0 so don't remove the name here, or you'll break backward compatibilty.
Note that the offset in a TZ value is the negative of the way it's usually written, e.g. UTC+1 would be xxx-1:00.
Note that the old attributes are simply forgotten even if the boxstyle name is same.
Note that the rect argument of *auto_adjust_subplotpars* specify the area that will be covered by the total area of axes.bbox.
Note that the results are in FORTRAN order, hence the h arrays are transposed.
Note that the results need to be normalized, otherwise the huge values that can arise from fast growing functions like Laguerre can be very confusing.
Note that the single quote is repeated
Note that the stock python on SunOS has a bug where fcntl.flock(fd, LOCK_EX) always fails with EBADF, that's why we use this F_SETLK hack instead.
Note that the transform of the Axes itself (i.e., transData) is not affected by the given transform.
Note that the types may differ, the actual type used is determined by the assign_identity function and is not the same as the type returned by the identity method.
Note that the warning is spurious, because the test checks for weights while a is ignored.
Note that there is a race between os.path.exists and os.makedirs: if os.makedirs fails with EEXIST, the directory was created concurrently, and we can continue normally.
Note that these tests are testing internal implementation details.
Note that this check is necessary on Google App Engine, because the subsequent check will succeed even though p may not be writable.
Note that this class is different than Form.
Note that this could be accomplished in one try-except clause, but instead we use get_or_create when creating unknown users since it has built-in safeguards for multiple threads.
Note that this could cause an OverflowError here that we're not catching.
Note that this expression matches the characters listed with "+", for 1 or more occurrences: if a string is empty, it must not match this pattern, because it needs to be encoded as "".
Note that this line will raise a warning for dot_a, dot_b or dot_c zeros, but we choose not to support triangles with duplicate points.
Note that this may cause some suites to not contain any statements at all.
Note that this means results that might otherwise be distinct are not (if there are multiple values in the ordering cols), as in this example.
Note that this model doesn't have "get_latest_by" set.
Note that this must be two directories beneath src/ for unit tests to pass, as they reach into the src/ directory for data with relative paths.
Note that this only happens with the BuildConsole, and does not occur if IncrediBuild is executed from inside Visual Studio.
Note that this only retrieves comments that are initally loaded.
Note that this only scans back one line, since scanning back arbitrary number of lines would be expensive.
Note that this pattern will also pass on assignments of "0" to function pointers, but the preferred values for those would be "nullptr" or "NULL".
Note that this relies on the Python dict comparison operator comparing componentwise lexicographically based on the alphabetical ordering of keys.
Note that this routine does not work for a polar axis, because of the 1e-10 below.
Note that this works for line plots.
Note that we accept C style "/* */" comments for terminating namespaces, so that code that terminate namespaces inside preprocessor macros can be cpplint clean.
Note that we calculate separately a list of extra select columns needed for grammatical correctness of the query, but these columns are not included in self.select.
Note that we can't just use ipaddress.ip_address() because we also have to accept ranges in place of each component.
Note that we can't trim joins at this stage - we will need the information about join type of the trimmed joins.
Note that we can't use an assertion because some of the gyp tests depend on this.
Note that we decide whether or not to create a Host based solely on the (non-)existence of its hostname in self.hosts.
Note that we don't have to detect malformed Javascript, only properly lex correct Javascript, so much of this is simplified.
Note that we don't need to execute a query, just build it.
Note that we don't want to run the above doctests because they will fail without a from __future__ import with_statement
Note that we may detect clash between user-defined non-unique field "id" and automatically added unique field "id", both defined at the same model.
Note that we must be careful so that we have params in the same order as we have the parts in the SQL.
Note that we must do the conversions in SQL instead of in Python to support F() references.
Note that we need to keep the original order intact, because cache implementations may rely on the order of the Vary contents in, say, computing an MD5 hash.
Note that we need to test for C_CONTIGUOUS first because a 1-D array is both C_CONTIGUOUS and F_CONTIGUOUS.
Note that we use ids instead of instances.
Note that we will be creating duplicate joins for non-m2m joins in the AND case.
Note that we're assuming OSError means that the client program isn't installed.
Note that we're calling MultiWidget, not SplitDateTimeWidget, because we want to define widgets.
Note that we're instantiating a new ModelChoiceIterator *each* time _get_choices() is called (and, thus, each time self.choices is accessed) so that we can ensure the QuerySet has not been consumed.
Note that you must re-run 'versioneer.py setup' after changing this section, and commit the resulting files.
Note that you need to be careful here to use the flags that ccache and distcc can understand.
Note that,the acceptable Locator and Formatter class is a bit different than that of mpl's, and you cannot directly use mpl's Locator and Formatter here (but may be possible in the future).
Note the transpose currently because matrices do *not* support dimension fixing for fancy indexing correctly.
Note, for GeoIP Country, Region and Netspeed databases, GEOIP_INDEX_CACHE is equivalent to GEOIP_MEMORY_CACHE
Note, however, that this flexibility comes with the responsibility of displaying all the errors, including any that might not be associated with a particular field.
Note, if no dot is found, this will give the entire filename as the ext.
Note, matplotlib artists use the doc strings for set and get methods to enable the introspection methods of setp and getp.
Note, not Iterable because we don't want to handle strings like that.
Note, sha1 is the only hash algorithm compatible with python2.4 and with FIPS-140 mode (as of 11-2014)
Note, these are untransformed coordinates
Note, this is an exact copy of BlendedAffine2D.__eq__
Note, this is an exact copy of BlendedAffine2D.contains_branch_seperately
Note, this is an exact copy of BlendedGenericTransform.__eq__
Note, this is an exact copy of BlendedTransform.contains_branch_seperately
Note, we are using an id of 1006 here since tests that run before this may create categories with primary keys up to 6.
Note, we ignore value arg here and just go by state of the params
Note, we must cache the weakref versions.
Note:  It would be possible to use matplotlib's transforms to rotate, scale, and translate the arc, but since the angles are discrete, it's just as easy and maybe more efficient to do it here.
Note: .H indicates the conjugate transposed / Hermitian.
Note: Do not add any code to this file.
Note: Don't make c++0x to c++11 so that c++0x can be used with older clangs that don't understand c++11 yet (like Xcode 4.2's).
Note: Don't try to check for m.any(), that'll take too long
Note: FigureCanvasBase.draw() is inconveniently named as it clashes with the deprecated gtk.Widget.draw()
Note: If we need to import from release.py first, remember to catch all exceptions: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/16523
Note: In Oracle, we expect a null CharField to return '' instead of None.
Note: Inherit from SortedOptParser so that we get our format_help method
Note: No requirement for reset of auto-incremented indices (cf.
Note: Numeric values (including the names) should be consistent with '_GraphemeClusterBreakPropertyValue' enum on the Swift side, and with 'GraphemeClusterBreakProperty' in the compiler C++ code.
Note: Only used for loading obsolete VaultAES files.
Note: OpenBSD has sysutils/flock.
Note: Requires both the GeoIP country and city datasets.
Note: Requires use of both the GeoIP country and city datasets.
Note: The image has been scrambled in a specific way, by having each color component of each pixel randomly placed somewhere in the image.
Note: The middle model is not actually a valid through model, but that doesn't matter, as we never render it.
Note: There is a notebook in lib/matplotlib/backends/web_backend/nbagg_uat.ipynb to help verify that changes made maintain expected behaviour.
Note: This cannot be calculated until this is added to an Axes
Note: This could throw a unicode error if value's __str__() method returns non-ascii.
Note: This flag is a no-op for clang, it only has an effect for gcc.
Note: This is for checking that all the different ways of specifying 0660 mode work.
Note: This is n_resources * n_outputs_in_rule.
Note: This test can result in false positives if #ifdef constructs get in the way of brace matching.
Note: Using nose's generator test cases here so we can't inherit from unittest.TestCase
Note: Using the ajax API, as the public Streamable API doesn't seem to return video info like the title properly sometimes, and doesn't include info like the video duration
Note: We do these last even though we have to call to_bytes again on the value because we're optimizing the common case
Note: We do these last even though we have to call to_text again on the value because we're optimizing the common case
Note: We run this here to cache whether the default ansible ssh executable supports control persist.
Note: We use .decode() here, instead of six.text_type(s, encoding, errors), so that if s is a SafeBytes, it ends up being a SafeText at the end.
Note: Wellington has an 'X' value of 174, so it will not be considered to the left of CO.
Note: When getting Sequence from collections, it matches with strings.
Note: __file__ allows the doctest in NoseTester to run without producing an error
Note: `or ''` below is required because `module_path` could be
Note: actool crashes if inputs path are relative, so use os.path.abspath to get absolute path name for inputs.
Note: by default PK ordering.
Note: caller is assumed to hold self.lock.
Note: cludge to get an answer of the same type as supertensor.
Note: contouring simply excludes masked or nan regions, so instead of using the "bad" colormap value for them, it draws nothing at all in them.
Note: docker supports running as non-root in some configurations.
Note: don't exclude the field from validation if the model field allows blanks.
Note: draw is required here since bits of state about the last renderer are strewn about the artist draw methods.
Note: event.xdata/ydata in data coordinates, event.x/y in pixels
Note: flat_list is already sorted in the order from dependencies to dependents.
Note: freetype has no build profile for 2014, so we don't bother...
Note: if a subclass overrides __init__(), it will likely need to override __copy__() and __deepcopy__() as well.
Note: if you change any of these parameters, don't forget to update the ASCII art above.
Note: in typical case this loop executes _strip_once once.
Note: including Python.h is necessary because it modifies some math.h definitions
Note: intentionally no order_by(), that case needs tests, too.
Note: np.meshgrid gives arrays in (ny, nx) so we use 'F' to flatten xpos, ypos in column-major order.
Note: only want to represent the encrypted data
Note: os.path.join treats '/' as os.sep on Windows
Note: sh is the default shell plugin so this plugin may also be selected if the filename is not listed in any Shell plugin.
Note: slightly wrong, this is written so that implicit localhost Manage passwords
Note: std::hash is their hash, ::hash is our hash
Note: strings are encoded as UTF-8.
Note: table_alias is not necessarily known at instantiation time.
Note: the base classes need to be in that order to get isAvailable() from ImageMagickBase called and not the one from MovieWriter.
Note: the docstring is autogenerated.
Note: the extra ordering must appear in select clause, so we get two non-distinct results here (this is on purpose, see #7070).
Note: the following three methods only work in subclasses that also inherit SingleObjectMixin or MultipleObjectMixin.
Note: there's no reason why we couldn't accept variable definitions here, and set them on the named child group.
Note: this is called by Axes.__init__() stash the current visibility state
Note: this must work also with object and integer arrays
Note: try not to do many things here, as it will contaminate global namespace of the interpreter.
Note: typecasting for datetimes is needed by some 3rd party database backends.
Note: vault should return byte strings because it could encrypt and decrypt binary files.
Note: verified we have SSLContext when we parsed params
Note: we shouldn't set the dtype of the output from the first result so we force the type to object, and build a list of dtypes.
Note: when combining the query we need to have information available about the join type of the trimmed "creator__isnull" join.
Note: x,y are device/display coords, not user-coords, unlike other draw_* methods
Note: zlogin invokes a shell (just like ssh does) so we do not pass this through /bin/sh -c here.
Nothing else can be a link dependency of them, there can only be dependencies in the sense that a dependent target might run an executable or load the loadable_module.
Nothing in the variable, default based on platform.
Nothing is masked: return a

Nothing to do, as dates don't have tz information
Nothing to update if the field doesn't have dimension fields or if the field is deferred.
Nothing to update if we have no file and not being forced to update.
Notice that evaluateExpression doesn't work with variable arguments.
Notice that in the data argument, each field's key has the prefix, in this case 'person1', prepended to the actual field name.
Notice that only one connection is specified, but the systems form a circuit since: (1) the lengths of the paths are justified and (2) the orientation and ordering of the flows is mirrored.
Notice that the colorbar command gets all the information it needs from the ContourSet object, CS3.
Notice that the explicit connections are handled automatically, but the implicit ones currently are not.

Nuclide can't open these remotely, so resolve them to the real path.
Nuclide server shall be able to find open port and upgrade it on the same port.
Null denotation - called in prefix context
Null is legal, so existing members of the set that are not in the assignment set are set to null.
Null/not null queries
NullBooleanField is a bit of a special case because its presentation (widget) is different than its data.
NullBooleanField needs special-case null-handling, so it comes before the general null test.
NullTranslations() has no _catalog
Nullable relationships can be ignored -- they are nulled out before deleting, and therefore do not affect the order in which objects have to be deleted.
NumPy bools can be used as boolean index (python ones as of yet not)
NumPy has no tp_traverse currently, so circular references cannot be detected.

Numerical differentiation: 2st order edges, 2nd order interior
Numpy 1.9.1 fixed a bug in masked arrays which resulted in additional elements being masked when calculating the gradient thus the output is different with earlier numpy versions.

Ordering by 'rank' gives us rank2, rank1, rank3.
Ordering by a many-valued attribute (e.g. a many-to-many or reverse ForeignKey) is legal, but the results might not make sense.
Ordering by model related to nullable relations should not change the join type of already existing joins.
Ordering by related tables should accommodate nullable fields (this test is a little tricky, since NULL ordering is database dependent.
Ordering by the Meta.ordering will be rank3, rank2, rank1.
Ordering columns must be included in the output columns.
Ordering fields are allowed to be left blank, and if they *are* left blank, they will be sorted below everything else.
Ordering might differ in collections
Ordering of extra() pieces is possible, too and you can mix extra fields and model fields in the ordering.
Ordering of points in the result of the union is not defined and implementation-dependent (DB backend, GEOS version)
Ordering of points in the resulting geometry may vary between implementations
Ordering on a related field should use the remote model's default ordering as a final step.
Ordering on related tables should be possible, even if the table is not otherwise involved.
Ordering requests are ignored
Ordering should not include any database column more than once (this is most likely to occur naturally with model inheritance, so we check it here).
Ordering should work with blank fieldsets.
Ordering uses the 'rhs' ordering, unless it has none, in which case the current ordering is used.
Ordinarily this will not be needed, since the axes object should already have hold set.

Otherwise, we must have llvm tools with the same suffix as `clang` or `clang++`
Otherwise, we need to introspect the object's relationships for a relation to the Site object
Otherwise, we receive an error the first time we attempt to use the requested client.
Otherwise, we try to remove spaces from the right side, if this doesn't work we try on left side but only if there's a non-character on the right.
Otherwise, we'll end up starting the animation.
Otherwise, we'll need to go to the database to look for an object whose date_field is at least (greater than/less than) the given naive result
Otherwise, you may be opening yourself up to a security risk.

Python 2 HACK: The following is the correct parse_qs implementation from cpython 3's stdlib.
Python 2 Python 2 will choke in urlencode on mixture of byte and unicode strings.
Python 2 compatibility
Python 2 crashes on non-ASCII strings.
Python 2 has reload as a builtin Ignoring python3.0-3.3 (those have imp.reload if we decide we care)
Python 2 lacks 'yield from', which could replace the inner loop
Python 2 lies about mode of sys.stderr
Python 2 memcache requires the key to be a byte string.
Python 2 reads bytes from the console output, use bytes for the StringIO
Python 2 will choke on next HTTP request in row if there are non-ASCII characters in Set-Cookie HTTP header of last response (see https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/issues/6769).
Python 2's version is apparently broken (see https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/pull/6244)
Python 2's version is apparently totally broken
Python 2.3 distutils new features

Python 2.6 Replace the msvcr func to return an empty list
Python 2.6 doesn't implement complex.__format__
Python 2.6 doesn't support package execution
Python 2.6 is brain-dead when it comes to fragments
Python 2.6 on SLES11 SP1 (https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/issues/3326)
Python 2.6.1 and below don't parse ws or wss urls properly.
Python 2.6.x shlex doesn't handle unicode type so we have to convert args to byte string for that case.
Python 2.7 / numpy 1.6 apparently require this to return builtin floats, not numpy floats.
Python 2.7 Note: Could use the pypi mock library on python3.x as well as python2.x.
Python 2/fallback version
Python 3 adds quotes around module name
Python 3 allows non-ASCII identifiers
Python 3 has a Unicode API
Python 3 has str.isidentifier() to check if a char is a valid identifier
Python 3 importlib caches os.listdir() on some platforms like Mac OS X (#23850).
Python 3 is a lot easier, and only uses this branch if it's not local.
Python 3 running in debug mode raises a ResourceWarning when file closing is left to the garbage collector, so we catch the warnings.
Python 3 typehinted params have multiple Name nodes.
Python 3, we already have raw_input
Python 3.3 uses a flexible string representation
Python 3.4 appears to clear any pre-existing warnings of the same type, when raising warnings inside a catch_warnings block.
Python 3.5 collapses nested partials, so can change "while" to "if" when it's the minimum supported version.
Python compiled with two byte unicode can lead to truncation if itemsize is not properly adjusted for NumPy's four byte unicode.

QuerySet with an __init__() method that takes an additional argument.
QuerySets can be used too.
Querying USER_SDO_GEOM_METADATA to get the SRID and dimension information.
Querying across m2m field should not strip the m2m table from join.

SNI Handling needs python2.7.9's SSLContext
SO is deprecated in 3.3.1, use EXT_SUFFIX instead
SPECIAL_KEYS are keys that do *not* return their unicode name instead they have manually specified names
SPLIT SALT, DIGEST, AND DATA
SQL annotation-related attributes The _annotations will be an OrderedDict when used.
SQL generated below works for SQLite databases because constraints don't exist
SQL-related attributes Select and related select clauses are expressions to use in the SELECT clause of the query.
SQL92 requires delimited (quoted) names to be case-sensitive.
SQL_AUTO_IS_NULL controls whether an AUTO_INCREMENT column on a recently inserted row will return when the field is tested for NULL.
SQLite also doesn't error properly
SQLite always runs at the SERIALIZABLE isolation level.
SQLite cannot handle us only partially reading from a cursor's result set and then writing the same rows to the database in another cursor.
SQLite doesn't actually give a name to the PK constraint, so we invent one.
SQLite doesn't actually support most of these types, but it "does the right thing" given more verbose field definitions, so leave them as is so that schema inspection is more useful.
SQLite doesn't enforce any integer constraints
SQLite doesn't have a power function, so we fake it with a user-defined function django_power that's registered in connect().
SQLite doesn't really have enforced references, but since it echoes out the SQL used to create the table we can look for REFERENCES statements used there.
SQLite doesn't support any index type other than b-tree
SQLite doesn't support tz-aware datetimes
SQLite had a problem with more than 500 UNIONed selects in single query.
SQLite has a different format for field_type
SQLite lets objects be saved with an empty primary key, even though an integer is expected.
SQLite requires LIKE statements to include an ESCAPE clause if the value being escaped has a percent or underscore in it.
SQLite returns buffer/memoryview, cast to bytes for checking.
SQLite/SpatiaLite in-memory databases
SRID auto-set from None
SRID of given geometry.
SSH to vzhost and get the list of guests in json
STDERR not captured to make it easier for users to prompt for input in their scripts
STDIN should be redirected too.
STIX sans isn't really its own fonts, just different code points in the STIX fonts, so we have to detect this one separately.
ST_Length_Spheroid Z-aware, and thus does not need to use a separate function internally.
ST_Within not available.

Similar thing is done in is_nullable(), too.
Similar to GitHub issue #387
Similar to a regular Form class you can define custom media to be used on the ModelForm.
Similar to the above, we only trigger if both sides are missing spaces to avoid false positives with shifts.
Similarly for select_related(), joins beyond an initial nullable join must use outer joins so that all results are included.
Similarly, *dx* and *dy* are assumed to be in the same units as your input z-values.
Similarly, changes to field attributes do not persist from one Form instance to the next.
Similarly, choices do not persist from one Form instance to the next.
Similarly, if it's not a string, it's not vault data

Simple tests for multiple GenericForeignKeys only uses one model, since the above tests should be sufficient.
Simple, 1d test: stacking 2 constant-padded neigh iterators
SimpleHTTPRequestHandler.send_head() expects us to preserve the distinction between paths with and without a trailing slash, but posixpath.normpath() discards that distinction.
SimpleTestCase can be decorated by override_settings, but not ut.TestCase
Simply checking self.model._meta.proxy would not identify that case as involving multiple tables.
Simply clear the registry, this should normally be harmless, note that on new pythons it would be invalidated anyway.
Simply removing data from form fields isn't the proper way to delete it.

Since I could find no way to make foreach work with spaces in filenames correctly, the .d files have spaces replaced with another character.
Since Python's sqlite3 module doesn't expose the get_limit() C API, assume the default limits are in effect and split the work in batches if needed.
Since Student does not subclass CommonInfo's Meta, it has the effect of completely overriding it.
Since TransformWrappers are mutable, use of equality here would be wrong.

Since ``my_doodad.alters_data`` is True, the template system will not try to call our doodad but will use string_if_invalid
Since ``my_doodad.do_not_call_in_templates`` is True, the template system will not try to call our doodad.
Since after every output the stream is reset automatically we don't need this.
Since both templates and all four contexts represent the same thing, they all render the same (and are returned as unicode objects and "safe" objects as well, for auto-escaping purposes).
Since environment variables can refer to other variables, the evaluation order is important.
Since formats may be filtered during format selection and may not match the original formats the results may be incorrect.
Since gyp doesn't support specify link_settings for each configuration, we are not able to link to different libraries in  "Debug" and "Release" configurations.

Since mapping might mix column names and default values, its values must be already quoted.
Since no axes were specified, should have allocated a scalar
Since no itemsize was specified, convert the input array to a list so the ndarray constructor will automatically determine the itemsize for us.
Since no pipes to read from are left, there is no need to call select() again.
Since obj3 is a subclass, it should have precedence, like CPython would give, even though obj2 has __numpy_ufunc__ and __radd__.
Since our Solaris code doesn't depend on LooseVersion, do not import it on Solaris.
Since prefetching can re-use instances, it is possible to have the same instance multiple times in obj_list, so obj might already be prepared.
Since rec.array converts dtype to a numpy.record for us, convert back to non-record before printing
Since some toolsets might have been defined conditionally, perform a second round of toolsets expansion now.

Since tests are distributed across processes on a per-TestCase basis, there's no need for more processes than TestCases.
Since tests will be wrapped in a transaction, or serialized if they are not available, we allow queries to be run.
Since the CLT has no SDK paths anyway, returning None is the most sensible route and should still do the right thing.

Since the canvas won't usually have the focus, bind the event to the window containing the canvas instead.
Since the connection is already closed, this crashes on some backends.
Since the default themes are not optimized for small screen space, using the same theme for HTML and epub output is usually not wise.
Since the default value for FileField subclasses is an instance of field.attr_class, previous_file will only be None when we are called from Model.__init__().
Since the input will have at least one ":" present before the password we can tell some things about the beginning and end of the data, though:
Since the list is guaranteed not to contain dicts, this won't do anything with conditions sections.
Since the parent and child are linked by an automatically created OneToOneField, you can get from the parent to the child by using the child's name.
Since the real purpose of the exempt decorator is to suppress the middleware's functionality, let's make sure it actually works...
Since the remainder of this function assumes that we're dealing with a package (module with a __path__), so if it's not, then bail here.
Since the results are sorted, binary search to find the range that matches.
Since the subarray is always in C-order, a transpose does not swap the subarray:

Since this isn't using FOR UPDATE, it won't block.
Since this method is called when models are imported, it cannot perform imports because of the risk of import loops.
Since this module gets imported in the application's root package, it cannot import models from other applications at the module level, and django.contrib.admin.forms eventually imports User.
Since this module gets imported in the application's root package, it cannot import models from other applications at the module level, and django.contrib.contenttypes.views imports ContentType.
Since this module gets imported in the application's root package, it cannot import models from other applications at the module level.
Since this overrides the inherited ModelChoiceField.clean we run custom validators here
Since this should only happen at compile time, that's probably OK.
Since this subplot will overlap the first, the plot (and its axes) previously created, will be removed
Since those three dicts key on the class_name and neither regular modules nor powershell modules would have class_names, they would not work as written.
Since we add a nicely formatted traceback on our own, create a copy of the log record without the exception data.
Since we already have all of the data for the host, update the host details as well The old way was ksmeta only -- provide backwards compatibility

Since we didn't run a NOT NULL change before we need to do it now
Since we disabled constraint checks, we must manually check for any invalid keys that might have been added
Since we displayed every form as blank, we will also accept them back as blank.
Since we have done something akin to a view from original_array, we should let the subclass finalize (if it has it implemented, i.e., is not None).
Since we just bypassed this class' get_queryset(), we must manage the reverse relation manually.
Since we know nothing about the call location of the sys.path, it's a possibility that the current directory is the origin of the Python execution.
Since we only inherit from `list` for `isinstance` backward compatibility (Refs #17413) we nullify this iterator as it would otherwise result in duplicate entries.
Since we want the docstr output to be always unicode, just force it.
Since we want to use the "safe" serializer for better interoperability, we need to do something with those pesky times.
Since we're adding 0s to x1, the result should be exactly the same as the broadcasted view of x1.
Since we're going to assign directly in the cache, we must manage the reverse relation cache manually.
Since we're in a forked process, our best chance to communicate with them is to print to stdout.
Since we're not providing a request object, we must provide a domain_override to prevent the save operation from failing in the potential case where contrib.sites is not installed.
Since we're not using this particular frequency, set the corresponding by_ to None so the rrule can act as appropriate
Since we're using the PlayIterator to carry forward failed hosts, in the event that a previous host was not in the current inventory we create a stub state for it now
Since we're using the console-based backend as a base, force the stream to be None, so we don't default to stdout
Since we've just deleted all the rows, running our sequence ALTER code will reset the sequence to 0.
Since when formatting the error the request handler might access self.POST, set self._post and self._file to prevent attempts to parse POST data again.

Sleep for `poll_interval` seconds if nor of the conditions apply:
Sleep for a little while.
Slice a chunk from the edge to calculate stats on
Slice support in Jedi is very marginal, at the moment, so just ignore them in case of __getitem__.
Slicing (example of new-from-template)
Slicing an array never generates internal overlap
Slicing with ellipsis always results in an array, not a scalar
Slicing with ellipsis can skip an arbitrary number of dimensions
Slightly less efficient as all processes with unexpected module names will wait on this lock
Slightly more advanced, we hid all of the password despite the ":"
Slow, but safe for subclasses of ndarray
Slower, kwargs-ready version.
Slugs are empty to start with.
Small check that data in array element is ok
Small file posting should work.

Snip out an extra 'lib' from libs if appropriate.
So I decided to implement a suggested change and consider the file completely downloaded if the file size differs less than 100 bytes from the one in the hard drive.
So add it to the name.
So assert_warns will have to be sufficient.
So can "inputs" and "outputs" sections of "actions" groups.
So depending on the current value of the field we have to dynamically construct some sort of "thing" to return.
So do as other gyp generators and use --start-group and --end-group.
So does a custom session with an idle expiration time of 0 (but it'll expire at browser close)
So don't error out in this case.
So far only the first token in command is assigned to command field.
So for now, we will allow it, unless the 'allow_sharedlib_linksettings_propagation' flag is explicitly set to False.
So for versions below, we use a "best guess".
So if the first iter throws it, the second is *not* consumed.
So if the user is able to remove the file before your postprocessor runs it might cause a few problems.
So if we are saving a JPEG, convert the wx.Bitmap to a wx.Image, and set the quality.
So instead of using the iterable(v) function we simply try and convert to a tuple, and proceed if not.
So instead, we define our own __reduce__ method and custom unpickler.
So it should not be necessary to test all.
So it will catch when images end up in the wrong place in case of non-standard dpi setting.
So it's better to keep provided format_id intact.
So just parse the next part.
So just use the keyword ``repl`` for now.
So l1 is a Line2D instance, not a sequence of lines
So let's 'break' or 'cut-out' the y-axis into two portions - use the top (ax) for the outliers, and the bottom (ax2) for the details of the majority of our data
So long as we support versions 1.6.x and less, we need the following local version of putmask.
So next should be in the future
So next should be in the future (yup, #7164, again)
So no need to do anything here
So ordering by name doesn't take place for Students.
So polygons will not support post hoc conversions of the unit type since they are not storing the orig data.
So print a warning if we find any
So put it in LOCAL_CFLAGS.
So test various different code paths.
So that the image is aligned with the edge of the axes, we want to round up the output width to the next integer.
So the "kw" dictionary is thrown out, and only its 'color' value is kept and translated as a 'facecolor'.
So the MITM can circumvent the CSRF protection.
So the amount of red (or green or blue for that matter since white and black blend to a grayscale) is the alpha intensity.
So the default query has to be adapted to include raster indices.
So things that are directly related to the core of ansible are in terms of that sort of connection that always originate on the controller.
So this is a hack to say: if you are not "plot", which is creating Line2D, then convert the data now to floats.
So this is not important to be correct.
So use some new local ones and set them to the already computed values.
So we are special-casing this.
So we can check on save Now do any initial draw
So we can't check for an error being raised in that case for SQLite.
So we can't use os.path.dirname(__file__), as that will find whichever versioneer.py was first imported, even in later projects.
So we cannot store this in remote_tmpdir (use system tempdir instead)
So we check if the user set REMOTE_TMP to somewhere in or below /var/tmp and if so use /var/tmp.
So we don't need to do anything complicated for copying.
So we extract the ordered list and check the length.
So we first put the gzipped string of the test reference array, write it to a securely opened file, which is then read from by the loadtxt function
So we first try on the class, in order to get the descriptor object.
So we give people a config option to affect display of the args so that they can secure this if they feel that their stdout is insecure (shoulder surfing, logging stdout straight to a file, etc).
So we have to split the exclude filter in the middle and then optimize the inner query without losing results.
So we impose the numbering from masked ancestors first, then overwrite it with unmasked ancestor numbers.
So we need some book keeping to ensure we don't do duplicate work.
So we need to know exactly what kind of error it raises when there is an attempt to read more than the available bytes:
So we need to produce 2n backslashes.
So we need to produce 2n+1 backslashes.
So we need to remove the filter temporarily.
So we need to reset the details of the FieldFile in those cases.
So we need to try to create the file, but if it already exists we have to go back to get_available_name() and try again.
So we punt on finding that out.
So we roll our own RFC-compliant parsing.
So we substitute in 2* what we match, +1 more, plus the quote.
So we try for a (large) number of times and then raise an exception.
So we use the previously assigned _last_failed_start_pos variable to account for that.
So what we do is extract the alpha information from the red channel, which is a blend of the default dvipng background (white) and foreground (black).
So, 'U0."id"' is referenced twice.
So, again a1 match, a2 not.
So, any existing inner join forces the join type to remain inner.
So, first do a call to an API method to force cleanup.
So, if it isn't, add a vertex here grab the paths from the collections
So, if we are already on an automatically added lookup, don't add the new lookups from relationships we've seen already.
So, in effect we are testing that we are promoting the fk_rel join to a left outer join here.
So, instead of doing...
So, it is essential that the pk numberings do not match.
So, it is safe to use INNER join.
So, it would better to move this function as a method with some refactoring of _get_layout method.
So, make sure at least one field is selected.
So, now the a__f1 join doesn't need promotion.
So, object files are created to the current directory and then moved to build directory
So, once we drop 2.4 support, maybe...
So, per the docs, we reassign the list so the proxy picks up and notifies all other threads
So, run only on psycopg2 for that reason.
So, the Container class moves SomeModel outside of module level
So, the from_field is object_id field, to_field is pk because of the reverse join.
So, the mask of a field is no longer set to nomask...
So, there is a warning generated by the tests within the context manager, but no previous warnings.
So, unusually, it doesn't make sense to run the tests individually, and if any are failing it is confusing to run them with any other set of tests.
So, use instance.pk (that is, parent_ptr_id) when asked for instance.id.
So, version_cmd needs more work.
So, we catch all, with the idea that one would rather potentially lose a tick from one side of the axis or another, rather than see a stack trace.
So, we decrease the zorder a bit to prevent this.
So, we have both an INNER and a LEFT join in the query.
So, we know that it is an array with first dimension the same as xs.
So, we need to add cols in select, order_by, and having into the select in any case.
So, we need to promote any existing INNER to LOUTER (it is possible this promotion in turn will be demoted later on).
So, we remove them from the PATH using the ANDROID_BUILD_PATHS variable set by envsetup.
So, you have been warned..

That doesn't cover everything MANIFEST.in can do (http://docs.python.org/2/distutils/sourcedist.html#commands), so it might give some false negatives.
That ensures that earlier replacements won't mess up the string in a way that causes later calls to find the earlier substituted text instead of what's intended for replacement.
That file may load the system-wide install of ansible rather than the one in the module.
That is how inlines are rendered and #9498 will bubble up if it is an issue.
That is unfortunate, as some of these functions are not intended to work with masked arrays.
That is, avoid trimming joins generated for F() expressions.
That is, it doesn't merge the trees.
That is, sequence of actions would be:
That isn't Django's problem.
That list is stored here.
That means that things need to be prepended to excluded_list to maintain them in the same order that they existed in the_list.
That means this has two tasks:
That means we have to handle -emit-bc and -c actions.
That missing table should cause detect_soft_applied() to return False.
That module has a much better description of what's going on and why.
That should not affect records of another database
That should not happen here.
That way users will see the comments with some nice usage instructions
That won't stop people trying to do this, so let's be explicit.
That would be considered invalid anyway.
That would let us make this code better (remove a single newline if preserve_trailing_newlines is False).
That would prepend the new items to the list in reverse order, which would be an unwelcome surprise.
That's OK, because you can create TaggedItems explicitly.
That's all she wrote...
That's around 2600 single precision samples.
That's for the playbook to decide.
That's not what we want, we want a module, so we add it here:
That's probably fine.
That's the risk you shoulder if using cache backing.
That's why the double () below.
That's why there's no "else" branch here.
The "-K shared" switches are being left in for pre-9.0 versions of Absoft though I don't think versions earlier than 9 can actually be used to build shared libraries.
The "-m" argument can be omitted, in which case the script will collect all of the frameworks in the named SDK(s) and dump their APIs.
The ".dev0" means dirty.
The "Add" button inside the object-tools shouldn't appear.
The "__exact" lookup type can be omitted, as a shortcut.

The "target" property accepts an XCTarget object, and obviously not NoneType.
The "whatever/" list is no longer needed, dump it.
The # is part of the first name and should be deleted automatically.
The ' in the onClick attributes are not escaped, it couldn't be parsed like: http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/wb/gravity/

The 'context' parameter must be present when takes_context is True
The 'encoding' value for pickle also affects what encoding the serialized binary data of NumPy arrays is loaded in.
The 'initial' parameter is meaningless if you pass data.
The 'lib' and 'include' variables may be overwritten by MSVCCompiler.initialize, so save them for later merge.
The 'meta' field is not always in the video webpage, we request it from another page
The 'seen_models' is used to optimize checking the needed parent alias for a given field.
The 'select' argument to extra() supports names with dashes in them, as long as you use values().
The 'sqlite3' backend requires only the ENGINE setting (an in- memory database will be used).
The 'supports_binary' message is on a client-by-client basis.
The 'supports_binary' message is relevant to the websocket itself.
The 'target_build_files' key is only set when loading target build files in the non-parallel code path, where LoadTargetBuildFile is called recursively.
The 'values to be matched' must be hashable as they will be used in a dictionary.
The 'widget' parameter to a Field can also be an instance:
The (c) is deprecated, but tolerate it until it's removed from all files.

The *zero_nine_capt_args captures an extra argument.
The .d checking code below uses these functions: wildcard, sort, foreach, shell, wordlist wildcard can handle spaces, the rest can't.
The 0.5 factor reflects the fact that we plot from v-p to v+p
The 1/10 scaling factor accommodates the absolute tolerance used in assert_almost_equal.
The 1d case is handled separately because we need more values in this case.
The 2-byte characters are used as XObjects, so they need extra info in their dictionary
The 5 minute (300 seconds) default expiration time for keys is defined in the implementation of the initializer method of the BaseCache type.
The 8BUI stores both the PostGIS pixel data type and a nodata flag.
The ::1.2.3.4 format used to be valid but was deprecated in rfc4291 section 2.5.5.1

The Developer folder moved in Xcode 4.3.
The Dummy cache backend doesn't really behave like a test backend, so it has its own test case.
The Evaluator.goto function checks for definitions, but since we use a reverse tokenizer, we have new name_part objects, so we have to check the user_stmt here for positions.
The ExtendsNode has to be the first non-text node.
The Fbx SDK defaults mesh.Color to (0.8, 0.8, 0.8) This causes most models to receive incorrect vertex colors
The File deletion should have cascaded and deleted *all* references to it.
The ForeignKey itself doesn't have validation for non-integers, so we must run validation using the target field.
The Fortran index should be correct with any reordering
The FutureWarning was given once, the filtered warnings were
The GDAL band-io works with ctypes arrays to hold data to be written or to hold the space for data to be read into.

The ImageField.update_dimension_fields method hooked up to the post_init signal handles the Model.__init__() cases.
The JavaScript code looks for this hook.
The LLVM Compiler Infrastructure
The LogEntry.user column isn't altered to a UUID type so it's set to an integer manually in CustomUserAdmin to avoid an error.
The Mac linker doesn't work that way, but other platforms do, and so their linker invocations need to be constructed in this way.

The Z values are defined at the center of each image pixel (each color block on the following subplot), so the domain that is contoured does not extend beyond these pixel centers.
The __call__ method is a thin wrapper around the transmute method and take care of the aspect.
The __null extension is typically only used by system headers, which define NULL as __null in C++ rather than using 0 (which is an integer that may not match the size of a pointer).

The auth/user/change_password.html template uses super in the bodyclass block.
The authority value for the units
The auto_creation_counter is used for fields that Django implicitly creates, creation_counter is used for all user-specified fields.
The autogenerated `db_table` will be bar_foos.
The automatically joined table has a predictable name.
The axes module contains all the wrappers to plotting functions.
The b is a special case because it is used for reconstructing.
The backend "mostly works" without this function and there are use cases for compiling Python without the sqlite3 libraries (e.g. security hardening).
The bars aren't wide enough to print the ranking inside
The base case for recursion is defined at PBXProject.PBXProjectAncestor.
The base command is python.
The base dir for Django is one level above the test dir.
The base dir for Django's tests is one level up.
The base_fields class attribute is the *class-wide* definition of fields.
The baseline images are created in this locale, so we should use it during all of the tests.
The basename for the epub file.
The basic problem here is that we're "rotating" two separate objects but want it to appear as if they're rotated together.
The basic scheme is always the same: 3 models with 2 relations.
The below doesn't make sense...
The below make code says, only load the .mk file if the .mk filename doesn't start with a token in NO_LOAD.
The bin_edges are the same for all of the histograms
The bitwidth of data depends on the application of the trie.
The book object should have two.
The book should have one author.
The book should have two authors now.
The boolean array has illegal indexes, but this is allowed if the broadcast fancy-indices are 0-sized.
The bounds must be monotonically increasing.
The buffer is created as type uint32 so that entire pixels can be compared in one numpy call, rather than needing to compare each plane separately.
The bug does not occur here because a Book with pubdate of Sep 1 exists
The bug in #9023: if you access the one-to-one relation *before* setting to None and deleting, the cascade happens anyway.
The bug is that the following queries would raise: "TypeError: Related Field has invalid lookup: gte"
The bug only occured when output argument of einssum was used.
The built host binaries may not be suitable, and can cause errors.
The builtin filter group exists
The builtin tag group exists
The builtins module is special and always cached.
The bulk of the output from fc-list is ascii, so we keep the result in bytes and parse it as bytes, until we extract the filename, which is in sys.filesystemencoding().
The bytes encoding is available starting from Python 3.4
The cache can be emptied using clear
The cache can be inspected for cache keys
The cache is cleaned when .connect() or .disconnect() is called and populated on send().
The cache key contains the command to be run as well as the directory to run it from, to account for commands that depend on their current directory.
The calc_label_rot_and_inline routine requires that (xmin,ymin) be a vertex in the path.
The calculated bounds are approximately the bounds of the original data, this is because the entire path is taken into account when updating the datalim.
The calculation of these parameters is a substantial component of numpy's import time.
The callback has one parameter, which is the child to be removed.
The caller is interested in the variant group, not the specific variant file.
The caller should ensure that they don't receive an invalid value like None.
The candidate relations are the ones that come from N-1 and 1-1 relations.
The case in the bug report.
The center also shall be eliminated by get_flat_tri_mask.
The center points are also the same (but in different coordinate systems), and this time they actually correspond to the centroid of the border.
The centroid is a Point, create a geometry for this.
The chain of redirects stops once the cycle is detected.
The chain of redirects will get back to the starting point, but stop there.
The challenge for coders is remembering which leg of the trip is associated with the conditions that you're checking at any one time.
The cheap and easy case.
The check for windows is needed because has_cblas uses the same compiler that was used to compile Python and msvc is often not installed when mingw is being used.
The check needs to be done at this stage because join promotion can't be done at compiler stage.
The checks for if y is x are so that we can use the same function to implement the core of psd(), csd(), and spectrogram() without doing extra calculations.
The checksum algorithm must match with the algorithm in ShellModule.checksum() method
The checksums don't match and we will change or error out.
The child may not be unpickled yet, so restore its information.
The child nodes of this list The following parameters are set in the vpack and hpack functions
The child was relative to its parent.
The children inherit the Meta class of their parents (if they don't specify their own).
The children of the main group ("Source", "Products", etc.) is pretty much the only case where this likely to come up.
The circular doubly linked list starts and ends with a sentinel element.
The city shapefile is 2D, and won't be able to fill the coordinates in the 3D model -- thus, a LayerMapError is raised.
The class may have been declared with namespace or classname qualifiers.
The class to wrap instance attributes in.
The class we'll use for the test client self.client.
The class would need to overwrite trace to ensure single-element output also has the right subclass.
The cleaned geometry should be transformed to 32140.
The client SHOULD NOT attempt to match a presented identifier in which the wildcard character comprises a label other than the left-most label.
The client SHOULD NOT attempt to match a presented identifier where the wildcard character is embedded within an A-label or U-label of an internationalized domain name.
The client requests notification of what the current image mode is.
The clip path can only be widened by popping from the state stack.
The code below generates a separate .mk file for each target, but all are sourced by the top-level GypAndroid.mk.
The code below generates a separate .mk file for each target, but all are sourced by the top-level Makefile.
The code below will create a new empty instance of class self.__class__, then update its dict with self.__dict__ values - so, this is very close to normal pickle.
The code has a special case for posix systems, so if we are on posix test both that the special case works and that the generic code works.
The code here normally doesn't run.
The code point value is split as follows:
The code to mark the form field as not required is used by form_for_instance, but can probably be removed once form_for_instance is gone.
The codenames and ctypes that should exist.
The codes will be all "LINETO" commands, except for "MOVETO"s at the beginning of each subpath
The collectstatic test suite already has conflicting files since both project/test/file.txt and apps/test/static/test/file.txt are collected.
The color array can include masked values:
The colorbar is also based on this master image.
The colorization mode is global because so is sys.stdout.
The colors may come in as numpy arrays, which aren't hashable
The column array must return column names in the same order in which they were created.
The columns of U are the eigenvectors of a a.H.
The comm is ascii, so we always send the image in base64 encoded data URL form.
The comparison is done with a very low tolerance.
The comparison result cannot be interpreted as a bool
The comparison should be weak, so look for a match after stripping off any weak indicators.
The comparisons are flagged by pep8, ignore that.
The complete data transformation stack -- from data all the way to display coordinates
The complex types raise different exceptions
The condition added here will be SQL like this: NOT (col IS NOT NULL), where the first NOT is added in upper layers of code.
The condition below is in case of using --local on a file already in the current workind directory.
The condition variable used to protect this object and notify the main loop when there might be more data to process.
The connection is closed and the transaction is marked as needing rollback.
The connection is created by running ssh/scp/sftp from the exec_command, put_file, and fetch_file methods, so we don't need to do any connection management here.
The connection is usable again .
The construction leaves the array with duplicate points, which are removed here.
The constructor and destructor will not have those qualifiers.
The content of ifchanged template tag was rendered twice.
The contents are a black box - assume no aggregates are used.
The contents are more or less appended verbatim to the appropriate clause.
The contents describe the relation in Model terms (model Options and Fields for both sides of the relation.
The contents of `OPTIONS` was formerly only used to set the behaviors attribute, but is now passed directly to the Client constructor.
The contents of this file are pickled, so don't put values in the namespace that aren't picklable (module imports are okay, they're removed automatically).
The contents of this file are pickled, so don't put values in the namespace that aren't pickleable (module imports are okay, they're removed automatically).
The context is known to be unpicklable (e.g., a function).
The conversion done below works both in 2 and 3.
The converter takes an FBX file as an argument.
The cookie backend doesn't handle non-default expiry dates, see #19201
The coordinates of each city, with Z values corresponding to their altitude in meters.
The copy may be required for multithreading.
The correct level gets the message.
The corresponding nested array description:
The count() function respects distinct() as well.
The county helper is called to ensure integrity of County models.
The credentials supplied are invalid to all backends, fire signal
The current "image" (ScalarMappable) is retrieved or set only via the pyplot interface using the following two functions:
The current class is now visited, so remove it from list
The current field is not part of the key: add the suffixes
The current field is part of the key: take the largest dtype
The current implementation of the parallel test runner requires multiprocessing to start subprocesses with fork().
The current implementation removes contours completely covered by labels.
The current rule is: We only clear spaces from both sides when we're at the end of the line.
The current state always exists in the top element of the stack.
The cursor is on a class/function name.
The cursor referenced by the type of size is the typedef for size_type.
The custom User uses email as the unique identifier, and requires that every user provide a date of birth.
The custom queryset filters should be applied to the queryset instance returned by the manager.
The cwd is the current build directory.
The cygwin case handles this inside the bash sub-shell.
The dash tuple is (offset, onoffseq) where onoffseq is an even length tuple of on and off ink in points.
The data are pollution source profile estimates for five modeled pollution sources (e.g., cars, wood-burning, etc) that emit 7-9 chemical species.
The data does not disappear because it has been iterated.
The data is floating point, but the values are small integers, so assert_array_equal *should* be safe here (rather than, say, assert_array_almost_equal).
The data is ignored, but let's check it doesn't crash the system anyway.
The data source driver is a void pointer.
The database backend wasn't found.
The database could not be loaded
The database default should be removed.
The database will perform a rollback by itself.
The datetime module doesn't restrict the output of tzname().
The debugger prints the path given on the command line, which is often relative.
The decorators applied to the methods are applied before the ones applied to the class.
The default Python int type should work
The default behavior for string indexing.
The default database has lost the book.
The default exec user is root, unless it was changed in the Dockerfile with USER
The default file storage backend used during the build process
The default from the new field is used in updating existing rows.
The default implementation of this method looks at the backend-specific data_types dictionary, looking up the field by its "internal type".
The default is a simple extent check
The default is instance method, and methodTypeCharacter may not actually be '-'.
The default is to use the SMTP backend.
The default manager is used in migrations
The default map settings that may be overloaded -- still subject to API changes.
The default state of the category filter.
The default translation is based on the settings file.
The default user-agent with foxgay cookies leads to pages without videos
The default value is None
The default value of 3 is generated for the case expression.
The default_alias property may raise a TypeError, so we use a try/except construct rather than hasattr in order to remain consistent between PY2 and PY3 (hasattr would swallow the TypeError on PY2).
The definition of "sign" here is different from np.sign: we never want to get 0.0
The definition of PBXTargetDependency can't be moved below XCTarget because XCTarget's own schema references PBXTargetDependency.
The delete is actually 2 queries - one to find related objects, and one to delete.
The dependency sorting should not result in an error, and the through model should have dependencies to the other models and as such come last in the list.
The dependent one or more dependencies not in flat_list.
The depfile may not exist if the input file didn't have any #includes.
The depth of the table of contents in toc.ncx.
The derived classes are required to be able to be initialized w/o arguments, i.e., all its argument (except self) must have the default values.
The descent needs to be adjusted for the angle
The description should be similar to Py objects.
The descriptor to use for accessing the attribute off of the class.
The deserialization process needs to run in a transaction in order to test forward reference handling.
The dest is a directory.
The developer is responsible for making sure they have a valid value.
The developer may be adding these values to the model after form validation.
The dictionary values are tuples, to account for aliases in variable names.
The different databases that Django supports behave differently in certain situations, so it is recommended to run the test suite against as many database backends as possible.
The different modes test different nditer functionality with or without GIL.
The dimensions here give a good aspect ratio
The dir function can be wrong.
The directory and main part of the URL
The directory must exist and be writable.
The directory where this setting is pointing should contain subdirectories named as the locales, containing a formats.py file (i.e. "myproject.locale" for myproject/locale/en/formats.py etc.
The distance/hash is unconditional.
The distutils module is not shipped with SUNWPython on Solaris.
The domain is divided into three sections, only some of which may actually be present.
The downside of this in the impl below is that enter could be repeatedly triggered if thes  mouse is over the axes and one is resizing with the keyboard.
The dtype is float64, but the isbuiltin attribute is 0.
The edge cases of the IPv6 validation code are not deeply tested here, they are covered in the tests for django.utils.ipv6
The edit made by User1 does not get applied to object "Foo" but instead is used to create a new object (bug).
The editor instance should have a db state
The effective_connector is used so that NOT (a AND b) is treated similarly to (a OR b) for join promotion.
The element from the active wavefront will be masked if their circle ratio is bad.
The email backend to use.
The empty forms should be equal.
The empty list is not cast to string, as this is only to document that fact (it likely should be changed).
The encoding for OGR data sources may be specified here (e.g., 'cp437' for Census Bureau boundary files).
The encoding is utf-8 without BOM (for future expansion).
The encoding of source files.
The encoding used in GET/POST dicts.
The entire nesting stack before #if
The entire nesting stack up to #else
The environment is saved as an "environment block" (see CreateProcess and msvs_emulation for details).
The error message depends on the backend
The errors should be available via the TranslationUnit's diagnostics.
The event source fires events that cause the frame sequence to be iterated.
The eviroment provided by auxfuncs.py is needed for some calls to eval.
The examples prefixed by 'mmltt' are from the MathML torture test here: http://www.mozilla.org/projects/mathml/demo/texvsmml.xhtml
The exception isn't created at initialization time for the sake of consistency with `ForwardManyToOneDescriptor`.
The exception raised on attribute access when a related object doesn't exist should be an instance of a subclass of `AttributeError` refs #21563
The exception type to catch from the underlying library for a key that was not found.
The exception was raised
The exception will be raised later in the child process started by the autoreloader.
The existence of an ETag means that there is "a current representation for the target resource", even if the ETag is weak, so there is a match to '*'.
The existence of an ETag means that there is "a current representation for the target resource", so there is a match to '*'.
The expected result is that channel is LOUTER joined, program INNER joined
The experimental fontconfig-based backend.
The extension is unknown until actual downloading
The extension user is a simple extension of the built-in user class, adding a required date_of_birth field.
The extensions use runtime_library_dirs
The extra argument also works when the formset is pre-filled with initial data.
The extra cast-to-int is only needed for python2
The extraction process is the same as for playlists, but the regex for the video ids doesn't contain an index
The facecolor of a spine is always 'none' by default -- let the user change it manually if desired.
The factorization is not unique and varies between libraries, so it is not possible to check against known values.
The failure case (bug #12049) on Python 2.4 with a LazyObject-wrapped User is a fatal TypeError: "function() takes at least 2 arguments (0 given)" deep inside deepcopy().
The feed dictionary to use for URLs.
The field is nullable in the database anyway, leave it alone
The field is the related field on the lhs side.
The field lives on a base class of the current model.
The field name the FK on the book model points to
The field now contains the new user
The field now contains the other selected band's id
The field now contains the selected band's id
The field now contains the two selected bands' ids
The field's _get_db_prep_lookup() is used to get any extra distance parameters.
The fields are added in the order in which the parent classes are listed.
The file consists of a preamble, some number of pages, a postamble, and a finale.
The file had already been fully downloaded.
The file input is left blank by the user to keep the existing, initial value.
The file's source and destination must be on the same filesystem.
The filenames should have been sanitized by the time it got to the view.
The files in this directory will be used to set up the initial environment for each test.
The files under src/ that are scanned for API functions
The first "src" component found will be treated as though it were the path used for --depth.
The first (num_largecol) columns will have (nrows+1) rows, and remaining (num_smallcol) columns will have (nrows) rows.
The first 2 entires in the tuple are (font, char, sizescale) for the two symbols under and over.
The first 2 parts (6 minutes) are available without login MD5 sums omitted as values are different on Travis CI and my machine

The first and last arguments can be 1-D
The first argument can be 1-D
The first block has a savepoint and must roll back.
The first buffer has no need for transformation SQL because it is the same SRID as what was given to `transform()`.

The first phase is generating all the operations for each app and gathering them into a big per-app list.
The first relation may be null, while the second is non-nullable.
The first save command is just to estimate the bounding box of the figure.
The first time autodiscover is called, we should get our real error.
The first two models represent a very simple null FK ordering case.
The first two numbers are the endianness and the PostGIS Raster Version, both are fixed by PostGIS at the moment.
The first two passwords are empty strings, but the second two are valid.
The first two passwords do not match, but the second two do match and are valid.
The fix is to check all the dimensions of the stride in question, which in the test case reveals that the stride is not fixed.

The following line removes the corresponding None parameter.
The following lists may be moved to a more accessible location.
The following makes it easier for us to script updates of the bundled code
The following methods are specific to FigureManagerWebAgg
The following methods cannot be implemented in __getattr__, because the code must run when the method is invoked, not just when it is accessed.
The following methods form the public API for storage systems, but with no default implementations.
The following methods represent a public interface to private methods.
The following packages and commands need to be included in the latex file's preamble:

The following two queries must be done in the same order as written, otherwise 'primary_house' will cause non-prefetched lookups
The following use-case is problematic, and to resolve its tricky side-effects requires more changes.
The following will be aware in UTC.
The font subsetting to a Type 3 font does not work for OpenType (.otf) that embed a Postscript CFF font, so avoid that -- save as a (non-subsetted) Type 42 font instead.
The force_escape filter assume unicode, make sure that works
The foreign key field might not be on the form, so we poke at the Model field to get the label, since we need that for error messages.
The form itself is valid, but no email is sent
The form should not validate fields that it doesn't contain even if they are specified using 'fields', not 'exclude'.
The form should still have an instance of a model that is not complete and not saved into a DB yet.
The form validation should fail because 'some_required_info' is not included on the parent form, and the family_name of the parent does not match that of the child
The format is a list of tuples containing the path and title.
The format of PkgInfo is eight characters, representing the bundle type and bundle signature, each four characters.
The format string can be lazy.
The forms layer doesn't escape input values directly because error messages might be presented in non-HTML contexts.
The formset is valid even though poem.pk + 1 doesn't exist, because it's marked for deletion anyway
The found starting point is likely a Join instead of a BaseTable reference.
The frame sequence represents information for each frame of the animation and depends on how the drawing is handled by the subclasses.
The full path of the source file
The full path of the target file
The full version, including alpha/beta/rc tags.
The fully transparent part should be red, not white or black or anything else
The function has the signature
The funky name reduces the chance of an accidental clash.
The gen 1 and gen 2 yaml strings
The general idea is to take a union of itags of both DASH manifests (for example video with such 'manifest behavior' see https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/issues/6093)
The generator flag 'xcode_serialize_all_test_runs' controls the forcing of all tests serially.
The generator is not passed to the 'for' loop, because it does a list(values) instead, call gen.next() in the template to control the generator.
The generators can provide more keys, the two lists are merged into path_sections, but you should call IsPathSection instead of using either list directly.
The geographic type of the field.
The geometry field of the model is set here.
The geometry is passed in as a parameter because we handled transformation conditions in this routine.
The geometry type must match that of the field -- unless the general GeometryField is used.
The get needs to be targeted at the write database in order to avoid potential transaction consistency problems
The get() needs to be targeted at the write database in order to avoid potential transaction consistency problems.
The glue setting of this list
The goal here is that the user can specify an output logical DPI for the image, but this will not actually add any extra pixels to the image, it will merely be used for metadata purposes.
The goal of the first two transformations is to get from the data space (in this case longitude and latitude) to axes space.
The goal of these transforms is to go from that space to display space.
The group_by attribute can have one of the following forms: - None: no group by at all in the query - A list of expressions: group by (at least) those expressions.
The guard should be PATH_FILE_H_, but we also allow PATH_FILE_H__ for backward compatibility.
The half-arrows contain the midpoint of the stem, which we can omit from the full arrow.
The hardcoded condition is a code smell but we can't rely on a flag on the command class because we haven't located it yet.
The harness chooses a number of iterations for each tests to achieve the best accuracy in the given time limit (in order to do that, it performs several auxiliary test runs).
The harness makes a separate test from each of these functions, runs all the tests and reports aggregate results.
The header is a pretty-printed string representation of a literal Python dictionary with trailing newlines padded to a 16-byte boundary.
The header must fit within one chunk.
The header to add to the top of the *_lite.c file.
The headers are intentionally repeated for easy copy/paste.
The headers phase should come before the resources, sources, and frameworks phases, if any.
The heading for the m2m inline block uses the right text
The help text is displayed whether or not data is provided for the form.
The hour locator takes the hour or sequence of hours you want to tick, not the base multiple
The id_for_label property of the subwidget should return the ID that is used on the subwidget's tag
The idea is that all these creations and saving should work without crashing.
The idea is that we scan once here and collect all the information we need to make future decisions.
The if-block can be removed after #7267 has been fixed.
The image is "pasted" onto a white background image to safely handle any transparency
The image will normally need to be rebuilt every time chrome's build dependancies are changed.
The implementation here is a bit odd (timezone.utc is an instance, not a class), but it simulates the correct conditions.
The implementation is similar to `datetime_trunc_sql` as both `DateTimeField` and `TimeField` are stored as TIMESTAMP where the date part of the later is ignored.
The implementation of last_executed_queries isn't optimal.
The implementations of these methods should perhaps be generalized.
The implicit make rules have it looking for RCS files, among other things.
The implicit tuple in statements.
The import .lib is the output of a build step, but because dependents only link against the lib (not both the lib and the dll) we keep track of the import library here.
The import path is hardcoded and should be the right place, so we are not expecting an ImportError.
The import path needs to be reduced by one, because we're completing.
The important thing to know here is that in axes coordinates, which are always between 0-1, spine endpoints are at these locations (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1).
The in operator can be used to inspect cache contents
The include line must include at least one item, which is the filename to include.
The include paths will be passed to the compiler in the order: numpy paths, --include-dirs paths, Python include path.
The include_state object keeps track of the highest type seen, and complains if we see a lower type after that.
The included_files entries are relative to the dir of the build file that included them, so we have to undo that and then make them relative to the root dir.
The incoming data is float, but the _renderer type-checking wants to see integers.
The index is a scalar.
The index on ForeignKey is replaced with a unique constraint for OneToOneField.
The individual parsers will raise an error if we feed them something they can't digest.
The individual targets need to be merged into the defaults.
The inherited dict provides __getitem__, __len__, __contains__, and get.
The inline argument to clabel will control whether the labels are draw over the line segments of the contour, removing the lines beneath the label
The inner CharField is missing a max_length.
The inner array is 0x0, the ufunc cannot handle this case
The input is the result of a gettext_lazy() call.
The input to these transforms are in axes space in x and display space in y.
The input to these transforms are in display space in x and axes space in y.
The instance dict contains whatever was originally assigned in __set__.
The instance doesn't have m2m data yet
The instance representation is set by model's __str__()
The intermediate m2m model is not auto created if: 1) There is a manually specified intermediate, or 2) The class owning the m2m field is abstract.
The internal self.__map dictionary maps keys to links in a doubly linked list.
The internal value is preserved if using HiddenInput (#7753).
The isvalid lookup doesn't make sense for rasters.
The items of the iterable may be expressions and therefore need to be resolved independently.
The iterator had an issue with buffering this reduction
The iterator should always find the iteration order with increasing memory addresses Test the ordering for 1-D to 5-D shapes
The join is direct and not nullable so we can use INNER JOIN for it.
The join table of the ManyToManyField goes to the model's tablespace, and its indexes too, unless DEFAULT_INDEX_TABLESPACE is set.
The join_field is the field backing the relation.
The joined path was located outside of this template_dir (it might be inside another one, so this isn't fatal).
The kernel uses the following, but it seems like it would have false positives, where one string reordered its arguments.
The key is the alias of the joined table (possibly the table name) and the value is a Join-like object (see sql.datastructures.Join for more information).
The key is the tool name, the value is a dictionary mapping setting names to conversion functions.
The key is the tool name, the value is a dictionary mapping setting names to validation functions.
The key name for these properties does not matter because the values are just items for a larger list.
The keys are strings.
The keys are the supported sites and the values are the name to be shown to the user and in the extractor description.
The keys must be PDF names, so if we find strings there, we make Name objects from them.
The keys should be property names and the values integers
The keyword argument has already been supplied once
The keyword arguments for model construction.
The kwarg was successfully extracted
The label may not start or end with a hyphen or an underscore.
The lambda function The tabular inline
The language for content autogenerated by Sphinx.
The language of the text.
The largest size of the radical symbol in STIX has incorrect metrics that cause it to be disconnected from the stem.
The last argument can be 1-D
The last bin includes the right edge.
The last foreign key should point to Group model.
The last line of a dependency list.
The last line of a project definition.
The last resort is to try direct unsigned hls/hds URLs from info dictionary.
The last segment looks like a path.
The last segment looks like an environment setting or cli argument.
The latter is then called by the former.
The ldflags config key is not used on mac or win.
The length does not match, we start the download over
The lengths of the paths and the trunks must be adjusted manually, and that is a bit tricky.
The library module classes fail if the stem is set.
The lightnening filter is copied from http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/filters.html I tested it with Inkscape and Firefox3.
The limit_choices_to on the parent field says that a parent object's number attribute must be 10, so this should fail validation.
The line between the stop points is perpendicular to the opposite edge.
The line breaks between results are in ascii, but each entry is in in sys.filesystemencoding().
The link already exists.
The link with index 0 is not the first video of the playlist (not sure if still actual)
The list itself can't influence the variables dict, and ProcessVariablesAndConditionsInList will make copies of the variables dict if it needs to pass it to something that can influence it.
The list of apps that are handled
The list of known platforms.
The list of targets upon which the 'all' target should depend.
The loaded salary of 3000 gets saved, the name of 'Clerk' isn't overwritten.
The locale directory for this app is generated automatically by the test cases.
The location and size of the box will be updated during the drawing time.
The lock gets in the way of copying as implemented in clone(), which is called whenever Django duplicates a StateApps before updating it.
The log directory exists
The log where to store warnings
The log_out function will still trigger the signal for anonymous users.
The logic here is: if the main model's primary key is in the query, then set new_expressions to that field.
The logic is the same for all float types so only test double types for now.
The long type was removed in Python 3.
The lookup below helps selecting the right ctypes object for a given gdal pixel type.
The loop variables were pushed on to the context so pop them off again.
The low bit of the unpacked value is the sign.
The low level calls above do not preserve the newline characters at the end of the input data, so we use the calculate the difference in newlines and append them to the resulting output for parity
The low precision is for SpatiaLite
The low precision tolerance is for SpatiaLite
The low-level knowledge about pdf syntax lies mainly in the pdfRepr function and the classes Reference, Name, Operator, and Stream.
The lower-case forms are of course incorrect and unofficial, but we support those too
The ls_mapper maps short codes for line style to their full name used by backends The reverse mapper is for mapping full names to short ones
The m2m data won't be saved until save_m2m() is invoked on the form.
The main benchmark emits its own line.
The main data transformation is set up.
The main event -- substitute the JSON args string into the module
The main things we want for sure are (a) simple external access to kinds, (b) a place to hang a description and name, (c) easy to keep in sync with Index.h.
The mainloop is running.
The major speed trap here is just converting to the points to an array in the first place.
The make generator does this always.
The make generator doesn't support it, so forbid it everywhere to keep the generators more interchangable.
The makefile rules are all relative to the top dir, but the gyp actions are defined relative to their containing dir.
The managers on this model should be ordered by their creation counter and not by the order in model body
The mapping is 0: default, 1: false, 2: true.
The margin adjustment is a hack to deal with the fact that we don't want to transform all the symbols whose scales are in points to data coords to get the exact bounding box for efficiency reasons.
The marks on a page consist of text and boxes.
The mask wasn't set: create a full version.
The master app registry is always ready when the tests run.
The master toctree document.
The matrix class messes with the shape.
The max length of the names of the indexes (restricted to 30 due to Oracle)
The maximum length of a full host name is 253 characters per RFC 1034 section 3.1.
The maximum number of forms should respect 'get_max_num' on the ModelAdmin
The maximum number of items to display in a QuerySet.__repr__
The maximum number we can get with each request
The maximum value of the first level index for supp tables.
The md5 checksum changes
The md5 checksum changes on each download
The mechanism for getting at the related model is slightly odd - ideally, we'd just ask for field.related_model.
The memcached backends don't support cull-related options like `MAX_ENTRIES`.
The memory layout of the temporary should match a (a is (48,4,16)) except negative strides get flipped to positive strides.
The mesh should be smooth and soft.
The message and module (filename) match
The message is optional, in which case None is stored for each rule source.
The message should contain the broadcast shape
The message should contain the itershape parameter
The message should contain the shape of the 3rd operand
The message should contain the shape of the bad operand
The metadata of the result should become the GCD of the operand metadata
The migration isn't applied backward.
The missing MOCK_METHOD is usually one or two lines back, so scan back one or two lines.
The missing spaces will be flagged by CheckSpacing.
The mixes are generated from a single video the id of the playlist is just 'RD' + video_id
The model being renamed does not participate in this relation directly.
The model field name.
The model was auto-created as intermediary for a ManyToMany-relationship, find the target model
The models definitions below used to crash.
The models will get auto-added into the state, though so we're fine.
The module is assumed to be a binary
The module is not a package.
The module to store session data
The most basic valid indexing
The mouse is moving relative to the window, but this may surpise an event handler writer who is getting motion_notify_events even if the mouse has not moved here are the three scenarios
The msvs specific sections that hold paths
The multi-indices should be correct with any reordering
The multiprocessing pool.
The name "fixture5" is ambiguous, so loading it will raise an error
The name definitions of comprehenions shouldn't be part of the current scope.
The name for this set of Sphinx documents.
The name isn't shared by one of the instances (i.e., the default) so pick the first instance as the default.
The name may be an alias.
The name must not be in the dictionary, but part of the class definition.
The name of an image file (relative to this directory) to place at the top of the title page.
The name of the DOCUMENTATION template
The name of the Pygments (syntax highlighting) style to use.
The name of the builddir.
The name of the current section.
The name of the file uploaded and the file stored in the server-side shouldn't differ.
The name refers to module.
The need for this setting is explained above where _intermediate_var is defined.
The new file is different from the old one, or there is no old one.
The new file is identical to the old one, just get rid of the new one.
The new indent needs to be higher
The new temporary file is then compared to the existing project file, if any.
The newline is either in the endmarker as a prefix or the previous leaf as a newline token.
The newly selected pk should appear in the raw id input.
The next 7 palettes are from the Yorick scientific visalisation package, an evolution of the GIST package, both by David H.
The next common higher level is __init__.py::run() and that has tasks inside of play_iterator so we'd have to extract them to do it there.
The next connect() will reset the transaction state anyway.
The nocolor palette has all available roles.
The nodata value is part of the PGRaster string even if the nodata flag is True, so it always has to be chunked off the data string.
The non-hack way to fix this is to have powershell modules be a different PluginLoader/ModuleLoader.
The non-optimized version works, too.
The normal client allows the post
The normalization happens in AbstractBaseUser.clean()
The normalization happens in AbstractBaseUser.clean() and ModelForm validation calls Model.clean().
The notice and error handler C function callback definitions.
The number 100 is just a heuristic number that is appropriate currently since LTO uses so much memory.
The number of arguments the function accepts.
The number of days a password reset link is valid for
The number of different sizes of chars to use, beyond which they will not get any smaller
The number of other 2nd grade boys
The number of ticks needs to be reduced if there are more than self.numticks of them.
The numbers amount is picked to force three different IN batches for Oracle, yet to be less than 2100 parameter limit for MSSQL.
The numbers are Apple radar IDs.
The numerators also need to be masked so that masked division will be invoked.
The numeric mode to assign to newly-created directories, when uploading files.
The numeric mode to set newly-uploaded files to.
The numpy subclassing interface simply doesn't give us any way to know, which means that at best this method will be based on guesswork and heuristics.
The object User1 edited in step 3 is displayed on the changelist and has the correct edits applied.
The object isn't saved an thus the relation field is null - we won't even execute a query in this case.
The object_list is converted to a list so that if it was a QuerySet it won't be a database hit per __getitem__.
The offset is due to the way the barb is initially drawn, going down the y-axis.
The offset isn't calculated yet : as we don't know how big the figure will be in pixels.
The old function finding mechanism skipped ahead based on the first argument, but that does not produce properly symmetric results...
The old method above does not work when only SDK is installed.
The old related instance was thrown away (the selfref_id has changed).
The old savefig.extension could also have a value of "auto", but the new savefig.format does not.
The old state keeps as-is, we continue with the new state
The only difference is the depth of the nesting as we now use 4 models instead of 3 (and thus 3 relations).
The only differences are the last two parts.
The only dirctories where that is standard are the tmp dirs, /tmp and /var/tmp.
The only exception is inside 'atomic' blocks.
The only exception we regularly allow is "unsigned short port" for port.
The only other case we accept is a ':'-separated list of patterns.
The only other function this is used to wrap currently is socket.create_connection, which should be passed a 2-tuple, but we'll check just in case
The only place where you can get a title, it's not complete, but searching in other places doesn't work for all videos
The only slight complexity here is handling fields that exist on parent models.
The only subclass of PBXGroup, PBXVariantGroup, should not participate in reparenting in the same way: reparenting by merging different object types would be wrong.
The only tricky thing here is to ensure that we do the related selections properly after unpickling.
The only workaround is to put rules and their inputs in a separate target from the one that compiles the rule outputs.
The opening angle bracket is probably there if we look for it, so just return early here.
The operation failed, possibly because the file is set to read-only.
The operation id, informed by the client and returned by the server to make sure both are talking about the same thing.
The option can be either in the form "-I /path/to/dir" or "-I/path/to/dir" so handle both.
The opus codec doesn't support the -aq option
The order of infinity (0 - 3) for the glue
The order of the (empty) values, annotate and extra clauses doesn't matter
The order of these fields matter, do not change.
The ordering by others__single__pk will add one new join (to single) and that join must be LEFT join.
The ordering can be altered
The ordering of model fields might vary depending on several factors (version of GDAL, etc.)
The ordering of the zip calls matter - zip throws StopIteration when an iter throws it.
The ordering required to allow for monkeypatching causes the warning "I100 Import statements are in the wrong order." when linting using flake8-import-order.
The ordering we really want is objects, mgr1, mgr2
The original parent had a sourceTree set, use it.
The original problem was that the inner queries weren't relabeled correctly.
The original query still works correctly
The original version of Livestream uses a different system
The other bins do not.
The other intelligent aspects of merge processing won't apply because item is being merged into an empty dict.
The other messages get passed along to matplotlib as-is.
The other option, PROJECT_DERIVED_FILE_DIR, is unsuitable because while it is project-specific, it is not configuration-specific.
The other project reports its path as relative to the same directory that this project's path is relative to.
The other project's path is not necessarily already relative to this project.
The other three should no longer exist.
The other three stand for new lines.
The other type of broadcasting would require a reduction operation.
The other way is to subclass the original lookup and register the subclassed lookup instead of the original.
The others affect the (shared) canvas as a whole.
The outermost takes precedence.
The output method is called by the RendererPdf class, which contains the various draw_foo methods.
The output of virtinfo is different whether we are on a machine with logical domains ('LDoms') on a T-series or domains ('Domains') on a M-series.
The page shouldn't display a link to the nonexistent change page
The page that contains all of the figures
The page that contains all of the pieces
The paper size ('letterpaper' or 'a4paper').
The parallel bezier lines are constructed by following ways.
The parameter that should be used in the query string for that filter.
The params list may contain expressions which compile to a sql/param pair.
The parent object should have been deleted as well.
The parent_link connector need not be the pk on the model.
The parentheses are important for efficiency here -- they group the last two (which are usually affines) separately from the first (which, with log-scaling can be non-affine).
The parents are obviously wrong, but that's not an issue.
The parser would handle it, but since the fast parser abuses the normal parser in various ways, we need to care for this ourselves.
The particular cache to look for modules within.
The path of last found header.
The path of the session cookie.
The path travelled, this includes the path to the multijoin.
The path type is needed for regenerating, for optparse we can just treat it as a string.
The path.join_field is a Rel, lets get the other side's field
The paths in build_files were relativized above, so undo that before testing against the non-relativized items in target_list and before calculating the Makefile path.
The paths were the same.
The patterns below are used to generate SQL pattern lookup clauses when the right-hand side of the lookup isn't a raw string (it might be an expression or the result of a bilateral transformation).
The peculiar calculations of xscale and yscale are specific to a Aitoff-Hammer projection, so don't worry about them too much.
The percent symbol needs escaping in latex
The person has been deleted ...
The person still exists ...
The pgpass temporary file needs to be encoded using the system locale.
The pickled state is simply a tuple of the WKB (in string form) and the SRID.
The platform module provides information about the running system/distribution.
The platform will send the event when it thinks it is a good time (usually as soon as there are no other events pending).
The playpath starts at 'mp4:', if we don't manually split the url, rtmpdump will incorrectly parse them
The point for La Grange, TX
The policy is that if you #include something in foo.h you don't need to include it again in foo.cc.
The position should be reset if the current scope is a function.
The positional arguments here extract the hex-encoded srid from the header of the PostGIS raster string.
The potential ambiguity with a sequence of 3 or 4 numbers is resolved in favor of mapping, not rgb or rgba.
The pre-existing join should remain INNER.
The prefix to put on the default database name when creating the test database.
The prerequisites for this rule are the rule source itself and the set of additional rule inputs, if any.
The previous changes shouldn't affect nullable foreign key joins.
The previous technique dealt with "hard-coded" initial data, but it's also possible to specify initial data after you've already created the Form class (i.e., at runtime).
The previous technique dealt with raw values as initial data, but it's also possible to specify callable data.
The primary key can be accessed via the pk property on the model.
The primary key must also obviously be unique, so trying to create a new object with the same primary key will fail.
The primary key must be specified, so an error is raised if you try to create an object without it.
The principle is simple: we first find low and high bounds of size for the type, where low/high are looked up on a log scale.
The problem here was that b__name generates a LOUTER JOIN, then b__c__name generates join to c, which the ORM tried to promote but failed as that join isn't nullable.
The problem is easy_install runs it's own setup(), which sets up distutils.core._setup_distribution.
The problem is that if any properties have been changed by methods other than the colorbar methods, those changes will be lost.
The process here is identical to ITERATING_TASKS, except instead we move into the always portion of the block.
The process is terminated.
The projection must specify a name.
The proper fix would be to defer all decisions where is_nullable() is needed to the compiler stage, but that is not easy to do currently.
The publisher should have one book.
The publisher should have three books.
The query structure is such that we have multiple nested subqueries.
The query.group_by is either None (no GROUP BY at all), True (group by select fields), or a list of expressions to be added to the group by.
The queryset must be reduced to a list of values using values(), then converted into a query
The question is now: what to do with this test
The quotes delimit the arguments on Windows, and the arguments might be file paths with spaces.
The r-axis labels are put at an angle and padded in the r-direction
The raising is effectively tested above.
The raster in the model is not strictly below
The raster in the model is strictly below
The rationale behind the 32MB can be found on Django's Trac: https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/5596#comment:4
The reST default role (used for this markup: `text`) to use for all documents.
The real width, height and depth will be set during the pack phase, after we know the real fontsize
The reason for not subtracting and escaping "/" is that we are escaping the entire path, not a path segment.
The receiver is either a function or an instance of class defining a `__call__` method.
The record array stores python datetime.date as an object array in the date column
The redirect target responds with a 301 code, not 200
The referer is empty.
The referer is equal to the current URL, ignoring the scheme (assumed to be a poorly implemented bot).
The regular expression we use to match compiler-crasher lines.
The related _model_, not a field was passed in -- indicating another mapping for the related Model.
The related fetches are done in batches.
The related instance is loaded from the database and then cached in the attribute defined in self.cache_name.
The related object is registered with the same AdminSite
The related_id is alawys set even if it's not fetched from the DB, so pk and related_id are not deferred.
The relationship model is not installed.
The relative difference is a ratio, so it's always unit-less.
The relative difference of the two values.
The remaining bits point to the next blockable in the chain.
The remaining elements of an object dictionary are sorted alphabetically.
The remaining methods are order-aware.
The remote user we will request from docker (if supported)
The renderer should be re-created by the figure, and then cached at that point.
The reorder_for_init attribute contains a function used to reorder the field data in the order __init__ expects it.
The reprojection of a raster that spans over a large area skews the data matrix and might introduce nodata values.
The request logger receives events for any problematic request The security logger receives events for all SuspiciousOperations
The request was a followed redirect
The resolver is checked recursively (examining url()s in include()).
The resources phase should come before the sources and frameworks phases, if any.
The response also converts unicode or bytes keys to strings, but requires them to contain ASCII
The rest is linear interpolation with extrapolation at ends.
The rest of the code in this class is to facilitate easy blitting
The rest of the exception message differs between Python 2 and 3.
The rest of the tokens
The result is split at ',' and a list of values returned.
The result of the lookup should be translated at rendering time.
The resulting form subclass will have all of the fields of the parent Form, plus whichever fields you define in the subclass.
The resulting image may have offsets from lower-left corner of the original image
The resulting ps file has the given size with correct bounding box so that there is no need to call 'pstoeps'
The resulting state should include applied migrations.
The resulting state should still include applied migrations.
The results are hosted at https://xkcd.com/color/rgb.txt
The results should match, and y_base shouldn't get clobbered
The results will be correct but this creates too many joins.
The return type is derived from the composed aggregate
The return value is used in pstoeps step to recover the correct bounding box.
The reverse relation also works if the OneToOneField is null.
The right and top spines have a default position of 1 in axes coordinates.
The right callable should be used for the inline readonly_fields column cells
The right hand side cannot be converted to an array here.
The right mouse button pops up a context menu, which doesn't work very well, so use the middle mouse button instead.
The role must be in upper case
The root directory used for deriving header guard CPP variable.
The rows of Vh are the eigenvectors of a.H a.
The rule action script would need to touch the dummy.
The rule message and action have already had the necessary variable substitutions performed.
The rules are - The priority from low to high is gcc/g++, the 'make_global_settings' in gyp, the environment variable.
The runtime for Argon2 is too complicated to implement a sensible hardening algorithm.
The safe-guarding will be handled at a higher level by the `BaseDatabaseWrapper.allow_thread_sharing` property.
The same behavior for iexact query.
The same condition is often evaluated over and over again so it makes sense to cache as much as possible between evaluations.
The same data as above, but fill the curves.
The same flags check is also used in the tests to switch behavior.
The same for our new query.
The same function can operate on a 4-d array:
The same operations should be optimized if app_label and none of bases belong to that app.
The same operations should be optimized if app_label is specified and a FK references a model from the other app.
The same request through a different middleware won't hit
The same request with a timeout _will_ hit
The same result can occur in some rare cases when the database returns zero despite the UPDATE being executed successfully (a row is matched and updated).
The same should happen with a lookup by natural key
The same test case as the last one, but for one-to-one models, which are implemented slightly different internally, so it's a different code path.
The same video as https://twitter.com/i/videos/tweet/705235433198714880 Test case of TwitterCardIE
The same, but for run_test_targets.
The save is also forced to be raw.
The save method is a raw base model save, to make sure that the data in the database matches the exact test case.
The save_as_new parameter lets you re-associate the data to a new instance.
The saved stack will allow us to restore the parsing state in the #else case.
The savepoint won't be reused.
The scale argument wasn't necessary since the data was already normalized.
The scale class must have a member ``name`` that defines the string used to select the scale.
The score should be weighted by where in the list the font was found.
The script wrapper of the library is for testing purpose.
The search sorted routines use the compare functions for the array type, so this checks if that is consistent with the sort order.
The second argument is an addition that causes a pylint warning.
The second array doesn't make sense, or it doesn't exist
The second block has a savepoint and must roll back.
The second buffer will need to be transformed, however.
The second byte indicates whether the interface is in promiscuous mode.
The second condition avoids creating useless savepoints and prevents overwriting needs_rollback until the rollback is performed.
The second example illustrates the use of a ListedColormap, a BoundaryNorm, and extended ends to show the "over" and "under" value colors.
The second flow doesn't appear because its value is zero.
The second insert couldn't be roll back.
The second item should be a boolean indicating whether files should be added into hierarchical groups or one single flat group.
The second union aggregate is for a union query that includes limiting information in the WHERE clause (in other words a `.filter()` precedes the call to `.aggregate(Union()`).
The second use of itemsize was throwing an exception because in ctors.c, discover_itemsize was calling PyObject_Length without checking the return code.
The second user only exists on the default database
The second user only exists on the other database
The second value is normalized to an empty name by MultiPartParser.IE_sanitize()
The secret internal related names for self-referential many-to-many fields shouldn't appear in the list when an error is made.
The segments array for line collection needs to be numlines x points per line x 2 (x and y)
The select is used for cases where we want to set up the select clause to contain other than default fields (values(), subqueries...) Note that annotations go to annotations dictionary.
The select, klass_info, and annotations are needed by QuerySet.iterator() these are set as a side-effect of executing the query.
The select_related join was promoted as there is already an existing join.
The select_related join wasn't promoted as there was already an existing (even if trimmed) inner join to state.
The self-weakref trick is needed to avoid creating a reference cycle.
The sender should stay the same when using defer().
The sensitive_variables decorator was used, so we take note of the sensitive variables' names.
The sentinel element never gets deleted (this simplifies the algorithm).
The server URL is hardcoded
The server doesn't support HEAD request, the generic extractor can't detect the redirection
The server doesn't support HEAD requests
The server time may be different from local time
The session doesn't exist to start.
The session is accessed so "Vary: Cookie" should be set.
The session key is rotated.
The session should be deleted only if the session is entirely empty
The set of all build files that have been scheduled, so we don't schedule the same one twice.
The settings are: filetype : used for explicitFileType in the project file prefix : the prefix for the file name suffix : the suffix for the file name
The setuptools version of sdist adds a setup.cfg file to the tree.
The shape shouldn't matter
The shared dictionary for notified handlers is a proxy, which does not detect when sub-objects within the proxy are modified.
The shared library for the GeoIP C API.
The short X.Y version (including .devXXXX, rcX, b1 suffixes if present)
The short X.Y version.
The similarity of the code below to the code in ForwardManyToOneDescriptor is annoying, but there's a bunch of small differences that would make a common base class convoluted.
The slices will be ordered and plotted counter-clockwise.
The slugs got prepopulated didn't change since they were originally not empty
The slugs got prepopulated since they were originally empty
The sole purpose of this class is to look at the upper, lower, or total interval as appropriate and see what parts of the tick to draw, if any.
The solution actually does more calculations than necessary but exploiting the power of numpy, this is far more efficient than coding a loop by hand in Python
The solution here is to let the FigureCanvas acquire a lock on the fontd at the start of the draw, and release it when it is done.
The solution is to move the include out of the #ifdef.
The source can't be found.
The source directory tree.
The spaces within the variables are valid, so remove the variables before checking.
The spacing that works for the barbs is a little to much for the flags, but this only occurs when we have more than 1 flag.
The spec explicitly defined an external builder, so don't change it.
The spec only allows ASCII.
The split function is essentially the same as array_split, except that it test if splitting will result in an equal split.
The split is necessary for sphinx beta versions where the string is '6b1'
The src is a file pointing to the real video file
The standard File contains most of the necessary properties, but FieldFiles can be instantiated without a name, so that needs to be checked for here.
The state of the parser is maintained in a stack.
The storage doesn't support get_modified_time() or failed
The style sheet to use for HTML and HTML Help pages.
The sub-expression `source` has already been resolved, as this is just a reference to the name of `source`.
The subclasses for OGR Geometry.
The subcommands in this function make it easier to debug ansiballz modules.
The subgroup names must themselves be declared as groups, but as before, they may only be declared later.
The subject is only checked when there is no dNSName entry in subjectAltName
The subquery containing generate_series can be replaced with "WITH ORDINALITY" when support for PostgreSQL 9.3 is dropped.
The subquery result cache should not be populated
The suffix of source filenames.
The suffix(es) of source filenames.
The sum of probs should be 1.0 with some tolerance.
The super block will still be found.
The super call needs to happen first because it uses the database.
The super calls needs to happen first for the settings override.
The supp tables contain entries for BMP code units to simplify trie implementation, but those BMP entries are filled with the default value, so they compress well.
The support project also gets the dependencies (in case they are needed for the actions/rules to work).
The supported URL schemes
The sysroot directory should match the one specified in build/common.gypi.
The sysroot image could be constructed from scratch based on the current state or Debian Wheezy but for consistency we currently use a pre-built root image.
The sysroot is needed to make Chrome work for Debian Wheezy.
The table doesn't have an index
The table is manually created by the test method.
The tablespaces to use for each model when not specified otherwise.
The target color is fig.patch.get_facecolor()
The target doesn't contain the source, but the dependent targets have not yet been visited to determine a more specific status yet.
The target has a dependency on another target that contains one of the supplied paths.
The target is linkable, add it to the list of link dependencies.
The target's sources contain one of the supplied paths.
The target's sources weren't in the supplied paths and none of the target's dependencies depend upon a target that matched.
The task defined by common-role exists twice because role1 and role2 depend on common-role.
The temp directory is a symlink, which our resolve_include function would follow, so we need to follow the symlink here too.
The territory overrides NLS_DATE_FORMAT and NLS_TIMESTAMP_FORMAT to the territory default.
The test condition needs to be at least a factor of sqrt(2) smaller because the real and imaginary parts both change
The test is going to access a static file stored in this application.
The test is to ensure consistentency.
The test needs to be done on a specific string as IOError is raised even without the patch (just not early enough)
The test still lives here to factor it between other backends.
The test suite relies on this in testing exit().
The tests are similar since they both set up a situation where the system time zone, Django's TIME_ZONE, and UTC are distinct.
The tests in the remainder of this function should be passed by any triangulation that does not contain duplicate points.
The text in this example is placed in the fractional figure coordinate system.
The third element is the space (in multiples of underline height)
The third example illustrates the use of custom length colorbar extensions, used on a colorbar with discrete intervals.
The third insert couldn't be roll back.
The thread should immediately block, but we'll sleep for a bit to make sure.
The through model has dependencies to them though, so it should come last.
The tick labels will be offset 4 pixels from the edge of the axes ellipse.
The tick labels will be offset 4 pixels from the equator.
The ticks and label have already been placed on the right by twinx above.
The tolerance value is to four decimal places because of differences between the Oracle and PostGIS spatial backends on the extent calculation.
The total number of bytes currently allocated with size above threshold
The total number of forms will remain the same in either case
The total size of the iterator must not exceed the maximum intp due to broadcasting.
The tracks usually expire after 1 months, so we can't add tests.
The transAxes transform is used because the Text object rotates the text relative to the display coordinate system.
The transaction is marked as needing rollback.
The transformation of each handle will be automatically set to self.get_trasnform().
The transforms are automatically simplified, if possible, by the underlying transformation framework.
The translation unit cursor exists primarily to act as the root cursor for traversing the contents of a translation unit.
The triangles in parameter space determine which x, y, z points are connected by an edge.
The ttf to ps (subsetting) support doesn't work for OpenType fonts that are Postscript inside (like the STIX fonts).
The tuple and coords properties
The tuple conversion is now done in a try...except in case it fails.
The tuple may be a point or a box
The two Note items should be different.
The two images are solid color, with the second image being exactly 1 color value brighter.
The two new passwords do not match.
The two sets do not intersect, meaning the pk isn't present.
The two templates should not have the same content
The type with "+bundle" appended will be used if the target has "mac_bundle" set.
The typedef is a declaration of size_type (CXCursor_TypedefDecl), while the type of the variable "size" is referenced.
The ufuncs always produce native-endian results
The underlying database connection.
The underlying query only makes one join when a related table is referenced twice.
The unique constraint on OneToOneField is replaced with an index for ForeignKey.
The unique constraint remains.
The unique kind objects, index by id.
The unique kind objects, indexed by id.
The unmanaged models need to be removed after the test in order to prevent bad interactions with the flush operation in other tests.
The unpickling code in numpy.core.multiarray is written to assume that unicode data appearing where binary should be is in 'latin1'.
The unquoted segments are at the even-numbered indices.
The unwrapped value is returned as the first item of the arguments tuple.
The update remains and it blocked.
The update() command can update fields in parent and child classes at once (although it executed multiple SQL queries to do so).
The url doesn't have an rtmp app, we have to extract the playpath
The url fields should be able to accurately detect where the password ends so the length should be the same:
The url may contain the language
The usage comments use the notation of the operator summary in the PostScript Language reference manual.
The use of 'user' in the Play datastructure was deprecated to line up with the same change for Tasks, due to the fact that 'user' conflicted with the user module.
The use of atleast_1d allows for handling scalar arguments while also keeping masked arrays
The use of from_field comes from the need to avoid cascade back to parent when parent delete is cascading to child.
The use of more than one of these options together will trigger an Error
The used_joins for a tuple of expressions is the union of the used_joins for the individual expressions.
The user can't add sections yet, so they shouldn't see the "add section" link.
The user can't change sections yet, so they shouldn't see the "change section" link.
The user can't delete sections yet, so they shouldn't see the "delete section" link.
The user has already confirmed the deletion.
The user has confirmed the deletion.
The user is inactive, but our custom form policy allows them to log in.
The user is inactive.
The user needs to have the change permission for the related model in order to be able to do anything with the intermediate model.
The user submits an invalid username.
The user will find out once they execute the command.
The value and key can both be null.
The value doesn't matter, we just need any negative constraint on a related model that's a noop.
The value formatting is cute, but not really used right now.
The value from etag_func() could be quoted or unquoted.
The value from the form's initial data is used.
The value is too big for IPv6.
The value of inherit_unique_symroot decides, if a configuration is assumed to inherit a unique 'SYMROOT' attribute from its parent, if it doesn't define an explicit value for 'SYMROOT'.
The value of this option must be the base URL from which the finished HTML is served.
The value will end up being ignored by our __reduce__ and custom unpickler.
The values from the first array should always come before the values from the second array.
The values here are exactly the same check as in _split_parts, but this time with tokenize and therefore precise.
The values may be anything, so the caller must ensure that PDF names are represented as Name objects.
The values should be Geometry objects and not raw strings returned by the spatial database.
The values to use for "blank" in SelectFields.
The values() command also works on fields from parent models.
The values() method works with "extra" fields specified in extra(select).
The variable name is the key name in the "variables" dict.
The variable name is the key name with a "_" character prepended.
The variable seq will contain a sequence of font and text entries.
The variant group name is the same as the basename (MainMenu.nib in the example above).
The vault format is pure ascii so if we failed to encode to bytes via ascii we know that this is not vault data.
The verbose_name, in particular, did not always work.
The verification password is incorrect.
The version of FreeType to install locally for running the tests.
The version that we will be importing the tests from.
The very last bit must be the context name
The video id is in the redirected url
The video in the original webpage now uses PlayWire
The videos are contained in a single page the ajax pages can't be used, they are empty
The videos usually expire in 7 days, so we can't add tests.
The view shouldn't be cached on the second call.
The weak precision in the assertions is because the BoundingCircle calculation changed on PostGIS 2.3.
The weekdays are Friday, Saturday, and Monday
The when has already been evaluated by this point, and is not used again, so we don't care about mangling that value now
The whole block is an inline assembly block Match start of assembly blocks
The widget will use the choices defined on the Field, not the ones defined on the Widget.
The width and height of the legendPatch will be set (in the draw()) to the length that includes the padding.
The width is padded by the arrows, so we don't need to pad it.
The wish is that the instance has been already saved to DB, although having a pk value isn't a guarantee of that.
The work bound below can't be reduced much.
The workaround is to put a "conditions" section within a "variables" section.
The workflow of the harness is the following: o Basing on the input files, generate 'processed' files.
The wrapper accepts only positional arguments: we use `names` and `inds` to mutate `the_args` and `kwargs` to pass to the original function.
The xcode build is relative to a gyp file's directory, and OTHER_LDFLAGS can contain entries that depend on this.
The xcode generator special-cases global xcode_settings and does something that amounts to merging in the global xcode_settings into each local xcode_settings dict.
The xlim is fixed, no matter what you do
The xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax of the MultiPoint should be returned.
The zero series needs special treatment
The zipfile will read the string and then the format.read_array will copy the string to another place in memory.
Their spelling never changes and is consequently provided by this spelling cache.
Theme options are theme-specific and customize the look and feel of a theme further.
Then a function "toggle_element" sets the visibility attribute of all patches of each histogram and the opacity of the marker itself.
Then check that the round trip works.
Then create the test points
Then delete the existing file if really needed
Then do some state reduction.
Then filter out specific passes.
Then gather them from the model admin and all parent classes, starting with self and working back up.
Then get the history for this object.
Then if obj is structured with void type convert it to the same dtype.type (eg to preserve numpy.record type if present), since nested structured fields do not inherit type.
Then it will be shrinked by shirnkA and shrinkB (in points).
Then it will be shrunk by shirnkA and shrinkB (in points).
Then look for multi-figure output files
Then make sure that it *does* pass validation and delete the object, even though the data in new forms aren't actually valid.
Then make sure that it *does* pass validation and delete the object, even though the data isn't actually valid.
Then output the boxes (e.g., variable-length lines of square roots).
Then pack it according to the dtype's nesting
Then re-enable all of the original events.
Then remove each related field
Then standard model tables
Then the results should be a string suitable for stdout.
Then there will be no distinction between axes.add_line, axes.add_patch, etc.
Then visit all subclasses
Then we clear the internal list of failed hosts so we know what failed this round.
Then we'll use the formset to validate/process POSTed data.
Then when it gets merged kill your hack.
Then write out an edge using the rule.
Then yield the thing we found.
Then, add the path to the query's joins.
Then, if we have a match, redo the substitution with quoted arguments in order to return a properly encoded URL.
Then, make a Model object (apps.register_model is called in __new__)
Then, we do a binary search to find the exact size between low and high
Then, we let every list filter modify the queryset to its liking.
Then, with explicitly enabling the connection for sharing.
Then, work out our bases
There 's no 'Choose all' button in vertical mode, so individually select all options and click 'Choose'.
There 's no 'Remove all' button in vertical mode, so individually select all options and click 'Remove'.
There are a couple of ways to do multiple-field validation.
There are a number of cases where comparing two arrays hits special cases in array_richcompare, specifically around strings and void dtypes.
There are already too many Youtube downloads
There are certain situations we allow one space, notably for section labels
There are different sources of video in arte.tv, the extraction process is different for each one.
There are many more kwargs, but the following gives a basic continuous colorbar with ticks and labels.
There are multiple videos in the playlist whlie only the first one matches the video played in browsers

There are some object array corner cases here, but we cannot avoid that:
There are still some edge cases where alignment is not quite right, but this seems to be more of a geometry issue (in other words, I might be using the wrong reference points).
There are three books with rating of 4.0 and two of the books have the same price.
There are three ways to get this info the canvas:
There are three ways we might decide not to print an error message: a "NOLINT(category)" comment appears in the source, the verbosity level isn't high enough, or the filters filter it out.
There are two implementations of `open` for either python 2/3.
There are two value members that must be defined.
There are two ways to specify bins.

There could be room for improvement.
There currently aren't.
There doesn't seem to be any other way to provide a way to (not) print that works correctly across Python 2 and 3.

There is a bug in Python 3.x where it leaks frame references, and therefore can't handle this caching
There is a heuristic here that the aspect ratio of tick text is no more than 3:1
There is a possibility the .git file to have an absolute path.
There is a property is_geoprotection, but that's always false
There is a similar test in `layermap` that uses the same data set, but the County model here is a bit different.
There is a subtlety here: we want to avoid whenever possible that refined points container is a masked triangle (which would result in artifacts in plots).
There is always one test group, for the HTTP server errors.
There is currently no logic on deciding what these nontrivial things are, so this check is triggered by namespace size only, which works most of the time.

There is nothing we can do about this.
There is only the base table in use in the query.
There is probably a better way to do this in the FigureManager base class.

There isn't any object on the remote side of the fk_rel relation.
There may be junk add the end of the file See http://stackoverflow.com/q/4928560/35070 for details
There may be other metrics present, but only these are needed

There may need to be some other mechanism where we exclude certain kinds of field attributes, or make this list more automatic in some way so we don't have to remember to update it manually.
There may not be a 'server_thread' attribute if setUpClass() for some reasons has raised an exception.
There must be a more efficient way...

There shouldn't be space around unary operators
There was a bug that made the later assignment throw a ValueError do to an incorrectly transposed temporary right hand side (gh-5714)
There was a bug triggering reuse of the reduce loop inappropriately, which caused processing to happen in unnecessarily small chunks and overran the buffer.
There was a but that caused _meta ordering to be used.
There was previously a bug that meant that if rc_context failed and raised an exception due to issues in the supplied rc parameters, the global rc parameters were left in a modified state.
There were "issues" when ordering and distinct-ing on fields related via ForeignKeys.
There were some issues with various Paramiko versions.
There will be more chances to add it to flat_list when examining it again as a dependent of those other dependencies, provided that there are no cycles.

There would be only 1 row to loop over
There's a possibility OSError would be raised for some other reason, in which case this error message would be inaccurate.
There's a race condition with the controller removing the remote_tmpdir and this module executing under async.
There's a special case for "for" since the style guide allows space before the semicolon there.
There's already a PBXBuildFile in this phase corresponding to the PBXVariantGroup.

There's no compelling reason for Xcode's linker invocations to differ.
There's no module yet.
There's no need for the model fields to validate them as well.
There's no need to write anything into the script to ensure that the output directories already exist, because Xcode will look at the declared outputs and automatically ensure that they exist for us.
There's no point in going forward if the initial contenttypes migration is unapplied as the ContentType model will be unavailable from this point.
There's no reason to move if we don't have to.

There's only one ChordsBand instance
There's only one Concert instance
There's only one Group instance
There's only one Quartet instance
There's only one format available
There's probably a better way to do this by embedding all this in the object's transformations, but I don't grok the transformation stuff well enough yet.
There's two levels of architecture/platform specification in VS.
There, the defaults apply.
Therefore an execution is necessary.
Therefore avoid the cost of conversion.
Therefore for extraction pass we have to override Accept-Encoding to any in order to accept raw bytes and being able to download only a chunk.
Therefore it is easy to make a local version that gives full putmask behavior, but duplicating the full copyto behavior would be more difficult.
Therefore look if gunicorn is a parent directory, #56.
Therefore test it separately.

Therefore we disable this for now.
Therefore we don't check that the user is root when using this connection.
Therefore we just add fake names to that and we're done.

Therefore we return `__main__` in ModuleWrapper.py__name__(), which is similar to Python behavior.
Therefore, bind to the window and filter.
Therefore, remove the last value from the z array.
Therefore, set position to 0 (0 is not a valid line number).
Therefore, the browser sends back an "ack" message after each image frame is received.
Therefore, the input values will be in range (-xmin, 0), (xmax, 1).
Therefore, the input values will be in range (0, -ymin), (1, ymax).
Therefore, the port is not available for Nuclide server.
Therefore, we break the string into chunks, where each chunk contains exclusively 1-byte or exclusively 2-byte characters, and output each chunk a separate command.
Therefore, we can't use isinstance() to check for the six meta path importer, since the other six instance will have inserted an importer with different class.
Therefore, we need to convert the buffer.
Therefore, we only CSRF protect the internal implementation.
Therefore, we'll need to convert the given dx and dy from decimal degrees to meters.

These are valid but maybe not what the user intended
These assignments are OK -- None is allowed because it's equivalent to the NULL pointer.
These backends are listed in order of preference, the first being the most preferred.
These calls may abort.
These can be different fields because model inheritance allows single model to have effectively multiple primary keys.
These can be overridden in settings (see `read_settings`).
These can be specified in means beyond what argparse supports, so we gather them in a list and parse them manually.
These can be valid for both frameworks and static libraries.
These cannot run on non-Windows as they require a VS installation to correctly handle variable expansion.

These validators can't be added at field initialization time since they're based on values retrieved from `connection`.
These values are only used for plotting the legend handle.
These values, if given to validate(), will trigger the self.required check.
These variables are described at https://www.serfdom.io/docs/commands/members.html#_rpc_addr

These will load using the 'default' database identifier implicitly
These will remove pieces of contour if they have length zero
They affect the size of the lookup tables (and thus, lookup time), but do not change the overall structure of the trie.
They are also a angle of the tangential line of the path at c1 and c2
They are also a angle of the tangential line of the path at c1 and c3
They are copied after the builtin static files, so a file named "default.css" will overwrite the builtin "default.css".
They are disabled by default because they are slower.
They are ignored by default.
They are meaningless for type mh_bundle.
They are mutually exclusive.
They are part of the comprehension scope.
They are unnecessary here.

They can be set during the initialization.
They can only be executed when the user explicitly adds a --force command-line argument.
They contain the message and action to perform after resolving input-dependent variables.

They don't implement __eq__
They end up being off by 1 in the 7th place.
They get broken link notifications and other various emails.
They get matched as: -exported_symbols_list file -Wl,exported_symbols_list file -Wl,exported_symbols_list,file
They must go to the beginning of the list so that the dependency generation works as expected in ninja.
They refer to existing columns on a row, but in the case of insert the row doesn't exist yet.
They should be the same
They should generate the "right thing" whether we have specified a custom form, the fields argument, or nothing at all.
They should just have the same code, and everything will be all right.
They were not compared with any external reference.
They were taken from the Python3 standard library and adapted for use in Python2.
They will be fully expanded by recursion in ExpandVariables.
They're algorithmic so good candidates for unittesting by themselves
They're displayed in the last row of the form, directly after that row's form element.
They're implemented on demand.
They're populated with content from Monty Python and the Holy Grail.
They're pretty large, so don't hog disk space.
They're products, not sources.
They're the same, no more caching.
They're three ways of saying the same thing.
Thicken the zero contour.
Things that look like escaped characters shouldn't occur outside of strings and chars.
Things we pull in from all backends
Things without _meta aren't functional models, so they're uninteresting parents.
Third Wednesday in January 2011
Third argument, if non-zero, makes it do POSTBUILDS processing.
Third tuple is the start and end indexes of the last page.
Third, for LinearSegmentedColormap only, leave everything to register_cmap:

This DataSource object is not accessible outside this scope.
This Experiment is only included in the test data when the DB supports microsecond precision.
This LayerMapping should work b/c `strict` is not set.
This Price instance generated by this form is not valid because the quantity field is required, but the form is valid because the field is excluded from the form.
This RE is a little bit more complicated than one might expect, because we have to take care of space removals tools so we can handle comments inside statements better.
This URLs file is used to provide a reliable view deployment for test purposes.
This a short id that's used in the webpage urls
This adds time to parsing but speeds up code completion.
This algorithm can only handle fully exploded IP strings

This allows for correct identification (later) of the actual template that does not exist.
This allows for correct identification of the actual template that does not exist.
This allows for more complex queries than filter() and exclude() alone would allow
This allows for proper grouping.
This allows idempotence of command executions.
This allows individual applications to respond as if the database had been migrated from scratch.
This allows interactive changing of the colormap.
This allows multiple renderers to share the cached fonts, but only one figure can draw at at time and so the font cache is used by only one renderer at a time
This allows older versions of scipy to test without a flood of messages.
This allows operations to be done on fields in the SELECT, overriding their values -- used by the Oracle and MySQL spatial backends to get database values as WKT, and by the `transform` method.
This allows other functions here to be used by pytest-based testing suites without requiring nose to be installed.
This allows overriding everything if need be.
This allows people to easily run their modified code on the remote machine to see how changes will affect it.

This also applies to interactive panning and zooming in the GUI interfaces.
This also had a bug with many arrays (see gh-5979).
This also has pros and cons.
This also holds for the same integers scaled by powers of two.
This also means scaling the transform just slightly to account for the extra subpixel.

This also tests that the subspace buffer is initialized:
This also tests type_tuple_type_resolver.
This also works if you assign the FK in the constructor
This also works if you assign the O2O relation in the constructor
This app isn't migrated, but something depends on it.
This argument is passed when run from the gclient hooks.
This argument is used to establish that the BookManager is actually getting used when it should be.
This arrangement means that a "conditions" section containing a "variables" section will only have those variables effective in subdicts, not in the_dict.
This attack is based on the way browsers handle URLs.
This attempts to run the module in-process (by importing a main function and then calling it).
This automatically behaves like an OR evaluation of the multiple variables.
This automatically resets the flow_indent if there was a dedent or a flow just on one line (with one simple_stmt).
This avoids a query on the related model for every deferred field.
This avoids the problem with flipping the array, which results in a copy when it is converted to contiguous in the C wrapper
This avoids the same computation in generate_removed_indexes() and generate_added_indexes().
This avoids these false positives: - macro that defines a base class - multi-line macro that defines a base class - macro that defines the whole class-head
This backend doesn't accept these credentials as arguments.
This backend says to stop in our tracks - this user should not be allowed in at all.
This backend was renamed in Django 1.9.
This bailout is still needed for skipping signal sending.
This behavior is only activated during a raw save - it is mostly relevant to deserialization, but any sort of CORBA style 'narrow()' API would require a similar approach.
This behavior may not be ideal, but it is what it is and we should keep track of it changing
This behavior was changed from max_num taking precedence in the patch for #20084
This benefits both the "build chrome" case as well as the gyp tests, which expect to be able to run actions and build libraries by their short name.
This bipolar color map was generated from CoolWarmFloat33.csv of "Diverging Color Maps for Scientific Visualization" by Kenneth Moreland.
This block sends information about a playbook when it starts The playbook object is not immediately available at playbook_on_start so we grab it via the play
This breaks incremental linking, and is generally overly complicated.
This builds a html page of all images from the image comparison tests and opens that page in the browser.
This bypasses any model-defined save.
This cache also might not exist if the related object hasn't been accessed yet.
This cache exists so that the database isn't queried for SRID info each time a distance query is constructed.
This caches the preamble (included files at top of source file).

This can be an ISBN number or the project homepage.
This can be made more efficient by not computing the minimum key for each iteration
This can be made more efficient by using powers of two in the usual way.

This can be whatever you want.
This can cause issues where files that were deleted from a more recent Django are still present in site-packages.
This can cause problems (see #25389).
This can go away when we add verification that all targets have the necessary configurations.
This can happen if six is removed from sys.modules and then reloaded.
This can happen in the as_p() case (and possibly others that users write): if there are only top errors, we may not be able to conscript the last row for our purposes, so insert a new, empty row.
This can happen two ways: - We are at the beginning of the class.
This can happen when we're just evaluating the playlist
This can only be the end of a non-capturing group, since all other unescaped parentheses are handled by the grouping section later (and the full group is handled there).
This can't be done in Options.contribute_to_class() because fields haven't been added to the model at that point.
This case used to fail because the ORM couldn't resolve the automatically generated annotation name `book__count`
This causes actions/rules invoked by gyp to sometimes use these instead of system versions, e.g. bison.
This causes an AttributeError when trying to resolve the view.
This causes an infinite loop under MySQL InnoDB unless we keep track of already deleted objects.
This changes the interpretation of the data region (but not the actual data), therefore the returned scalars are not the same (they are byte-swapped versions of each other).
This channel is not available.
This check duplicates that behavior.
This check filters on the desired instance states defined in the config file with the instance_states config option.
This check is a bit strange, but CompiledObject itself is a bit more complicated than we would it actually like to be.
This check is impossible only because NPY_RELAXED_STRIDES_CHECKING changes the strides actively
This check is kept for backwards-compatibility.
This check is performed only once per DatabaseWrapper instance per thread, since subsequent connections will use the same settings.
This check needs to be done here, since we can't later remove this from the method lookup table, as we do with add and remove.
This check needs to be performed out-of-process, because importing gi and then importing regular old pygtk afterward segfaults the interpreter.
This check prevents the subclass from then trying to find a subclass and create that.
This check was added because it is very easy to type `subplots(1, 2, 1)` when `subplot(1, 2, 1)` was intended.
This checks commutation, not numerical correctness
This checks if promotion of join types works for deeper nesting too.
This checks that get_prep_value is deferred properly

This code is at the end of this module to speed up module loading.
This code is part of Ansible, but is an independent component.

This combination actually never happens.
This combines the Extent and Union aggregates into one query
This comes from FloatField columns.
This comes from IntField and DecimalField columns.
This comment is here just to include a ' to unconfuse syntax highlighting.
This comment should not be extracted
This compares scalarmath against ufuncs.
This comparison invokes deprecated behaviour, and will probably start raising an error eventually.
This conditional and conversion exists to sanity check the values we're given but we may want to take it out for testing and sanitize our input instead.
This construct is somewhat of an abuse of ForeignObject.
This construct might look complicated but it allows for lazy evaluation of the queryset.
This context manager helps us avoid that situation.
This converts json strings to dictionaries, which are parsed below the same way as direct dictionary inputs.
This corresponds to second order accurate finite differences for all interior and boundary points.
This could also be used as a simple sanity check in the future, but for now the performance increase is enough to justify it, even if the server does nothing with it.
This could be a feature request for the PEP8 tool.
This could be changed, a 0-d boolean index can make sense (even outside the 0-d indexed array case) Note that originally this is could be interpreted as integer in the full integer special case.
This could be further improved by inspecting the java file for the package name if this proves to be too fragile in practice.
This could be open for changes in numpy.
This could be optimized with a cache at the expense of RAM.
This could in the future, check to see if the data is a vault blob and is encrypted with a key associated with this vault instead of just checking the format.
This creates a marker with nans in it, which was segfaulting the Agg backend (see #3722)
This creates an interface with the same name as a builtin, which hphpc doesn't correctly support AttrUnique flags on.
This currently doesn't work as the psycopg2 mogrify method that generates the ARRAY() syntax is expecting literals, not column references (#27095).
This custom encoder looks for instances of NoIndent or ChunkedIndent.
This decision is based on how they are initialized above in __init__()
This default implementation allows blit to clear the frame.
This defaults to 'epub', a theme designed to save visual space.
This delays the instantiation of the objects to the moment of evaluation of the raster attribute.
This deletes the existing categories.
This depends on both the removal/alteration of all incoming fields and the removal of all its own related fields, and if it's a through model the field that references it.
This design should probably be revisited as it increases complexity.
This designates the field indexes (1-based) of the fields that have indexes on the table.
This dict stores the download progress, it's updated by the progress hook
This dictionary allows look up based on any alias for an array data-type

This dictionary maps Field objects to their associated MySQL column types, as strings.
This dictionary maps Field objects to their associated Oracle column types, as strings.
This dictionary maps Field objects to their associated PostgreSQL column types, as strings.
This dictionary will eventually contain the request's query string parameters actually used by this filter.
This differs slightly from default Ansible execution of Python modules as it passes the arguments to the module via a file instead of stdin.
This does *not* turn on classic mode altogether.
This does not apply when the non-space character following the comma is another comma, since the only time when that happens is for empty macro arguments.
This does not inherit from TestCase to avoid any tests being run with this class, which wouldn't work, and to allow different TestCase subclasses to be used.
This does not match the characters in _escape, because those need to be backslash-escaped regardless of whether they appear in a double-quoted string.
This does not mean that there is an actual flow, it means that the INDENT is syntactically wrong.
This does not mean they need to have the same shape, but they both need to render to the same coordinate system determined by xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax.
This does not seem to be any help here global_settings.GetDefaultCamera()
This does not use has/getattr intentionally - we want to know whether we have cached the regexp for *this* class, whereas getattr would also match the superclass

This doesn't account for the database connection's timezone, which isn't known.
This doesn't catch all cases.

This doesn't integrate well with the test suite but at least it prevents regressions.
This doesn't make a copy when `value` already contains bytes.
This doesn't require running on PostgreSQL and spots the most likely error - not running YearLte SQL at all.
This doesn't support per-configuration prefix headers.
This doesn't work before django.setup() on some databases.
This doesn't work: lambda x: val(1-x) The same "val" (the first one) is used each time, so the colors are identical and the result is shades of gray.
This dollar is ok as it is escaped
This eliminates the need for temp files.
This emulates the logic in multiarray/number.c:PyArray_GenericBinaryFunction
This ensures that the earliest occurrence of the item will stay put.
This ensures that the item appears at the earliest possible position in the list.
This ensures that the rasterized content in the colorbars is only as thick as the colorbar, and doesn't extend to other parts of the image.
This ensures we don't get flooded with messages during testing (unless you really ask to be flooded).
This error is below that needed to match the RK4 integrator.
This essentially test to see if user specified labels get overwritten by the auto labeler functionality of the axes.
This example can be boiled down to a more simplistic example to show the problem, but including the upper and lower bound ellipses, it demonstrates how significant this error is to our plots.
This example is tricky because the parent could be NULL, so only checking parents with annotations omits some results (tag t1, in this case).
This example produces a so-called SkewT-logP diagram, which is a common plot in meteorology for displaying vertical profiles of temperature.
This example projection class is rather long, but it is designed to illustrate many features, not all of which will be used every time.
This exercises that case.
This expects the images to compare completely different, with a very large RMS.
This expects the images to compare equal under normal tolerance, and have a small RMS.
This expects the images to compare equal under normal tolerance, and have an RMS of exactly 1.
This extra absorption in the regexp facilitates testing the regexp on its own, by preventing the interior of some of these constructs from being treated as literal text.
This extra fuss is to re-order face / edge colors
This extra legwork is so that the dictionary definition comes out in the same order as the fields in the model definition.
This failed to get the length of the number 2, and the exception hung around until something checked PyErr_Occurred() and returned an error.
This fails if not using the highest pickling protocol on Python 2.
This falls back to interpolating in RGBA space which can produce it's own artifacts of colors not in the map showing up in the final image.
This feature is useful for F90/95 users if they use PARAMETERSs in type specifications.

This is a test setup, not a requirement for unmanaged models.
This is a tricky reduction case for the buffering double loop to handle
This is a very rare case.
This is about *rsync's connection*, not about the ansible connection to run the module.
This is about 2x faster than the implementation above on 3.2+
This is actually more efficient because boxplot converts a 2-D array into a list of vectors internally anyway.
This is actually the quoting rules for CommandLineToArgvW, not for the shell, because the shell doesn't do anything in Windows.
This is all roughly based on the Makefile system used by the Linux kernel, but is a non-recursive make -- we put the entire dependency graph in front of make and let it figure it out.
This is allowed, fall back to Qt5 using which ever binding the rparams ask for.
This is allowed, so lets try and guess what we should be using.
This is also a good select_related() test because there are multiple Note entries in the SQL.
This is also horribly broken but somewhat less so.
This is also needed in order to create the connection in order to install the hstore extension.
This is also used if you do content translation via gettext catalogs.
This is also used in the base class for strategies (ansible/plugins/strategy/__init__.py)
This is always a valid order_by field but is an alias and therefore won't be found by opts.get_field.
This is always executed on a query clone, so we can modify self.query
This is an action that doesn't make any sense.
This is an easy way for people to look at the code on the remote machine for debugging it in that environment
This is an error in the future
This is an error in the future:
This is an example of a model that imports a class that has an abstract base class.
This is an expression, let's compile it.
This is an inherited model from City
This is an optgroup, so look inside the group for options
This is an optgroup, so look inside the group for options.
This is an optimization: those are only hints, and an exhaustive search for the size is done if the hints are wrong.
This is because `QuerySet.all()` works by creating a "copy" of the current queryset and in making said copy, all the cached `prefetch_related` lookups are lost.
This is because instances on ForeignObject properties will set all related field off of the given instance
This is because powershell only works on windows but the other modules work anywhere (possibly including windows if the correct language interpreter is installed).
This is because source_remove() is not working as we want.
This is because the Android LOCAL_GENERATED_SOURCES must be in the local module intermediate directory for the compile rules to work properly.
This is because the downside for getting the whitelist wrong means some extra semicolons, while the downside for getting the blacklist wrong would result in compile errors.
This is because we check whether the arguments are iterable, and if so we try and convert them to a tuple.
This is because we use system to create tmp dirs for unprivileged users who are sudo'ing to a second unprivileged user.
This is called by three functions: __init__.py::_do_handler_run(), linear.py::run(), and free.py::run() so we'd have to add to all three to do it there.
This is certainly broken on Windows.
This is compatible with other
This is considered acceptable since we want the value in the form field (to pass into widget for example).
This is consistent to what `imshow` assumes, as well.
This is consistent with MATLAB and sometimes quite useful, but will require the user to test how many points were actually returned before using data.
This is consulted in case multiple AnsibleModules are created.
This is contrary to valid Python syntax.
This is currently useless as we only get here if we are going to substitute powershell.ps1 into the module anyway.
This is dangerous -- casts can assign to temporaries, so the pointer doesn't point where you think.
This is dangerous because the C++ language does not guarantee that globals with constructors are initialized before the first access.
This is default behavior.
This is defined here as a do-nothing function because we can't import django.utils.translation -- that module depends on the settings.
This is different from new_frame_seq() to give the ability to save 'live' generated frame information to be saved later.
This is done after variable expansion so that conditions may take advantage of expanded variables.
This is done as a check when get_host() is invoked, but we check here as a practical consequence.
This is done as a property to ensure that the fully resolved value is returned.
This is done by identifying all tables that have their primary key included in the grouped columns and removing non-primary key columns referring to them.
This is done by repeatedly iterating over the input list of models.
This is done here to the defaults dictionary as opposed to the other two dictionaries because we do want to capture when a *user* explicitly specifies a marker which should be an error.
This is done here, rather than on the field, because the field does not have access to the initial value
This is done if allmatch is False.
This is done in a second loop such that the header of the embedded eps file is not modified.
This is done in a separate loop up front, because the _included and _excluded keys need to be added to the_dict, and that can't be done while iterating through it.
This is done in order to keep the scene output and non-scene output code DRY
This is done in reverse order since the first choice should take precedence.
This is done to avoid some false positives with shifts.
This is done to ensure that for Python2 only, defining metaclasses still does not fail to create the model.
This is done to make it easy to build source paths.
This is done to more closely match the depth-first method used by DeepDependencies.
This is done with an exception rather than the default argument on pop because we don't want get_default() to be evaluated, and then not used.
This is dubious (see below):
This is due to the fact that the new code always uses "nonzero" logic and the boolean special case is not taken.
This is duplicated from setup.py
This is enough, because every name points to it.
This is exactly representable in floating point
This is executed in autocommit mode so that code in run_select_for_update can see this data.
This is expected to fail because the savepoint no longer exists.
This is falling back to the default value exposed by python-memcached on my system.
This is faster than an algorithm based on linalg.lstsq.
This is filed as Apple radar 6588391.
This is for backwards compat.
This is for backwards compatibility.
This is for backwards-compatibility: RequestContexts created via Context.new don't include values from context processors.
This is for efficiency and scripts should still return data if called with --host for backwards compat with 1.2 and earlier.
This is handled by including a skew component to the basic Axes transforms.
This is handled transparently, though.
This is hard because User defines equality in a non-duck-typing way See bug #12060
This is here for convienience since it is done in several locations.
This is horribly broken in multiple ways.
This is how the admin system's edit inline functionality works.
This is how you are officially supposed to set SO_REUSEADDR per https://docs.python.org/2/library/socketserver.html#SocketServer.BaseServer.allow_reuse_address
This is important because paths will be used as keys to the data dict and for references between input files.
This is important to make pages cacheable.
This is important, as the contains method can only work when a renderer exists.
This is intended for executable, shared_library and loadable_module targets where every configuration is set up to produce a PDB output.
This is intended to be used very sparingly.
This is intentional and a limitation of the current C code.
This is interpolated into the hostname pattern below.
This is janky as all get out, but hopefully boilerplate will be retired soon.
This is just a smoke test.
This is just an app - no model qualifier
This is just an example for testing purposes...
This is just an extra-careful check, just in case there is some edge-case I haven't thought of.
This is just here to clarify.
This is just naive way of doing and my fail for some cases.
This is just used to produce an image to feed to BboxImage
This is kind of optimization - if user told us destination is dir, do path manipulation right away, otherwise we still check for dest being a dir via remote call below.
This is larger than the limit but should still be kept.
This is like backtracking: Get the first possible result.
This is made non-trivial because of the interaction between text rotation and alignment - text alignment is based on the bbox after rotation.
This is mainly only useful for ad-hoc command line operation as in playbooks one would assume variables would be used appropriately
This is meant to be used with smoothing layer elements.
This is meant to silence warnings for conditional includes.
This is more or less an assert, see #18247
This is much faster than having Path do it one at a time.
This is necessary as someone may be using PSQL without extensions installed but be using other features of contrib.postgres.
This is necessary as the other dependencies on them may be static libraries themselves, which are not compile time dependencies.
This is necessary as the shareability is disabled by default in pysqlite and it cannot be changed once a connection is opened.
This is necessary because the tag lets the length of loopvars differ to the length of each set of items and we don't want to leave any vars from the previous loop on the context.
This is necessary, because `reversed` is a function and autocompletion would fail in certain cases like `reversed(x).__iter__` if we just returned the result directly.
This is needed because bisect does not take a comparison function.
This is needed for some VC++ compilers.
This is needed on the Ansible control machine to be reasonably efficient with connections.
This is needed to cut chunks of band data out of PostGIS raster strings when decomposing them into GDALRasters.
This is needed to don't have tall matrix have the diagonal wrap.
This is needed, or bytes will be numpy.random.bytes from "from numpy.random import *" above
This is no longer used as numpy.ones_like, however it is still used by some internal calls.
This is non-reversible, but we shouldn't blow up when parsing it.
This is not "proper" anyway.
This is not a "problem" in Python, because the code is never called.
This is not a complete expression and cannot be used in GROUP BY.
This is not a real file.
This is not a real id, it can be for example AJT for the news http://www.arte.tv/guide/fr/emissions/AJT/arte-journal
This is not a relational field, so further parts must be transforms.
This is not an error that should be printed.
This is not an existing Import statement.
This is not as accurate as reverse recursion in this application but it is more efficient.
This is not clearly defined otherwise
This is not currently optimized with a dict as GetChildByPath is because it has few callers.
This is not currently working on Linux and is untested elsewhere.
This is not documented behavior however.
This is not entirely bad, because the mouse position relative to the canvas is changing, but it may be surprising to get repeated entries without leaves
This is not expected to be much of a problem in practice.
This is not ideal, users may intend the ink to not be centered.
This is not infinite-recursion proof.
This is not necessary on unix, where os.environ is encoded using the surrogateescape error handler and decoded using it as part of spawn.
This is not necessary to preserve.
This is not quite right, as it also protects these for actions, not just for rules where they are valid.
This is not the expected exception
This is not the proper way to do relative imports.
This is not theoretically optimal, but works well enough.
This is not true for static libraries, but currently the env is only written for bundles:
This is not wanted behavior, but this is how Django has always behaved for databases that do not return correct information about matched rows for UPDATE.
This is ok, since people are almost never interested in variations.
This is okay in general.
This is only an issue if it contains unescaped non-ASCII characters, which URIs should not.
This is only available when using MySQL 5.6, or when using MyISAM tables.
This is only false for py2.7, even on py3.5...
This is only non-None temporarily during the execution of some methods.
This is only the first part of the login process.
This is only triggered if both sides are missing spaces, even though technically should flag if at least one side is missing a space.
This is only used if we don't know how many frames there will be: in the case of no generator or in the case of a callable.
This is only useful for tests
This is order preserving, since self.extra_select is an OrderedDict.
This is part of rtmpdump's normal usage, AFAIK.
This is particularly useful for polygons with holes.
This is perhaps a little bit roundabout to make a new class on the fly like this, but it means that a new Subplot class does not have to be created for every type of Axes.
This is probably due to YouTube measures against IP ranges of hosting providers.
This is probably much larger than necessary.
This is provided for backward compatibility
This is purposely using the 2D Axes's set_xlim and set_ylim, because we are trying to place our viewing pane.
This is questionable, but currently a numpy scalar can be output to a zero dimensional array.
This is really ESRI format, not WKT -- but the import should work the same
This is required as a workaround for an  edge case in MySQL: if the same connection is used to create tables, load data, and query, the query can return incorrect results.
This is required by GDAL.
This is required to ensure the value is tested for change correctly when determine what extra forms have changed to save.
This is safe because multiple calls to `install_repl_displayhook` are no-ops and the registered function respect `mpl.is_interactive()` to determine if they should trigger a draw.
This is safe since we always provide a default of 3.8.0
This is safe to ignore.
This is separate from _run() because we need to do the same thing for stdout and stderr.
This is set by --linelength flag.
This is set by --root flag.
This is similar to what Repository.open would do.
This is simply YouTube
This is simply a custom list filter class.
This is simply a field name, so use the default FieldListFilter class that has been registered for the type of the given field.
This is slightly complicated, so worth an explanation.
This is slightly kludgy, but seems to work.
This is slow so is not uncommented by default.
This is so that np.array(True) is not accepted in a full integer index, when running the file separately.
This is so the string pointer can be freed within Python.
This is something that could be fixed later on.
This is special processing that applies on platforms that don't deal with git symlinks -- probably only MS windows.
This is strictly unnecessary for correctness, it's only to verify that e.g. /MANIFESTDEPENDENCY was not used in a #pragma comment.
This is taken care of by GraphicsContextPdf.
This is temporary workaround to reduce burst of bug reports until we figure out the reason and whether it can be fixed at all.
This is tested directly on _key_to_file, as load() will swallow a SuspiciousOperation in the same way as an IOError - by creating a new session, making it unclear whether the slashes were detected.
This is tested here, with a do-nothing command that fails if the presence of fileno() is assumed in exec_command.
This is the Mobius mapping, taking a u, v pair and returning an x, y, z triple
This is the base class of the exception.
This is the base table (first FROM entry) - this table isn't really joined at all in the query, so we should not alter its join type.
This is the canonical way to emulate LIMIT and OFFSET on Oracle.
This is the core of pad ...
This is the default encoding, but it doesn't hurt to be explicit

This is the reason this function can't be integrated into the rest of the code.
This is the return type used by binary output (WKB, HEX) routines.
This is the same as "attname", except if db_column is specified.
This is the same as "name", except in the case of ForeignKeys, where "_id" is appended.
This is the same as Cursor.get_children minus an assert in visitor().
This is the same as in the default project template
This is the scaling that occurs automatically for all images on a HiDPI display.
This is the script defining the ShowTooltip and HideTooltip functions.
This is the second trip through ITERATING_SETUP, so we clear the flag and move onto the next block in the list while setting the run state to ITERATING_TASKS
This is the sort order used by Xcode.
This is the structure of the table used for plain objects:
This is the thread-local connection, not the main connection.
This is the transform for latitude ticks.
This is the transform for longitude ticks.
This is the transform for r-axis ticks.
This is the transform for theta-axis ticks.
This is the version of FreeType to use when building a local version.
This is the websocket client that will actually talk with meteor
This is therefore not a proper argument clinic implementation.
This is tightly coupled to the implementation, but it's the most straightforward way to test the key.
This is to allow overriding the default filters for certain types of fields with some custom filters.
This is to avoid adding struct arguments to the nesting stack.
This is to handle the case where the test DB doesn't exist, in which case we need to create it, then just not destroy it.
This is to prevent a spurious 'unexected unindent' warning from docutils when the original docstring was blank.
This is typically used when parsing headers.
This is ugly, and a hack, but it makes things better than the alternative of predictability.
This is used by external sites like Weibo
This is used for error messages if further parsing fails due to an unclosed block tag.
This is used in the admin for save_as functionality.
This is used only by copy()
This is used to pack and unpack the pixel values of PostGIS raster bands.
This is useful if the translation unit will be reparsed and you don't want to incur the overhead of reparsing the preamble.
This is useful if you only care about searching for declarations/definitions.
This is useful if you want to factor out common information for programming purposes, but still completely independent separate models at the database level.
This is useful under some testing situations and should never be used on a live site.
This is very common for TV series.
This is very difficult.
This is very specific, so using the fragile module filter is fine
This is what we keep after the #endif.
This is when the error occurs.
This is where we actually say we are starting a play
This is where we add self - if it has never been instantiated.
This is written in such a way that it'll always pass on platforms without threading.
This is wrong for Django websites where UTF-8 is the default.
This isn't a big issue as it is not actually used once the contour has been calculated.
This isn't a raw save because: 1) we're testing inheritance, not field behavior, so none of the field values need to be protected.
This isn't a real primary/replica database, so restore the original from other
This isn't necessary on Windows since the Windows version of abspath handles this correctly.
This isn't strictly necessary, but it makes some of the code more readable (and provides a backwards compatible Polar API)
This isolates the decision of what the system default is, so calling code can do "feedgenerator.DefaultFeed" instead of "feedgenerator.Rss201rev2Feed".
This isolates the final return value so that it isn't misattributed to the last stage.
This issue can happen if the value of 'list_filter' refers to a 'through__field'.
This item matches an exclude regex, so set its value to 0 (exclude).
This item matches an include regex, so set its value to 1 (include).
This item matches the exclude_item, so set its action to 0 (exclude).
This just checks that the uploaded data is JSON
This keeps the file writer from outputting something that would be treated as the end of a comment in the middle of something intended to be entirely a comment.
This keeps the model field from raising a required error.
This lead to wrong sorting.
This leads to problems when the ansible module masks a python library that another import needs.
This lets us pop a frame at the top of the loop, which makes it easier to include the final frame.
This lets us skip creating migrations for the test models as many of them depend on one of the following contrib applications.
This lets us test changes in username datatype, and non-text required fields.
This letter is removed from the final output.
This light wrapper "fakes" a dictionary interface, because some SQLite data types include variables in them -- e.g. "varchar(30)" -- and can't be matched as a simple dictionary lookup.
This limit is defined by Google.
This limit is important (for all integrators) to avoid the trajectory skipping some mask cells.
This line will raise an Exception if prompt contains unencoded non-ASCII on Python 2.
This list is expanded on demand.
This list is not exhaustive, but that's okay.
This list may contain strings to create section headers for the display.

This loads the GDAL/OGR C library
This logic is added to the end of the cmd at the bottom of this function.
This logic is list-specific, but since it relies on the associated dict key, it's checked in this dict-oriented function.
This looks a little crazy, but it's the equivalent of what the admin interface has to do for the edit-inline case.
This looks pretty good, and was fairly painless, but you can get that cut-out diagonal lines look with just a bit more work.
This looks weird and useless, but the object in question has a custom __eq__
This loop adds the names of the self object, copies them and removes the self.
This makes a new class that inherits from SubplotBase and the given axes_class (which is assumed to be a subclass of Axes).
This makes indent at the first position possible.
This makes it easier to write generic path based code.
This makes it possible to have captured parameters in the parent URLconf pattern.
This makes it possible to pickle non-toplevel ufuncs such as scipy.special.expit for instance.
This makes life easier, and is probably required for backwards compatibility with external tests against admin views.
This makes quite a few things in Jedi's fast parser possible.
This makes sense for autocompletion and static analysis.
This makes sense in a meteorological mode of thinking since there 0 degrees corresponds to north (the y-axis traditionally)
This makes the definition of 'results' more readable.
This makes the original colorbar look a bit out of place, so let's improve its position.
This makes unit testing a bit easier and more readable.
This manager should be used for queries on related fields so that geometry columns on Oracle and MySQL are selected properly.
This manifest serves as a way for me to map a mesh node to the object nodes that are using it.
This maps field names (not columns) for things like unique_together
This matches a square-bracketed expression with a port specification.
This matches an IPv4 address, but also permits range expressions.
This matches an IPv6 address, but also permits range expressions.
This matches the requested mod_type
This may be an abuse of polygons here to render what is essentially maybe 1 triangle and a series of lines.
This may be common, so avoid the call.
This may be done in gyp files to force certain includes to come at the end.
This may be unrecognized because it's an exclusion list.
This may change the properties of the chosen random sequence slightly, but this is better than absolute predictability.
This may happen when users put an IP entry into their inventory, or if they rely on DNS for a non-inventory hostname
This may happen with CompFor.
This may not have been checked above if merging in a list with an extension character.
This may occur in situations such as when ax.transAxes is passed through for absolute positioning.
This may produce invalid links sometimes (e.g. http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/suicide-plan)
This may result in the callbacks being hit twice, but ensures they are hit at least once
This may seem a little strange, but later we will show how to require a minimum number of forms to be completed.
This may turn c into a non-string, so we check again below.
This means it reads expiration values as aware or naive datetimes, depending on the value of USE_TZ and whether the database supports time zones.
This means not only that the linker should not generate the intermediate manifest but also that the manifest tool should do nothing even when additional manifests are specified.
This means shared_library uses --whole-archive, while loadable_module doesn't.
This means that a vertex will have as many mapping coordinates as polygons of which it is a part.
This means that all variables in .mk-files clobber one another, and furthermore that any variables set potentially clash with other Android build system variables.
This means that all variables in .mk-files clobber one another.
This means that if you have a classmethod and a field with the same name, then such fields can't be deferred (we don't have a check for this).
This means that one cannot add both "foo:22" and "foo:23" to the inventory.
This means that the _meta._relation_tree is only called if related_objects is not in __dict__.
This means that the following works (and returns False) due to dtype mismatch:
This means that the parser is empty.
This means that we have to switch to absolute timestamps.
This means the delimiter and the next list item that follow this one in the .vcproj file will be misinterpreted as part of this item.
This means we shouldn't continue...raise an error.
This means we will not check single-line class definitions.
This mess below finds the best xattr tool for the job

This method name doesn't begin with "test" to prevent test discovery from seeing it.
This method returns True if all configurations in target contain a 'SYMROOT' attribute that is unique for the given target.
This method should be named "as_mysql" for MySQL, "as_postgresql" for postgres and so on, but as we don't know which DB we are running on, we need to use setattr.
This method should be refactored to avoid relying on state.apps (#27310).
This method takes a field name and returns the prefixed field, according to self.prefix.
This method will handle the delegation to the correct type

This mimics Xcode behavior by wrapping the comment in "/*" and "*/".
This mishandles IPv6 addresses, and is retained only for backwards compatibility.
This model is used to test a duplicate query regression (#25685)
This model looks like the new model and is used for teardown.
This module always tracks it as an object, but contains a hack to prevent it from printing the comment in the project file output.
This module should be used for functions both in numpy and scipy if you want to use the numpy version if available but the scipy version otherwise.
This moved 'mark' in the 'default' database, move it back in 'other'
This multiplies all the default labels by 100, making them all percentages
This must be a TransactionTestCase because the WSGI auth handler performs its own transaction management.
This must check the unexpanded includes list:
This must come after 'select', 'ordering', and 'distinct' -- see docstring of get_from_clause() for details.
This must come before int because bools are also ints
This must come first so the backend's owner is set correctly
This must fail since complete video-audio format does not match filter and extractor does not provide incomplete only formats (i.e. only video-only or audio-only).
This must match the value in `setupext.py`
This name gets put at the end of the template name list so that user-supplied names override the automatically- generated ones.
This necessarily pokes at the SQL string for the query, since the duplicate problems are only apparent at that late stage.
This needs to be done in any case to clip the figure right.
This needs to be fixed in the C implementation of dtype().
This needs to be in a try/except block because the default implemenation of this method is to raise NotImplementedError
This needs to be overridden in child classes.
This needs to be the very first thing to use distribute
This needs to pass a file name to load for the test.
This needs to test a function that has keywords but no func_code attribute, since otherwise vectorize will inspect the func_code.
This normally comes from a mathematical expression in the SELECT list.
This number is increased whenever a change is made to the C-API -- whether it breaks binary compatibility or not.
This number is increased whenever the C-API is changed such that binary compatibility is broken, i.e. whenever a recompile of extension modules is needed.
This object is now relative to that variable, so it has no path attribute of its own.
This object retains its existing id and parent attributes.
This object understands how to convert a path to a file, and also how to handle None.
This occurs when rule outputs from distinct inputs are interdependent.
This one has already a mask....
This one is aware of rmin
This one is not aware of rmin
This one is triggering http://bugs.python.org/issue20747, that is Python will itself insert a newline in the header

This one only accepts pointers to floats
This one should wrap error groups in the customized way.
This only becomes a problem when the order_by introduces a new join.

This partial takes a single optional argument named "sender".
This particularly prevents that an empty value is cached while cloning.
This pattern is used to determine when a string can be printed unquoted.

This use-case is useful for REPL.
This used to be two fold, but if fancy indexing was active, the check was done later, possibly after broadcasting it away (1.7.
This used to segfault:
This uses a method described here:
This uses mathtext to render the expression

This will never be a valid encoded hash
This will not change vmin, vmax if they are already set.

Tk after() is only a single shot, so we need to add code here to reset the timer if we're not operating in single shot mode.
Tk doesn't provide a way to choose a default filetype, so we just have to put it first
To achieve this in memcache backends, a negative timeout must be passed.
To achieve this we limit data_len to _TEST_FILE_SIZE and manually control block size when downloading a file.

To avoid a constraint error, delete the entry before constraints are checked after the test.
To avoid calling configuration if there are any errors or help request in command in the line.
To avoid dict-ordering related errors check only one lookup in single assert.
To avoid discretization error, use either this number or a large number such as the default (256).
To avoid issues with with the `parser.Parser`, we need setters that do nothing, because if pickle comes along and sets those values.
To avoid making multiple requests per zone we list all nodes and then filter the results
To avoid returning an instance of a subclass, this function returns `bytes(value)`.
To avoid reusing another user's session, create a new, empty session if the existing session corresponds to a different authenticated user.
To avoid the name collision, we use different names.
To avoid the problem entirely, we disallow users from adding users if they don't have change permission.
To avoid the problem, put in a quick sleep, which guarantees that there will be a time difference.
To avoid this fully the hook would have to avoid all python api calls, e.g. by being implemented in C like python 3.4's tracemalloc module
To avoid this problem, we mark the models as unmanaged, and temporarily revert them to managed during each test.
To avoid this we suppress warnings.
To avoid unnecessary changes to the project file after Xcode opens it, don't write comments for remoteGlobalIDString.
To avoid unnecessary persistent storage accesses, we set up the internals directly (loading data wastes time, since we are going to set it to an empty dict anyway).

Warnings and Exceptions
Warp the raster into new srid
Was once Kaltura embed
We (possibly) need to convert object IDs to the type of the instances' PK in order to match up instances:
We *could* pass in a queryset to restrict the Author objects we edit, but in this case we'll use it to display them in alphabetical order by name.
We actually allow both "foo" and "foo_id".
We add back in all of the non-compilable stuff to make sure that the make rules have dependencies on them.
We add csrf_protect here so this function can be used as a utility function for any view, without having to repeat 'csrf_protect'.
We add the group anyway, but make a note in pending_declarations to check at the end.
We added this journal field
We aim for a message size which will fit 4 messages into the cookie, but not 5.
We allow some, but not all, declarations of variables to be present in the statement that defines the class.
We also add "magic" variables back into the variables dict to make sure a certain subset of variables exist.
We also add some asserts to give better error messages in case people are using other ways to call cache_page that no longer work.
We also cache the result to prevent the subsequent call when the ufunc is evaluated.
We also catch users warnings here.
We also check "if" blocks here, since an empty conditional block is likely an error.
We also check for the case where the previous line is indented 6 spaces, which may happen when the initializers of a constructor do not fit into a 80 column line.
We also do it here, because the recursive nature of helper methods means we may be loading nested includes, and we want the include order printed correctly
We also need to add special handling for SafeText and SafeBytes as MySQLdb's type checking is too tight to catch those (see Django ticket #6052).
We also need to move over any C++ files that don't match our local_cpp_extension, since Android will only generate Makefile rules for a single LOCAL_CPP_EXTENSION.
We also set the Territory to 'AMERICA' which forces Sunday to evaluate to a '1' in TO_CHAR().
We also set them to use the same tables as the "reference" models to avoid errors when other tests run 'migrate' (proxy_models_inheritance does).
We also test interpolation inside a  flat triangle, by forcing *tri_index* in a call to :meth:`_interpolate_multikeys`.
We also want to prevent advancing the cycler if there are no defaults needed after ignoring the given properties.
We also want to prevent the add, change, and delete views from leaking a disallowed field value.
We also work here to make the flag the same color as the rest of the barb by default
We always build CMake 2.8.8, so no need to do anything if the directory already exists.

We are in the first checked line
We are making a thick green line as a zero contour.
We are not actually interested in it for normal cases, but need the cookies in order to be able to download the info webpage
We are on the import.
We are outside a packet
We are seeing this user for the first time in this session, attempt to authenticate the user.
We are still keeping the less descriptive message because if lhs or rhs gets long, the error message might become unreadable.
We are testing if wrong objects get deleted due to using wrong field value in m2m queries.
We are using an ugly brute-force method: clearing and redrawing the whole thing.
We assume it is all in self.args.
We assume that objects retrieved are homogeneous (which is the premise of prefetch_related), so what applies to first object applies to all.
We avoid looking for values if either ct_id or fkey value is None
We borrow heavily from the kernel build setup, though we are simpler since we don't have Kconfig tweaking settings on us.
We buffer requests line by line and move them into the allocation trace when a new line occurs
We build the url we will use to get the final track url This url is build in Bandcamp in the script download_bunde_*.js
We build up a list of every single one of the targets so we can slurp in the generated dependency rule Makefiles in one pass.
We cache this because we call this function multiple times (compiler.fill_related_selections, query.iterator)
We calculate number of rows in each column.
We calculate state separately in here since our state functions aren't useful
We call private method that gives back all visible accessibility children for view
We call the path from the source root to the gyp file the "base directory" within the per-.gyp-file NinjaWriter code.
We can access its attributes as normal, and we don't have access to the dict that it returns when called.
We can accomplish this by using the empty_permitted argument to a form constructor.
We can accomplish this with form prefixes.
We can achieve the same thing by filtering for the case where the reporter is None.
We can also create a formset that is tied to a parent model.
We can also display more than 1 empty form passing min_num argument
We can also display more than 1 empty form passing min_num argument to formset_factory.
We can also do the above query using UTF-8 strings.
We can also increment through all of the fields attached to this feature.
We can also prefill a FormSet with existing data by providing an ``initial`` argument to the constructor.
We can also set the file's metadata via the PdfPages object:
We can also use the Article manager through an Author object.
We can always cast types with generic units (corresponding to NaT) to more specific types
We can build a direct link to the song
We can check whether the task is no_log but the argument spec can't be because that is only run on the target machine and we haven't run it thereyet at this time.
We can confirm that the doodad has been called
We can do this by passing the key_salt and our base key through a pseudo-random function and SHA1 works nicely.
We can end up here when saving a model in inheritance chain where update_fields doesn't target any field in current model.
We can even have proxies of proxies (and subclass of those).
We can filter on attribute relationships on same model obj, e.g. find companies where the number of employees is greater than the number of chairs.
We can grab them assuming bitrates to be default.
We can have one of action, local_action, or module specified action
We can just fill out one of the forms.
We can only have one '::' shortener.
We can only insert the line directive at a line break
We can only reuse the objects if the presence of fill and stroke (and the amount of alpha for each) is the same for all of them
We can only safely pad the original axis length, to keep the period of the reflections consistent.
We can perform arithmetic operations in expressions Make sure we have 2 spare chairs
We can perform kwarg queries across m2m relationships
We can postpone the injection of internal padding, as the item appears at most once
We can probably remove this branch, it is here for use while testing
We can provide a custom queryset to our InlineFormSet:
We can retrieve the answers related to a particular object, in the order they were created, once we have a particular object.
We can retrieve the ordering of the queryset from a particular item.
We can reuse self.children to append or squash the node other.
We can safely assume there is only one as we don't get to the direct value branch otherwise.
We can safely pop the build_file_data from per_process_data because it will never be referenced by this process again, so we don't need to keep it in the cache.
We can send it to the bottom using the last letter of the alphabet 'z'.
We can set one field to have the value of another field Make sure we have enough chairs
We can set the Django TZ to something else so that UTC, Django's TIME_ZONE, and the system timezone are all different.
We can set this from both an attribute and per call
We can simply ignore them since they're either empty line or doesn't find executable lines of the given file.
We can skip References to select clause, as all expressions in the select clause are already part of the group by.
We can skip the transform since the circle has no preferred orientation
We can squash the other node's children directly into this node.
We can still add a colorbar for the image, too.
We can still use `select_related()` to include related models in our querysets.
We can suppress output on the management command
We can take the first element, because only the os special case yields multiple modules, which is not important for further imports.
We can then reverse the result of the topological sort at the end.
We can use .exists() to check that there are some
We can use the fast fromfile() function.
We can use the management command to create a superuser
We can use the management command to create a superuser We skip validation because the temporary substitution of the swappable User model messes with validation.
We can't access ``my_doodad.value`` in the template, because ``my_doodad.__call__`` will be invoked first, yielding a dictionary without a key ``value``.
We can't access `s_code' for whatever reason---maybe it's gotten corrupted somehow.
We can't ask the user, so act like the user aborted.
We can't ask the user, so set as not provided.
We can't assume much about the ID's created, except that the above created IDs must exist.
We can't be sure that these were actually Nuclide dumps, but they're temporary anyway.
We can't compare directly for NaN, since it is never equal to itself.
We can't compare results directly (since different databases sort NULLs to different ends of the ordering), but we can check that all results are returned.
We can't do much here: - find it in python main dir - in system32, - ortherwise (Sxs), I don't know how to get it.
We can't do the delete using subquery.
We can't do this caching at the point where it is used (in task_executor) because that is post-fork and therefore would be discarded after every task.
We can't do this for LEFT JOINs because we would miss those rows that have nothing on the outer side.
We can't just use lexicographic ordering in this check because then (1, 2, 1, 'gamma') inadvertently passes the version test.
We can't just use the project filename sans path, since there could be multiple projects with the same base name (for example, foo/unittest.vcproj and bar/unittest.vcproj).
We can't optimize across `other`.
We can't pickle the C Image cached object.
We can't proxy this method through the `QuerySet` like we do for the rest of the `QuerySet` methods.
We can't rely on __mro__ directly because we only want to flatten abstract models and not the whole tree.
We can't rename it to include the browser name or create a subclass like we do with the remaining browsers as it would either duplicate tests or prevent pickling of its instances.
We can't reuse the same join again in the query.
We can't simply concatenate messages since they might require their associated parameters to be expressed correctly which is not something `format_lazy` does.
We can't simply silence the warning on first sight of closing brace, because that would cause false negatives for things that are not initializer lists.
We can't simply unapply the migrations here because there is no implicit cast from VARCHAR to INT on the database level.
We can't subset all OpenType fonts, so switch to Type 42 in that case.
We can't test the DEFAULT_TABLESPACE and DEFAULT_INDEX_TABLESPACE settings because they're evaluated when the model class is defined.
We can't use "isinstance" here, because then we'd end up importing webagg unconditiionally.
We can't use 'frommethod', as 'transpose' doesn't take keywords
We can't use 'frommethod', it whine about some parameters.
We can't use 'frommethod', the order of arguments is different
We can't use _frommethods here, as N.resize is notoriously whiny.
We can't use displayname as it also includes the arguments.
We can't use is_secure() or get_host() because response.request is a dictionary, not an HttpRequest
We can't use isinstance, as the DistributionWithoutHelpCommands class is local to a function in setuptools.command.easy_install
We can't use strftime() because it produces locale-dependent results, so we have to map english month and day names manually
We cannot add paths with dots, because that would collide with the sepatator dots for nested packages.
We cannot alter between m2m and concrete fields
We cannot currently pickle the callables in the registry, so return an empty dictionary.
We cannot reliably check this for backends like Oracle which consider NULL and '' to be equal (and thus set up character-based fields a little differently).
We cannot simply use assertRaises because a SkipTest exception will go unnoticed
We cannot synchronize the two threads with an event here because the main thread locks.
We capture the arguments to make returning them trivial
We categorize each error message we print.
We check declaration AND type because that's how distutils does it.
We check for equality with a tolerance of 10e-5 which is a lower bound of the precisions of ref_line coordinates
We check here rather than inside ProcessLine so that we see raw lines rather than "cleaned" lines.
We check if a string was passed to `fields` or `exclude`, which is likely to be a mistake where the user typed ('foo') instead of ('foo',)
We check if we can convert the value using the current function
We check see if the generated ps file is in landscape and return this information.
We check specifically for win_ping here, otherwise the code would look for ping.ps1
We check that all the formats have the format and format_id fields
We check to see if the options have the attribute, as it is not always added via the CLI
We choose to make a local version of putmask rather than of copyto because the latter includes more functionality than the former.
We classify each include statement as one of those 5 types using a number of techniques.
We connect receiver here and not in unit test code because we need to connect receiver before test runner creates database.
We constrain the pattern not to pick things like DocidForPrintf(foo).
We contain Python objects so we cannot write out the data directly.
We convert the audio (lossy)
We convert to a dict here.
We could also add ticks at t, but that seems to usually be uninteresting.
We could calculate the src in a more complicated way to make caching here possible as well.
We could directly use ndarray.__getitem__ on self.
We could do len(BLOCK_TAG_START) to be more "correct", but we've hard-coded the 2s here for performance.
We could end up here with NO_RECEIVERS even if we do check this case in .send() prior to calling _live_receivers() due to concurrent .send() call.
We could end up writing out parameters with unicode characters so we need to specify an encoding for the python source file
We could issue a warning here, but it probably resulted in a compiler error already.
We could optimize by only converting up to 4000 bytes here
We could relax this condition if we use the code which is commented out below to increment the location gradually.
We could skip this call if keepdb is True, but we instead give it the keepdb param.
We could try to force a reshape, but that wouldn't work in some cases.
We could try to override the global cache, but then people will still use direct imports, so we go with a documentation approach instead.
We could use a single polygon collection for filled contours, but it seems better to keep line and filled contours similar, with one collection per level.
We could use perhaps additional logic here to see if some children could be used for pushdown here.
We could use six.moves.builtins here, but that seems to do a little more than just this.
We could use some of these to add additional capabilities, I suppose, but they might not have parity with other platforms then.
We couldn't do this earlier, because settings weren't available.
We couldn't find it: the name must have been dropped
We couldn't find it: the name must have been dropped,
We create a global variable `container` that stores the patches id belonging to each histogram.
We create a huge list of all the elements of the file.
We create a writer manually so that we can get the appropriate size for the tag
We create all class-instances
We currently set the primary keys on the objects when using PostgreSQL via the RETURNING ID clause.
We defer variable evaluation to the lambda to ensure that terms are lazily evaluated using Python's boolean parsing logic.
We define the masked singleton as a float for higher precedence.
We demote it back to INNER join (in AND case a single vote is enough).
We did try to do the wrapping the smart way, with callable functions and new.function, but could never get the docstrings right for python2.2.
We didn't find a lookup.
We didn't find the current field, so move position back one step.
We didn't find the files, so build them
We didn't keep up with the live window.
We disable host name validation here so we can ping the server endpoint using localhost.
We disable this so that the severity can be better reflected in the UI.
We do a little shimmy so that all markers are drawn for each path effect in turn.
We do a little shimmy so that all paths are drawn for each path effect in turn.
We do also check for no-op saves later on for inheritance cases.
We do not bail out of the loop in cases where the failure is associated with a parsing error.
We do not exclude max_length if it matches default as we want to change the default in future.
We do not need allow_duplicates: yes for this role because eliminating duplicates is done by the execution strategy, which we do not test here.
We do not need to return anything
We do not use `tarfile` here because: - We wish to support LZMA2 compression while also supporting Python 2.7.
We do the conversion first since not all unitized data is uniform
We do the conversion first since not all unitized data is uniform process the unit information
We do the final setup for them a little differently from normal models.
We do the foo__bar splitting and handling when computing the SQL column names (as part of get_columns()).
We do this because `adb shell` does not report the exit code of the command it executes on the device, so instead we check the '__succeeded' file for our string.
We do this before the post validation due to the fact that the conditional may specify that the task be skipped due to a variable not being present which would otherwise cause validation to fail
We do this double conversion to get rid of characters that are illegal in the user's locale
We do this here to reduce the 'import numpy' initial import time.
We do this only here in the 'normal' action, as other action plugins may set this.
We do this ourselves to be timezone aware, email.Utils is not tz aware.
We do this so Z doesn't get passed as an arg to Axes.tricontour
We do this so Z doesn't get passed as an arg to Axes.tricontourf
We do this so Z doesn't get passed as an arg to PolyCollection
We do want to make sure these methods are ready if the ability to use .add or .remove with to_field relations is added some day.
We don't actually care about the content of the input file, either, so we actually stick *the new dependencies* in the input file, and copy that over the old dependencies (if present).
We don't actually want italic numerals ever.
We don't add the "_excluded_files" filter.
We don't care about SRID because CoordTransform presupposes source SRS.
We don't care about the encoding of TeXfont5, which specifies multiple encodings.
We don't enforce DNS length restrictions here (63 characters per label, 253 characters total) or make any attempt to process IDNs.
We don't fail here as there is code that better expresses the errors where the library is used.
We don't handle the monotonically decreasing case.
We don't have a handle for this artist, so we just defer to None.
We don't have access to bound_func in this scope, but we can cheat by using it on a dummy function.
We don't have any query to process, so just check what type the user expects, and return the IP address in a correct format
We don't have clang, then we don't have any llvm tools.
We don't have the bz2 capabilities to test.
We don't have the gzip capabilities to test.
We don't have to deepcopy very much here, since most things are not intended to be altered after initial creation.
We don't have to wrap the following import in a 'try', because we already know 'readline' was imported successfully.
We don't hit parameter amount limits for a, so just one query for that + fast delete of the related objs.
We don't know how to create a short name, so just mangle in all the information.
We don't know how to merge.
We don't know the length, because of appends.
We don't know this setting.
We don't know what IP version to assume, so let's check IPv4 first, then IPv6
We don't make these tests conditional because that means we would need to check and differentiate between: * MySQL+InnoDB, MySQL+MYISAM (something we currently can't do).
We don't mock out the method since we're testing code that uses `inspect` to look at that method's argspec and we want to ensure this test is easy to reason about.
We don't need any fields from the model
We don't need quote_name_unless_alias() here, since these are all going to be column names (so we can avoid the extra overhead).
We don't need them for gettext anyway, so replace them with something innocuous
We don't need this filter anymore.
We don't need to check for codenames since we already have a list of the ones we're going to create.
We don't need to check stderr, but we don't want it in test output
We don't need to update the cache, just return.
We don't need to wait for certain messages, just for the ones with ids.
We don't really need dashed contour lines to indicate negative regions, so let's turn them off.
We don't test COOKIES content, as the result might differ between Python version because parsing invalid content became stricter in latest versions.
We don't test the output formatting - that's too fragile.
We don't try to enforce the 63-char length limit.
We don't use `import django` to figure that out, so we don't pick up a Django from site-packages or similar.
We don't use the original model instances as there are some variables that refer to the Apps object.
We don't want modules to determine that running the module fires notify handlers.
We don't want such lists to be stringified.
We don't want that, so we simply remove it, and it will fall back to vanilla distutils.
We don't want the individual qs doing prefetch_related now, since we have merged this into the current work.
We don't want to call the Function constructor, call its parent.
We don't want to create dependencies between the replaced node and the replacement node as this would lead to self-referencing on the replacement node at a later iteration.
We don't want to draw a tick that even one pixel outside of the defined axis interval.
We don't want to include the class name.
We don't want to override this.
We don't want to proceed event (click on button for example), so we just skip it
We don't want to scale up the figure dpi more than once.
We don't want to trigger the prefetch_related functionality by evaluating the query.
We dont want these in the printed in the test suite.
We end up here in the case select_related() resolution proceeds from parent model to child model.
We enforce it here for the duration of the transaction.
We examine the output line-by-line until we have negotiated any privilege escalation prompt and subsequent success/error message.
We exclude ungrouped here because it was already added as a child of 'all' at the time it was created.
We expect a UnicodeWarning here, because we used broken utf-8 on purpose
We expect that this is happening because python3.4.x and below can't handle byte strings in mkstemp().
We expect top level keys to correspond to groups, iterate over them to get host, vars and subgroups (which we iterate over recursivelly)
We explicitly connect to the "other" database here.
We failed silently on open().
We fallback to the stream_url in the original info, this cannot be always used, sometimes it can give an HTTP 404 error
We filter warnings in this test which are genuine since the point of this test is to ensure that this raises.
We first look for clipid, because clipprog always appears before
We first need to detect if we're being called as part of the numpy setup procedure itself in a reliable manner.
We first sort by name, if present.
We found what frequency to use
We generate definitions for these variables on the fly when processing a rule.
We generate one INNER JOIN to D.
We get 3 queries - 1 for main query, 1 for content_objects since they all use the same table, and 1 for the 'read_by' relation.
We get the available subtitles
We get the dictionary of the track from some javascript code
We got a text frame before we completed the previous one
We got an IP address, let's mark it as such
We had to look ahead, but it wasn't need to compute the quantifier, so use this character next time around the main loop.
We have a basic dtype
We have a dictionary : update each entry individually
We have a dictionary: process it field by field
We have a fancy index that is not after an existing one.
We have a font file to embed - read it in and apply any effects
We have a query string but it's not in the known query types.

We have a simple talk
We have a string : apply it to all entries
We have a structured type
We have a sub-filter.
We have a valid CIDR, so let's write it in correct format

We have copied the file remotely and no longer require our content_tempfile
We have credentials but lets make sure that if they are JSON we have the minimum libcloud requirement met

We have leading zeros up to or past the decimal point.
We have more than one field
We have more than one record
We have not changed self.cleaned_data.
We have not figured out what about the specific distros and python versions causes this to behave differently.
We have not seen a closing angle bracket yet, but it's probably a few lines later if we look for it, so just return early here.
We have only one field: drop the name if not needed.
We have only one record: return the nb of fields
We have something else : use it for all entries
We have something else: apply it to all entries
We have to add and unref the alias so that join promotion has information of the join type for the unused alias.
We have to add extra_info to the results because it may be contained in a playlist
We have to deal with flat triangles with infinite circum_radius
We have to decide how to initialize self.mask, based on obj.mask.
We have to do some pretty insane escaping to get those backslashes and dollar signs past make, the shell, and sed at the same time.
We have to ensure that only a single thread can access a wsave array at any given time.
We have to explicitly override __getstate__ so that older versions of pickle don't try to pickle the __dict__ (which in the case of a SimpleLazyObject may contain a lambda).
We have to fetch the from_names part first and then check if from_names exists in the modules.
We have to fetch the model to test with from the main app cache, as it's not a direct dependency.
We have to fixup the deps output in a few ways.
We have to flush the fancy indexes left
We have to handle the possibility that the QuerySet we just got back contains some prefetch_related lookups.
We have to initialize found_index with -1 because some nodes may very well belong to no triangle at all, e.g., in case of Delaunay Triangulation with DuplicatePointWarning.
We have to parse the config files afterwards to have a consistent temporary filepath
We have to perform the one-time registration here.
We have to read it the memory-intensive way.
We have to remove decorators, because they are not the "original" functions, this way we can easily compare.
We have to remove the javascript callback
We have to reproduce it here
We have to retrieve the url
We have to special-case M2Ms as a list of comma-separated PKs.
We have to switch the already backwards lines twice, because we scan them from start.
We have to test this carefully.
We have to try also with an explicit prefix of /usr/local in order to catch Debian's custom user site-packages directory.
We have to use SimpleLazyObject, not self.__class__, because the latter is proxied.
We have to use this slightly awkward syntax due to the fact that we're using *args and **kwargs together.
We have to use type(self), not self.__class__, because the latter is proxied.
We haven't seen this object before, so recurse
We ignore all errors here because we are purposely triggering underflow to detect the properties of the runninng arch.
We ignore any trailing whitespace and/or comments.
We ignored case earlier, but use it as a final ranking basis.
We implement a whitelist of safe macros instead of a blacklist of unsafe macros, even though the latter appears less frequently in google code and would have been easier to implement.
We import these here because importing urllib2 is slow and a significant fraction of numpy's total import time.
We import this here because importing urllib2 is slow and a significant fraction of numpy's total import time.
We inject test functions into the global namespace, rather than using a generator, so that individual tests can be run more easily from the commandline and so each test will have its own result.
We install host executables into shared_intermediate_dir so they can be run by gyp rules that refer to PRODUCT_DIR.
We instead explicitly write all the rules we care about.
We intentionally register Promo and ChapterXtra1 but not Chapter nor ChapterXtra2.
We just added this one or this setattr worked on an internal attribute.
We just check the first line.
We just do this once per app
We just get the vertices, so if we make it out here, it can be reused.

We just want to check the setting stuff works.
We just want to pass it.
We just wrote a non-BMP character
We keep incomplete suites in Jedi to be able to complete param names or `with ...
We keep previous behavior for subclasses of memmap, i.e. the ufunc and __getitem__ output is never turned into a ndarray
We keep track of methods and subs that have been sent from the client so that we only return to the prompt or quit the app once we get back all the results from the server.
We know return is always a copy
We know that there will already be a join on the join table, so we can just add the select.
We know that we've broken the __iter__ method, so the queryset should always raise an exception.
We let disutils handle this error checking.
We limit the hash to 20 chars to keep URL short
We look for Open Graph info: We have to match any number spaces between elements, some sites try to align them (eg.: statigr.am)
We loop over every form.errors here rather than short circuiting on the first failure to make sure validation gets triggered for every form.
We made it this far, grab the first and hopefully only item in the list
We made it this far, grab the first and hopefully only server in the list
We make a single pass through each line of the inventory, building up self.groups and adding hosts, subgroups, and setting variables as we go.
We make an exception for nested parens ( (a+b) + c ).
We make sure that we get an integer back.
We may get a filename encoded with 'encodeFilename'
We may have opened the empty placeholder file.
We may have previously seen a "all-models" request for this app (no model qualifier was given).
We may not need the following imports here:
We may want to generate unique common name and verify it.
We may want to required that at least x number of forms are completed, but we'll show how to handle that later.
We may want to simply delete it.
We may want to validate that they are consistent.
We might have a path or we might have to read the data into memory.
We might have an IPv4 mapped address.
We must be able to import youtube_dl
We must be specific about the endianness here:
We must commit the transaction to ensure that MySQL gets a fresh read, since by default it runs in REPEATABLE READ mode
We must cope with more than one column having the same underlying sort field, so we base things on column numbers.
We must first write out each node within its file grouping before writing out any edges that may refer to those nodes.
We must have at least one label
We must keep track of which models we have already seen.
We must make sure the inner query has the referred columns in it.
We must promote any new joins to left outer joins so that when Q is used as an expression, rows aren't filtered due to joins.
We must use outer joins in OR case when the join isn't contained in all of the joins.
We need a bounding box enclosing all of the XObject path, but since line width may vary, we store the maximum of all occurring line widths in self.markers.
We need a new file name.
We need a newline there, for the backwards parser.
We need another database connection in transaction to test that one connection issuing a SELECT ...
We need nsapp to be top-level so our multiple-paths tests can add another location for it (if its inside a normal package with an __init__.py that isn't possible).
We need one instance for each group in order to get the right db:
We need the embed website after all
We need the field that points to the target model, so we can tell alter_field to change it - this is m2m_reverse_field_name() (as opposed to m2m_field_name, which points to our model)
We need the following only if we want to run this interactively and modify the colormap:
We need the install prefix here, but finalizing the options of the install command when only building sources cause error.
We need the mingw workaround for _ftime if the msvc runtime version is 7.1 or above and we build with mingw ...
We need the number of potentially affected rows after an "UPDATE", not the number of changed rows.
We need this because of django.db.models.query_utils.Q.
We need this so that we can skip the bad unpacking from zip()
We need this to be a queryset since parent classes introspect it to find information about the model.
We need this to be a stable sort, so always use 'mergesort' here.
We need this to behave just like the CsrfViewMiddleware, but not reject requests or log warnings.
We need to add a space.
We need to avoid hitting __reduce__, so define this slightly weird copy construct.
We need to be able to dynamically add to the list of prefetch_related lookups that we look up (see below).
We need to be able to modify the inventory
We need to be able to reset the original children of a parser.
We need to be careful so that we get the params in right places.
We need to cap at the endpoints of valid datetime
We need to change a write-only mode to a read-write mode since we've already written data to the file.
We need to change that to accommodate other language docs, but I can't work out how to make that work.
We need to check if the garbage collector can properly close numpy npz file returned by np.load when their reference count goes to zero.
We need to check raw_node always, because the same node can be returned by convert multiple times.
We need to check to see if the incoming value is actually a UnitDbl and set a flag.
We need to convert the glyph numbers to bytes, and the easiest way to do this on both Python 2 and 3 is .encode('latin-1')
We need to copy the _basedict to avoid backward propagation
We need to count indents, because if we just omit any DEDENT, we might omit them in the wrong place.
We need to define *two* skippers because Python doesn't allow both return with value and yield inside the same function.
We need to define functions that get called later.)
We need to differentiate between "provided, but using default value", and "not provided".
We need to differentiate grayscale '1.0' from tri_down marker '1'
We need to encode it back into a string to write it out.
We need to enforce the same checking as is done in arrayobject.h where the order of getting a bit-width match is long, longlong, int, short, char.

We need to fix this here.
We need to generate a derived key from our base key.
We need to get a file object for Pillow.
We need to handle Ellipsis and make arrays from indices, also check if this is fancy indexing (set no_copy).
We need to hardcode ModelBase and Field cases because its __str__ method doesn't return "applabel.modellabel" and cannot be changed.
We need to have at least one ':'.
We need to inject a modified open() builtin into the images module that checks if the file was closed properly if the function is called with a filename instead of an file object.
We need to inspect the HTML generated by the fancy 500 debug view but the test client ignores it, so we send it explicitly.
We need to load all fields for each model, except those that appear in "seen" (for all models that appear in "seen").
We need to lop the last element off a lot.
We need to modify model._meta.db_table, but everything explodes if the change isn't reversed before the end of this method.
We need to move any non-generated sources that are coming from the shared intermediate directory out of LOCAL_SRC_FILES and put them into LOCAL_GENERATED_SOURCES.

We need to set the plot limits.

We need to take the point on the left as well (else we're missing it)
We need to temporarily resolve the swappable dependency to prevent circular references.
We need to test this way because datetime.datetime inherits from datetime.date:
We need to transform the geom to the srid specified in `transform()`, so wrapping the geometry placeholder in transformation SQL.
We need to undo this in order to adhere to the Django convention of using the empty string instead of null, but only if the field accepts the empty string.
We need to unpickle the data.
We need to use DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS here, as QuerySet does not have (nor should it have) knowledge of which connection is going to be used.

We need to work with rendered models
We need two different tests to check URLconf substitution -  one to check it was changed, and another one (without self.urls) to check it was reverted on teardown.
We needed the end points only for the loc_range calculation.
We never broke out -- EOF is too soon -- Unfinished statement.
We never detected the after_sequence
We never found a match in the _mapper...
We never need to explicitly depend on previous target's link steps, because no compile ever depends on them.
We never want var_args to be a tuple.
We note the need for the warning here, but present it after the command is run, so it's more likely to be seen.
We now compute the histogram using bincount
We now convert values of a to bin indices, under the assumption of equal bin widths (which is valid here).
We now execute the Python code in a context that contains a 'models' object, representing the versioned models as an app registry.
We now loop through the remaining parameters both to ensure that all the parameters are valid fields and to determine if at least one of them needs distinct().
We now need to extend this vector out to the center of the text area.

We only download the first fragment
We only download the first fragment during the test

We only hit this case if gdb undercounted the TC's frames---which shouldn't happen unless the custom unwinder (or gdb's unwinder API) is malfunctioning.
We only look in og:video if the MIME type is a video, don't try if it's a Flash player:
We only need a single episode info, so restricting page size to one episode and dealing with page number as with episode number

We pass '0' for angle here, since it will be rotated (in raster space) in the following call to draw_text_image).
We pay attention to timeouts only while negotiating a prompt.
We pick mp3-320 for now, until format selection can be easily implemented.
We pickle the wrapped object as the unpickler's argument, so that pickle will pickle it normally, and then the unpickler simply returns its argument.
We precreate them here as an optimization
We process each entry in the playlist
We provide a number of different signatures for this method, and the logic here is all about converting them into a 4-tuple single parameter which does the actual work of expanding the envelope.
We put them here since they could be easily reused outside numpy.distutils
We really need to operate as if they'd requested '/'.
We really should have a user_stmt, but the parser couldn't process it - probably a Syntax Error (or in a comment).
We regroup everything inside the capturing group so that it can be quantified, if necessary.
We rely on the environment because it's currently the only way to reach WSGIRequestHandler.
We rely on this, so don't change the order without changing the logic.
We remove "_gyp" from the names because it helps to diff them.
We remove -1 for the last new line.
We remove every function tested by python's autoconf, hoping their own test are correct
We remove every migration that we applied from these sets so that we can bail out once the last migration has been applied and don't always run until the very end of the migration process.

We remove things from the deferred SQL that match our table name, too
We replace the current list of parent objects with the list of related objects, filtering out empty or missing values so that we can continue with nullable or reverse relations.

We return the unaveraged Pxy, freqs, and t.
We roughly follow DNS rules here, but also allow ranges (and underscores).
We run the old version through the field renames to account for those
We run this at the beginning of the next loop since we cannot be sure a file is complete until we hit the next boundary/part of the multipart content.
We scale the factor to avoid possible numerical overflow.
We set LOCAL_PATH just once, here, to the top of the project tree.
We set a block size, as this allows us to iterate over chunks when computing histograms, to minimize memory usage.
We set an explicit pk instead of relying on auto-incrementation, so we need to reset the database sequence.

We should allow any generic sequence type, including generators, Numpy ndarrays, and pandas data structures.
We should also be able to pickle things that use select_related().

We shouldn't have faked that one
We shouldn't raise a further exception.
We simplify things by making Oracle identifiers always uppercase.
We simply find the first C++ file and use that extension.
We simply need to load and display it.
We skip this handler due to the fact that it may be using a variable in the name that was conditionally included via set_fact or some other method, and we don't want to error out unnecessarily
We sort them based on their priority so that certain fields can be loaded before others, if they are dependent.
We special-case `list` rather than something more generic like `Iterable` because we don't want to accidentally match user models that define __iter__.
We start out by making sure that Bob is in no groups.
We start out by making sure that Jane has no groups.
We start out by making sure that the Group 'CIA' has no members.
We start out with a some duplicate data.
We start with a newline.
We still create expr_stmt and file_input though, because a lot of Jedi depends on its logic.
We still perform lint checks on these lines, but
We still tell link to generate a manifest, but we only use that to assert that our simpler process did not miss anything.
We store a reference to the TU in the instance so the TU won't get collected before the cursor.
We store accumulated stdout and stderr output from the process here, but strip any privilege escalation prompt/confirmation lines first.
We support two kinds of shared objects (.so): 1) shared_library, which is just bundling together many dependent libraries into a link line.
We swallow that output with a pipe.
We test once if sshpass is available, and remember the result.
We test these methods because .add/.remove aren't available for m2m fields with through, but through is the only way to set to_field currently.
We test this by checking if the file was opened.
We then serialize the current state of the database into a string and store it on the connection.
We translate between these two notions of paths with two helper functions:
We treat FormSet pretty much like we would treat a normal Form.
We try three options, in order of decreasing preference.
We try to catch it here, hoping it is early enough, and print an helpful message instead of Error: None.

We update the file only if the content has changed (ignoring line ending differences).
We update the info dict with the best quality format (backwards compatibility)
We use 1e-10 for the x point, so that we remain compatible with log axes.
We use 1e-10 for the y point, so that we remain compatible with log axes.
We use FancyBboxPatch to draw a legend frame.
We use IntegerField and not AutoField because the model is going to be deleted immediately and with an AutoField this fails on Oracle
We use PostgreSQL specific SQL here.
We use STATEMENT_TIMESTAMP to be cross-compatible with other databases.
We use a heuristic: assume all version tags have a digit.

We use frozenset to make the dictionary hashable.
We use isinstance here to guarantee that the transforms will *always* be IdentityTransforms.

We use our own sort key which is essentially a python3 compatible reimplementation of python2 sort.
We use the fact that the companion matrix is symmetric in this case in order to obtain better zeros.
We use the frame to draw the edges so we are setting the edgecolor to None
We use the name 'gyp_all_modules' as the Android build system doesn't allow the use of the Make target 'all' and because 'all_modules' is the equivalent of the Make target 'all' on Android.
We use these names to disambiguate LLDB commands from C-style expressions.

We want some elements.
We want the axes cleared every time plot() is called
We want the lightness.
We want the sorter array to be of a type that is different from np.intp in all platforms, to check for #4698
We want to draw the shadow for each pie but we will not use "shadow" option as it does'n save the references to the shadow patches.
We want to fix up these paths

We want to let any rules apply to files that are resources also.
We want to make sure that the square byte array with those dimensions is too big on 32 or 64 bit systems respectively.
We want to match something comprising:

We want to return the "general" type in most cases (ie.
We want two sets of lines, one running along the "rows" of Z and another set of lines running along the "columns" of Z.
We want unnormalized sinc.
We went through the whole loop without breaking, default to the last interval in the list and raise a warning
We weren't called from the command line or setup(), so we should run in backward-compatibility mode to support bdist_* commands.
We wil then just set it.
We will add a single large item that is slightly bigger then the cache size.
We will assign None if the field belongs to this model.

We write to a dep file on the side first and then rename at the end so we can't end up with a broken dep file.
We'll be running the executable in a temporary directory in /data/local/tmp.
We'll clip the path to the actual rendering extents if the path isn't filled.
We'll detect these cases using the exit code, which should cause 'shell.call' to raise.
We'll just take the largest, to avoid some downcasting
We'll only move things we want into 'good'.
We'll return None on FIPS enabled systems
We'll save ourselves a copy of a potentially large array in the common case where neither to_begin or to_end was given.
We'll say it should occur by line 10.
We'll see how to handle that case later.
We'll then go through that list later and order it and split into migrations to resolve dependencies caused by M2Ms and FKs.
We'll update counters on each iteration just below.
We're being overly cautious about which keys to accept (more so than the Windows environment is capable of doing), since the powershell env provider's limitations don't appear to be documented.
We're checking the rights to an auto-created intermediate model, which doesn't have its own individual permissions.
We're dealing with a literal, so it's already been "resolved"
We're dealing with a structured array, each field of the dtype matches a column

We're forcing a transaction on a non-transactional-DDL backend
We're going into math now, so set font to 'it'
We're going to have to initialize the wrapped object to successfully pickle it, so we might as well just pickle the wrapped object since they're supposed to act the same way.

We're not testing the plugin run() method, just the helper methods ActionBase defines
We're not using .download here sine that is just a shim for outside error handling, and returns the exit code instead of the result dict.
We're only interested in the fields of the result expressions.
We're only interested in the latest replaced node, so filter out replaced nodes that are parents of other replaced nodes.
We're out of ports, LiveServerTestCase correctly fails with a socket error.
We're requesting escalation with a password, so we have to wait for a password prompt.
We're requesting escalation without a password, so we have to detect success/failure before sending any initial data.
We're still here so we can now return the new value
We're testing app registry presence on load, so this is handy.
We're using a custom command so we need the alternate settings
We're using a system freetype
We're using regular expressions rather than time.strptime because: - They provide both validation and parsing.
We're using the posixpath module to mix paths and URLs conveniently.
We're writing a python string that's used by a variety of shells on the remote host to invoke a python "one-liner".
We've acquired a port, ensure our server threads acquired different addresses.
We've already built freetype
We've already cached all the paths at this point
We've already got a longhand ip_str.
We've determined that the last portion was an identifier and thus, not part of the module name
We've pushed everything we need to the device.
We've requested escalation (with or without a password), now we wait for an error message or a successful escalation.

When there are multiple paths to a table from another table, we have to be careful not to accidentally reuse an inappropriate join when using select_related().
When there are several instances of the origin
When there is a local manager we shouldn't get any warning and 'objects' shouldn't be created.
When there is a loop-in-loop, the state is bound to the inner loop, so it resets when the outer loop continues.
When there is an inherited manager we shouldn't get any warning and 'objects' shouldn't be created.
When there is no URI in EXT-X-MEDIA let this tag's data be used by regular URI lines below
When there is no target, we need to take a point, one unit away from the origin, and move it into the right location so that the origin acts like the target
When there's no instance of the origin of the one-to-one
When there's one instance of the origin (p.undergroundbar used to return that instance)
When this entire method is refactored into expressions, then we can check each part as we generate it.
When time zone support is enabled, convert "now" to the user's time zone so Django's definition of "Today" matches what the user expects.
When trying to resume, Content-Range HTTP header of response has to be checked to match the value of requested Range HTTP header.
When tuples contain items that deconstruct to identical values, those tuples should be considered equal for the purpose of detecting state changes (even if the original items are unequal).
When updating, previously used but no longer needed backends are flushed.
When used from setup.py, we don't want to import _version.py, so we do it with a regexp instead.
When using CheckboxSelectMultiple, the framework expects a list of input and returns a list of input.
When using Type 3 fonts, we can't use character codes higher than 255, so we use the "Do" command to render those instead.
When we can, attempt to validate the timezone.
When we enable nohup logging, the test or any Python script that calls this script via subprocess.Popen will hang on Popen.communicate().
When we end our blocking transaction, our thread should be able to continue.
When we prefetch the teachers, and force the query, we don't want the default manager on teachers to immediately get all the related qualifications, since this will do one query per teacher.
When we see a declaration that we've been waiting for, we can delete the note.
When you call __str__ on the query object, it doesn't know about using so it falls back to the default.
When you set dvipng -bg Transparent, it actually makes the alpha channel 1 and does the background compositing and antialiasing itself and puts the blended data in the rgb channels.
Whenever a test starts executing, only the "default" database is connected.
Whenever binary compatibility is broken, both C_API_VERSION and C_ABI_VERSION should be increased.

While 'limit_choices_to' might be a callable, simply pass it along for later - this is too early because it's still model load time.
While I think I have it quite locked down, it is execution of arbitrary code without sanitation.
While in format selection we may need to have an access to the original format set in order to calculate some metrics or do some processing.

While the session is empty, it hasn't been flushed so a cookie should still be set, along with Vary: Cookie.
While this is always weird (getitem is not used, it does not have setitem nor knows about fancy indexing), this tests gh-3110
While this means you can set the level/range with selinux.lsetfilecon(), it may or may not mean that you will get the selevel as part of the context returned by selinux.lgetfilecon().
While ugly, it's a lot more robust than what was previously being used.
While we're at it, test whether a QuerySet is returned if there *is* a value.
Why do we need to null out user.avatar if we are going to delete the user immediately after it, and there are no more cascades.

Xcode 7 started shipping with ".tbd" (text based stubs) files instead of ".dylib" without providing a real support for them.
Xcode IDs are only 96 bits (24 hex characters), but a SHA-1 digest is is 160 bits.
Xcode adds the product directory by default.
Xcode always outputs "isa" as the first element of an object dictionary.
Xcode does not have a distinct type for loadable modules that are pure BSD targets (not in a bundle wrapper).
Xcode handles most prefixes based on the target type, however there are exceptions.
Xcode has some "issues" with checking dependencies for the "Compile sources" step with any source files/headers generated by actions/rules.
Xcode is weird about remoteGlobalIDString.
Xcode properly detects a file being renamed over an open project file as a change and so it remains able to present the "project file changed" sheet under this system.
Xcode puts shared_library results into PRODUCT_DIR, and some gyp files rely on this.
Xcode seems to choose based on content.
Xcode seems to sort this list case-insensitively
Xcode sets remoteInfo to the name of the target and not the name of its product, despite this proxy being a reference to the product.

Xcode supports various suffices on environment variables, which are all undocumented.
Xcode uses variants for localization.
Xcode usually prints remoteGlobalIDString values in PBXContainerItemProxy objects without comments.
Xcode watches for changes to the project file and presents a UI sheet offering to reload the project when it does change.
Xcode will still handle this as an "absolute path" that starts with the variable.
Xcode's built-in rule support is almost powerful enough to use directly, but there are a few significant deficiencies that render them unusable.

You can subclass a Form to add fields.
You can use 'in' to test for membership...
You can use 'pk' with reverse foreign key lookups.
You can use values() with iterator() for memory savings, because iterator() uses database-level iteration.
You can't associate it with a Publication until it's been saved.
You can't just add NOT NULL fields with no default or fields which don't allow empty strings as default.
You can't proxy a swapped model
You can't test beyond this because each developer's machines may have a different set of SDKs installed.
You can't trivially replace this with `functools.partial` because this binds to classes and returns bound instances, whereas functools.partial (on CPython) is a type and its instances don't bind.
You don't want your viewers squinting to read your plot.

``__init__`` is special because the params need are injected this way.
``initial`` should be a list of dicts.
``input_dims`` and ``output_dims`` specify number of input dimensions and output dimensions to the transformation.
``language`` is either a language code string or a sequence with the language code as its first item
``list(...)`` is needed, because this runs in parallel with application code which might be mutating ``sys.modules``, and this will fail with RuntimeError: cannot mutate dictionary while iterating
``os.path`` is a hardcoded exception, because it's a ``sys.modules`` modification.
``self`` is a new object resulting from ndarray.__new__(InfoArray, ...), therefore it only has attributes that the ndarray.__new__ constructor gave it - i.e. those of a standard ndarray.

`d` is already a Leaf (Name).
`dot` should just return zero (m, n) matrix
`errcheck` keyword may be set to False for routines that return void, rather than a status code.

`filename` may include a path as returned by FileField.upload_to.
`fmt` can be a string with multiple insertion points or a list of formats.
`git status --porcelain --branch` can collect all information branch, remote_branch, untracked, staged, changed, conflicts, ahead, behind
`method` is the new parent of the array, don't know if that's good.
`name` and `age` should not be grouped on.
`name` shouldn't appear in base_fields because it's part of readonly_fields.
`obj` is not a view, make sure recursive bordering is not requested
`obj` is not a view, make sure recursive unbordering is not requested
`objectGroups` are used by the client to designate remote objects on the server that should stick around (for potential future queries), and eventually released with a `releaseObjectGroup` call.
`offset` is a datetime.timedelta.
`params` are test specific overrides and `_caches_settings_base` is the base config for the tests.
`plot` returns a list, but we want the handle - thus the comma on the left
`prefetch_through` is the path we traverse to perform the prefetch.
`prefetch_to` is the path to the attribute that stores the result.
`range()` for exmple allows an optional start value at the beginning.
`settings_dict` should be a dictionary containing keys such as NAME, USER, etc.
`shutil.which()` can be used when Python 2.7 support is dropped.

here is the new standard location for fonts
here is where we build the table of contents...
here we don't need to make an additional call, will default to 'us-east-1' if the below evaluates to None.
here we encode the args, so we have a uniform charset to work with, and split on white space
here we place any excess chunk back onto the stream, as well as throwing away the CRLFCRLF bytes from above.
here we rely on .split() being called inside the _fetch() in trans_real.translation()
here's a fun little line of code for you:
hex color with alpha.
hex color with no alpha.
hex has invalid boolean value

hh should should work with 0 retries.
hhvm_wrapper emits an extra line to let us know its compiling bytecode.

hist can add zero height Rectangles, which is useful to keep the bins, counts and patches lined up, but it throws off log scaling.
histogram our data with numpy

o API support for invalid translation units.
o At this point everything is ready, and the harness simply reports the results.
o When all files are compiled, the harness begins to run the tests.
o When all files are processed, the harness begins to compile them, keeping track of all compile fails for later results reporting.
o cleanup ctypes wrapping, would be nice to separate the ctypes details more clearly, and hide from the external interface (i.e., help(cindex)).
o expose code completion APIs.
o fix memory management issues (currently client must hold on to index and translation unit, or risk crashes).
o implement additional SourceLocation, SourceRange, and File methods.

scale is already included in the transform
scale lhs to improve condition number and solve
scale the dash pattern by the linewidth
scale the dash patters
scale the z value to match
scale to screen coordinates
scale up the axis label box to also find the neighbors, not just the tick labels that actually overlap note we need a *copy* of the axis label box because we don't wan't to scale the actual bbox
scale w to get the right value

since the user is no longer typing, reactivate the standard command keys
since this can be a non-bool now, we need to handle it correctly
since this is a mix-in, it may not have an underlying datastructure associated with it, so we pull it out now in case we need it for error reporting below
since we are using a single freq, all time slices should be about the same
since we can't send callbacks here, we display a message directly in the same fashion used by the on_include callback.
since we can't use context managers and "with" without overriding run(), call them directly
since we can't use context managers and "with" without overriding run(), call them directly to clean up
since we only test for the params change.
since we skip incrementing the stats when the task result is first processed, we do so now for each host in the list
since we will be killing anyway, use large value for ops_per_thread
since we're delegating, we don't want to use interpreter values which would have been set for the original target host

str imbues less precision
str is just to test some Python 2 issue with bytestrings
str is treated as UTF-8-encoded.
str needed because of possible unicode stuff in py2k (pydoc doesn't work with unicode strings)

this trick enables us to perform counts on object-like elements across multiple axes very quickly because integer addition is very well optimized
this typically means we couldn't even parse the docstring, not just that the YAML is busted, probably a quoting issue.

we added exactly one item, len() should reflect that
we also test the case where matchpathcon returned a failure
we always start the search for roles in the base directory of the playbook
we are actually running plays
we are doing a listing
we are going to ignore unknown lines here - this may be a bad idea - but you can override it in your subclass
we are just doing a listing
we assume each item in the list is itself a list, as we support "conditional includes" for vars_files, which mimics the with_first_found mechanism.
we avoid writing the token `exec` so as not to crash python 2's parser
we can get normals by retrieving each control point
we can only use tty when we are not pipelining the modules.
we can't access the label attr until *after* the line is inited
we can't mix TextField (NCLOB) and CharField (NVARCHAR), so convert all fields to NCLOB when we expect NCLOB
we can't take more dimensions then we have, not even for 0-d arrays.
we continue on loader failures
we create a copy of the attributes here due to the fact that it was intialized as a class param in the meta class, so we need a unique object here (all members contained within are unique already).
we create a new data structure here, using the same object used internally by the YAML parsing code so we can preserve file:line:column information if it exists

we don't define the usual template_name here
we don't export these for import *, but we do want them accessible as numerictypes.bool, etc.
we don't have access to the cwd, probably because of sudo.
we don't need to store the salt, but Django used to do this
we don't use iteritems() here to avoid problems if the underlying dict changes sizes due to the templating, which can happen with hostvars
we don't want the figure's patch to influence the bbox calculation
we don't want the full set of attributes (the task lists), as that would lead to a serialize/deserialize loop
we don't want to add this to the return list because the texts and handles are assumed to be in one-to-one correspondence.
we don't want to assume all -d flags are backends, e.g., -debug

we don't want to re-assign these values, which were determined by the ModuleArgsParser() above
we draw the text up to where the cursor should go, measure and save its dimensions, draw the real text, then put the cursor at the saved dimensions
we expect negative retncode if kill option was given
we expect zero retncode if no kill option

we force saving language to a cookie rather than a session by excluding session middleware and those which do require it
we get back a dictionary with two keys in it, the first called llvm, the other called swift.
we got no manual parameter names but more than an 'ax' ...
we handle any 'vars' specified in the ds here, as we may be adding things to them below (special handling for includes).
we have a field which also returns a name
we have only 1 name and 1 array
we have our match, so clear the start_at_task field on the play context to flag that we've started at a task (and future plays won't try to advance)
we have registered two models from two different apps
we have to do the following lines to make ax.autoscale_view work
we have to relaunch the process pip marker to avoid a relaunch bug
we have to use indexes, and then parse out the other parts not supported by indexing
we haven't: just add the description to the current list
we import here to prevent a circular dependency with imports
we import this here to prevent an import loop problem, since the objects code also imports ansible.errors
we know we can skip this, as it's not going to be found on galaxy.ansible.com
we may derive from matplotlib.patches.BoxStyle._Base class.
we may need check the calling convention of the given function
we merge in vars from groups specified in the inventory (INI or script)
we need a (numrects x numsides x 2) numpy array for the path helper function to build a compound path
we need a positive definite
we need the noarch path in case the package is pure python.
we need to check the range of values for example, -90 to 90, 0 to 360,
we need to clean up after ourselves -- only do this on test success
we need to do this so decimal places get normalized
we need to move it over
we need to register a custom ModelAdmin (instead of just using ModelAdmin) because the field creator tries to find the ModelAdmin for the related model
we need to revert to MaskedArray, but keeping the possibility of subclasses (eg, TimeSeriesRecords), so we'll force a type set to the first parent
we need to support 3.2 which doesn't match the standard get_versions methods regex
we need to test only one call of migrate
we no longer need x and y to be 2 dimensional, so flatten them.
we only allow one callback of type 'stdout' to be loaded, so check the name of the current plugin and type to see if we need to skip loading this callback plugin
we only cache in the case where we have a single variable name, to make sure we're not putting things which may otherwise be dynamic in the cache (filters, lookups, etc.)
we only extract files, and remove any relative path bits that might be in the file for security purposes and drop the leading directory, as mentioned above
we only get here if someone scored
we only know how to do this operation if other is a Transform.
we only need to update if there is nothing set yet.
we only return the first artist
we override "build_py" in both distutils and setuptools
we override different "sdist" commands for both environments
we presumably already logged a message on the failure of the main plot, don't keep reporting
we put some pad here to compensate the size of the marker
we ran out of attempts, so mark the result as failed
we replicate Color to register with another ModelAdmin
we require that all commands are run from the project root, i.e. the directory that contains setup.py, setup.cfg, and versioneer.py .
we return patches, so put it back in the expected order
we return the values in the order they were originally specified in the given hosts array
we run the --json version first because --json --refactor doesn't change any files, but plain --refactor does (i.e. the latter isn't idempotent)
we set a flag to indicate this include was static
we should be redirected to the login page.
we shouldn't get a 500 error caused by a NoReverseMatch
we shouldn't include a file more than once.
we skip basic code as they are added explicitly
we skip the first word, as od -b output an index at the beginning of each line
we split on spaces and newlines separately, so that we can tell which character we split on for reassembly inside quotation characters
we store the character glyphs w/o flipping.
we store the role path internally
we strip off the top-level directory for all of the files contained within the tar file here, since the default is 'github_repo-target', and change it to the specified role's name
we unfortunately need to template the delegate_to field here, as we're fetching vars before post_validate has been called on the task that has been passed in
we unwrap the phase here to handle the onesided vs.
we unwrap the phase later to handle the onesided vs.
we use a MagicMock to register the result of the call we expect to `v2_playbook_on_call`.
we use two different sizes for the b array here to test the two different paths in in1d().
we want to cache the fonts at the class level so that when multiple figures are created we can reuse them.
we want to get rid of files encrypted with the AES cipher
we want to upstream this to atom, so do not require nuclide- prefix
we will set up a dict mapping legend line to orig line, and enable picking on the legend line
we won't error here, as it may *not* be a problem, and we don't want to break modules unnecessarily
we'll also need a temp file to hold our module arguments
we'll draw ourself after the artist we annotate by default
we'll update the position when the line data is set
we'll update these later
we're assuming no funny business that needs to be quoted for the shell
we're changing the playbook basedir, so if we had set one previously clear the host/group vars entries from the VariableManager so they're not incorrectly used by playbooks from different directories
we're done with the child state, so clear it and continue back to the top of the loop to get the next task
we're done, so restore the old basedir in the loader
we're not changing the length of the sequence
we're only interested if we can find a function parameter of that type
we're probably running setup.py as execfile("setup.py") (likely we're building an egg)
we're running as root on the local system so do some trivial checks for ensuring 'host' is actually a chroot'able dir
we're using a real play context here
we've already processed the hold
we've moved the module_common relative to the snippets, so fix the path

when aspec is "auto", consider it as 1.
when calling np.put, make sure a TypeError is raised if the object isn't an ndarray
when inherited model, its PK is also fetched, hence '4' deferred fields.
when layering multiple images, the images need to have the same extent.
when loc is a tuple of axes(or figure) coordinates.
when multiple file are assigned as content, make sure they are all closed with the response.
when piping to "head -n1"
when plotlines are None (only errorbars are drawn), we just make legline invisible.
when testing deprecation warnings, it's useful to run just one test since the message won't be displayed multiple times
when tight bbox is used
when used directly, this class needs a loader, but we want to make sure we don't trample on the existing one if this class is used as a mix-in with a playbook base class
when using private_networking, the API reports the private one in "ip_address".

wx always returns an uppercase, so make it lowercase if the shift key is not depressed (NOTE: this will not handle Caps Lock)
wxPython allows for portable font styles, choosing them appropriately for the target platform.
wxWindows does not provide any stock images, so I've 'stolen' those from GTK2, and transformed them into the appropriate format.
x and y are PBXReferenceProxy objects.
x and y are bounds, so z should be the value *inside* those bounds.
x coord of mouse in data coords
x in axes coords, y in data coords
x in axes coords, y in display coords (to be updated at draw time by _update_label_positions)

x, y, rotation is given in pixel coordinate.
x, y: normal horizontal arrow
x,y,z equal sized 1D arrays
x0, y0: arrow without shaft, for short vectors
xcode passes mdynamic-no-pic by default for executable and possibly static lib according to mento
xcodebuild requires Xcode and can't run on Command Line Tools-only systems from 10.7 onward.
xlim and ylim of ax_pms will be automatically adjusted.

yaml.safe_load will return non-string objects for some of the fields we are interested in, this ensures that everything comes back as a string
yes, we're double-encoding over the wire in this case- we want to ensure that the data shipped to the end PS pipeline is still b64-encoded

you can add a pdf note to attach metadata to a page
you can also access the window or vbox attributes this way
you can set the attribute - but it will not save
you can specify the xypoint and the xytext in different positions and coordinate systems, and optionally turn on a connecting line and mark the point with a marker.
you can summarize over a single variable, like years or months
you may want to play with the borderpad value and the bbox_to_anchor coordinate.
