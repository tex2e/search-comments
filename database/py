"*" matches anything, ".example.com" matches example.com and all subdomains
"/' Used when a value is quoted.
"Alter" the field's blankness.
"Convert" the plist so that any weird whitespace changes from the preprocessor do not affect the XML parser in mac_tool.
"FirstPublished" contains the date for original airing.
"Model.field" Check clashes between accessor or reverse query name of `field` and any other field name -- i.e. accessor for Model.foreign is model_set and it clashes with Target.model_set.
"Narrow" Python builds don't support unicode code points outside BMP.
"Qualified" means the file that a target was defined in and the target name, separated by a colon, suffixed by a # and the toolset name: /path/to/file.gyp:target_name#toolset
"all" is a concatenation of the "all" targets from all the included sub-makefiles.
"auto_id" tells the Form to add an "id" attribute to each form element.
"feature" and "nightly-news" pages use theplatform.com
"git add" the result.
"gyp_all_modules" is a concatenation of the "gyp_all_modules" targets from all the included sub-makefiles.
"implementation" for Solaris 9.
"include" is specified relative to subdict_path, so compute the real path to include by appending the provided "include" to the directory in which subdict_path resides.
"include" should use the new style "foo/bar.h" instead of just "bar.h"
"isa" isn't in the _properties dictionary, it's an intrinsic property of the class which the object belongs to.
"iv" from gen_key_initctr
"key" is a reserved word in MySQL, so use "cache_key" instead.
"ls" sometimes prints on stderr
"noqa" is used to suppress this warning.
"raw" and "include" directives are disabled
"unwrap" the widget wrapper, if needed

' + ' '.join(comment_notes)

'#' characters must be escaped even embedded in a string, else Make will treat it as the start of a comment.
')' will be handled by the parentheses group
',' is also official (less common): NOM-008-SCFI-2002
'--list' this is last to make it default
'/' is notably absent from this list, because there's no way for a regular expression to be treated as a path.
'::' should be encompassed by start, digits or end.
'Dydd Llun' The *_INPUT_FORMATS strings use the Python strftime format syntax, see http://docs.python.org/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior
'ENDDATE': 'For legal reasons, this video was only available for a specified period of time.',
'Geometry' initialization implies an unknown geometry type.
'Julia' with accented 'u':
'PREMIUM': 'PREMIUM',
'True' or 'true' should be rendered without a value attribute
'_meta.related_field' also contains M2M reverse fields, these will be filtered out
'all' is special cased to mean all the root targets.
'cmake -E copy src dst' will create the 'dst' directory if needed.
'col' is of the form 'field' or 'field1__field2' or '-field1__field2__field', etc.
'contentv4' is used in the website, but it also returns the related videos, we don't need them
'created', non-editable, is excluded by default
'data_abstract' is a forward field, and therefore will be found
'data_abstract' is a reverse field, and will raise an exception
'django.contrib.admin'.
'django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.DefaultStorageFinder',
'find' returns the top of these four bytes, so we'll need to munch them later to prevent them from polluting the payload.
'id' in list_display_links
'id' not in list_display_links
'isolation_level' is a misleading API.
'mac_framework_dirs', input already handles _dirs endings.
'managed' is True by default.
'obj' can be a class or a function.
'parse_interface_line' and 'parse_inet*_line' leave two dicts in the ipv4/ipv6 lists which is ugly and hard to read.
'parse_interface_line()' checks for previously seen interfaces before defining 'current_if' so that IPv6 facts don't clobber IPv4 facts (or vice versa).
'paywall': 'paywall',
'pk' is included for backwards compatibility
'pointsize': '10pt', Additional stuff for the LaTeX preamble.
'recommended' feed has infinite 'load more' and each new portion spins the same videos in (sometimes) slightly different order, so we'll check for unicity and break when portion has no new videos
'shutdown_message' is a stealth option.
'skip': 'Extremely unreliable',
'table_name_filter' is a stealth option
'target_build_files' keeps track of the keys corresponding to "target" files.
'truncatingBitPattern' initializer is defined if the conversion is truncating on any platform that Swift supports.
'url' results don't have a title
'video exists but is marked as "deleted" md5 is unstable
(1) the file output should mention the proper .o file.
(A UTF-8-based locale which is thoroughly different from "C" would flush out more bugs, but we have no way of knowing if such a locale exists.)
(Also in the printed Python Cookbook.)
(First we need to know which order the keys fall in "naturally" on your system, so we can put things in the wrong way around from normal.
(For instance, setting the UNIX socket file to be readable and writable by a specific UNIX group and then putting users into that group).
(For the systems where this happens, temporary files will be auto-deleted on close anyway.)
(GenericRelation was previously a fake m2m field).
(If we're expecting a prompt but the escalation succeeds, we didn't need the password and can carry on regardless.)
(Maybe add handler.free_file to complement new_file)
(Monday) The *_INPUT_FORMATS strings use the Python strftime format syntax, see http://docs.python.org/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior Kept ISO formats as they are in first position
(Note that Model._get_next_or_previous_by_FIELD coerces values to strings)
(Note, too, that we clear the ordering here so as not to drag the 'headline' field into the columns being used to determine uniqueness)
(On Unix, clever use of select() might be able to get that down to one, but zero is Hard.
(Possibly external) members of CLASS_KINDS.
(Setuptools does this for some reason.)
(That's why this adapter is deprecated.)
(The pk info is propagated to child models so that does not need to be checked in parents.)
(This check prevents duck typing, but it could be removed if it became a problem in practice.)
(Unittest's default is to set top-level equal to the path, which means relative imports will result in "Attempted relative import in non-package.").
(We use something that will fit into a latin1 database encoding here, because that is still the default used on many system setups.)
(We're assuming the temp dir name itself only contains ASCII characters.)

Because Xcode's rule engine is not being used, they need to be expanded as they are written to the makefile.
Because a cache can fail silently (e.g. memcache), we don't know if we are failing to create a new session because of a key collision or because the cache is missing.
Because a particular *instance* of the class might want to alter self.fields, we create self.fields here by copying base_fields.
Because close can be called during shutdown we need to cache os.unlink and access it as self.unlink only
Because disabling constraint checks can be expensive on some database (especially MSSQL), bail out early if no fixtures are found.
Because floating-point arithmetic isn't exact, we set a tolerance to pass into GEOS `equals_exact`.
Because it happens to have the same fields as the Category model, we can just call the form's save() to apply its changes to an existing Category instance.
Because no Articles exist yet, earliest() raises ArticleDoesNotExist.
Because no Articles exist yet, latest() raises ArticleDoesNotExist.
Because of that wo can't make use of the get_list method in the AWSQueryConnection.
Because of the DST change, 2 days and 6 hours after the chosen date in naive arithmetic is only 2 days and 5 hours after in aware arithmetic.
Because only whitespaces are allowed before the keywords, this will also ignore most do-while-loops, since those lines should start with closing brace.
Because place is the primary key on Restaurant, the save will create a new restaurant
Because pointers have been set to NULL, an exception should be raised when we try to access it.
Because settings are imported lazily, we need to explicitly load them.
Because the ForeignKey cannot be null, existing members of the set must remain.
Because the result of force_escape is "safe", an additional escape filter has no effect (to be changed in Django 2.0).
Because these methods are defined inside of the class, they get bound to the instance when the object is created.
Because this is a middleware, we can't assume the errors will be caught elsewhere.
Because this is an async task, the action handler is async.
Because this parser has no nesting state about templates, by the time it saw "class Comparator", it may think that it's a new class.
Because we have messed with __class__ below, we confuse pickle as to what class we are pickling.
Because we haven't made any remote connection we're running as the local user, rather than as whatever is configured in remote_user.
Because we use select_related() for 'boss', it doesn't need to be prefetched, but we can still traverse it although it contains some nulls
Because we want to test creation and deletion of these as separate things, these models are all inserted into a separate Apps so the main test runner doesn't migrate them.
Because we've now applied 0001 and 0002 both, their squashed replacement should be marked as applied.
Before Django 1.6 this caused a NoneType error in the caching mechanism.
Before anything else, see if there's conflicting apps and drop out hard if there are any
Before anything else, see if there's conflicting apps and drop out hard if there are any and they don't want to merge
Before deleting, there has to be an existing cookie
Before enabling that we need to make sure we don't want to add additional directories (add_directory()) once we start using the iterator.
Before nixing comments, check if the line is blank for no good reason.
Before running the migration we have a table for Shetland Pony, not Little Horse
Before the first output, send the stored headers
Before the fix, this list was too short (some values were omitted).
Before we get too far, make sure pysqlite 2.5+ is installed.

Benchmarks that are run as part of other benchmarks are excluded.
Besides these, we don't accept anything else, otherwise we might get false negatives when existing comment is a substring of the expected namespace.
Besides, NT 4 is obsolete.)
Better yet, callers can just call AddFile with a pathname and not worry about building their own PBXBuildFile objects.
BetterWriter model is a subclass of Writer with an additional `score` field

Borrowed from Peter Hunt and the CherryPy project (http://www.cherrypy.org).
Both 'countries' only have two geometries.
Both InterfaceError and ProgrammingError seem to be used when accessing closed cursor (psycopg2 has InterfaceError, rest seem to use ProgrammingError).
Both Login objs should have same description so that only the one having smaller PK will be deleted.
Both can be increased if necessary.
Both messages are twice on page -- one rendered as html, one as plain text (for pastebin)
Both of those raise warnings, so the testcase class ignores them all.
Both rel_a and rel_b are promoted to LOUTER joins.
Both rings in this geometry are not closed.
Both spellings are acceptable:
Both the name of the header and its value are ASCII strings.
Both the original parent and child have paths set.
Both the pet and the person have been deleted from the right database
Boto also doesn't provide wrapper classes to CacheClusters or CacheNodes.
Boto also doesn't provide wrapper classes to ReplicationGroups Because of that wo can't make use of the get_list method in the AWSQueryConnection.

Broken UTF-8 sequences remain escaped.
Browsers don't send extra whitespace or semicolons in Cookie headers, but parse_cookie() should parse whitespace the same way document.cookie parses whitespace.

Bump texture map_bump texture_bump.jpg or bump texture_bump.jpg
Bump up the version for upgrade.
Bundle all of the above together, if needed.
Bundle postbuilds can depend on the whole bundle, so run them after the bundle is packaged, not already after the bundle binary is done.
But "full_name_2" has, and it can be used to initialize the class.
But XCTarget is defined below, so it can't be put into the schema yet.
But a leading 0 before the .
But a repeated hit will hit cache
But age isn't included in values(), so it is.
But don't append empty tool node.
But don't append the truncation text if the current text already ends in this.
But if the new text contains any line breaks, we can create one
But if the user is getting a permission denied error it probably means that docker on their system is only configured to be connected to by root and they are not running as root.
But if we fill in data for one of the fields, the form is no longer empty and the whole thing must pass validation.
But if we kill the cache, we get a new object
But if we kill the cache, we get a new object.
But if we render the response, we can pickle it.
But if we wait a couple of seconds...
But in UTC, the __date only matches one of them.
But in many cases, after trie compression there will be fewer than 256 unique second-level lookup tables and/or data storage blocks, which allows one to use 8-bit words in lookup tables.
But it can't be taken into account for checking if limit doesn't match any hosts.
But it should appear in get_fields()/fieldsets() so it can be displayed as read-only.
But it should still be possible to add new ordering after that.
But it shouldn't be deleted, even if there are no more objects using it.
But it's still good enough for CheckSectionSpacing.
But should work fine when transformed to projected coordinates
But since older bigip libraries don't give us a way to toggle verification we need to disable it at the global level.
But some of the values are currently being used by other subclasses (for instance, os_family and distribution).
But that requires changing other things too (known thing to change would be PATHS_CACHE, PLUGIN_PATHS_CACHE, and MODULE_CACHE.
But the first entry in the query's FROM clause must not be a JOIN.
But the limitation of the get_internal_type() / data_types approach is that it cannot handle database column types that aren't already mapped to one of the built-in Django field types.
But the naive approach would put the TOC file into the bundle, so don't do this for bundles for now.
But the same query issued explicitly at a database will work.
But we aren't smart enough to remove the existing annotations from the query, so those would force us to use GROUP BY.
But we can access keys on the dict that's returned by ``__call__``, instead.
But we fake them when query logging is enabled to keep query counts consistent with other backends.
But we still only instantiate 3 forms
But you can get natural keys if you ask for them and they are available
But, as the join is nullable first use by annotate will be LOUTER
But, this relation isn't direct, the join is generated reverse along foreign key.
By convention, it's called "all".
By default OFTReals are mapped to `FloatField`, however, they may also be mapped to `DecimalField` if specified in the `decimal` keyword.
By default foreign object doesn't relate to any remote field (for example custom multicolumn joins currently have no remote field).
By default memcached allows objects up to 1MB.
By default related field will not have a column as it relates to columns from another table.
By default the fields come from ModelAdmin.list_editable, but if we pull the fields out of the form instead of list_editable custom admins can provide fields on a per request basis
By default, 'database'-tagged checks are not run as they do more than mere static code analysis.
By default, Django will use a "pretty" version of the form field name, if the Field is part of a Form.
By default, all are NULL in the table.
By default, all geometry types are allowed.
By default, an extra blank form is included.
By default, forms append a hyphen between the prefix and the field name, but a form can alter that behavior by implementing the add_prefix() method.
By default, it displays 1 blank form.
By default, it only gets you your Nuclide server processes.
By default, the get query will be directed to 'other'
By default, the ordering is different from the swapped version
By default, you get raw keys on dumpdata
By design, these four functions don't perform any checks on their arguments.
By doing this we detach the socket from the CherryPy stack avoiding memory leaks
By inheriting from LazyObjectTestCase and redefining the lazy_wrap() method which all testcases use, we get to make sure all behaviors tested in the parent testcase also apply to SimpleLazyObject.
By picking up this special type and converting it to a dynamic library (com.apple.product-type.library.dynamic) with fix-ups, single-file loadable modules can be produced.
By the way this causes Crunchyroll to not work in georestriction cases in some browsers that don't place the locale lang first in header.
By using the cache, it is possible to avoid running get_format_modules repeatedly.
By using this, we are testing that the view processor is properly lazy and doesn't call get_token() until needed.
Bypass Django's wrappers and use the underlying sqlite3 connection to avoid logging this query - it would trigger infinite recursion.
Bytestrings are transformed to normal strings.
C can't deal with Unicode escapes in identifiers.
C doesn't grok regexes, and they aren't needed for gettext, so just output a string instead.
C doesn't have single-quoted strings, so make all strings double-quoted.
C++ apps need to be linked with g++.

Exclude excluded sources coming into the generator.
Exclude excluded sources from being built.
Exclude fields that aren't on the form.

Fetching the typed text for each result is expensive, so this requires only O(log N) lookups / comparisons.
Field and dimensions should be cleared after a delete.
Field is removed and part of an index/unique_together
Field should point to another model
FieldFile needs access to its associated model field and an instance it's attached to in order to work properly, but the only necessary data to be pickled is the file's name itself.
Fields #####################################################################
Fields are sometimes used without attaching them to models (for example in aggregation).
Fields can individually be required or optional.
Fields from columns whose names are Python keywords.
Fields on related models are stored in the literal double-underscore format, so that we can use a set datastructure.
Fields that are foreignkeys/m2ms depend on stuff
Fields that contain one-to-many relations with a generic model (like a GenericForeignKey) cannot generate reverse relations and therefore cannot be used for reverse querying.
Fields whose names normalize to the same Python field name and hence are given an integer suffix.
Fields with choices get special treatment.
Fields with database column types of `varchar` and `text` need a second index that specifies their operator class, which is needed when performing correct LIKE queries outside the C locale.
Figure ous ssh IP and Port
Figure out all the projects that will be generated and their guids
Figure out the pathname that this project needs to use to refer to the other one.
Figure out the underlying type of the enum to know if it is a signed or unsigned quantity.
Figure out what the contents of the variable parens are.
File class to use for file instances.
File coding may be specified.
File downloaded with and without credentials are different, so omit the md5 field
File extension may by .py, .pyc, etc.
File locking is not supported.
File names longer than 255 characters can cause problems on older OSes.
File objects can be assigned to FileField attributes, but shouldn't get committed until the model it's attached to is saved.
File representing the completion of actions/rules/copies, if any.
File representing whether any input dependencies necessary for dependent actions have completed.
File representing whether any input dependencies necessary for dependent compiles have completed.
File size part may be missing
File-like and iterator interface.
FileFields are a special case because they take their data from the request.FILES, not request.POST.
FileInput doesn't have a read method, we can't call json.load
FileModel with unicode filename and data #########################
FileSystemFinder searched locations
FileSystemStorage fallbacks to MEDIA_ROOT when location is empty, so we restore the empty value.
Files can be read in a little at a time, if necessary.
Files can be written to.
Files that aren't added to a sources or frameworks build phase can still go into the project file, just not as part of a build phase.
Files that have no dependencies are treated as dependent on root_node.
Filesystem path to the application directory eg.
Fill the apps cached property
Film is not available.
Film is not playable in your area.
Film wording is used instead of Episode
Filter by resources, if any
Filter down a queryset from self.queryset using the date from the URL.
Filter geom by raster.
Filter in an unprojected coordinate system.
Filter junk out of stdout, and write filtered versions.
Filter options to params accepted by `_ogrinspect`
Filter out all expressions associated with a table's primary key present in the grouped columns.
Filter out comm and command column and then append it to the end so that we can use space as delimiter.
Filter out empty strings.
Filter out non-error logging so we don't have to capture it in lots of tests.
Filter out objects in the future if appropriate.
Filter out those which do not match prefix and suffix and produce the resulting list without prefix and suffix.
Filter raster by geom.
Filter raster with different lookup raster formats.
Filter the system libraries, which are added by default by the Android build system.
Filter through conditional statements.
Filter through different lookup.
Filter through related model with band index transform
Filter through related model.
Filter with band index transform.
Filtered variables should reject access of attributes beginning with underscores.
Filtering and deleting works
Filters against the parent model return objects of the parent's type.
Filters and updates in one query.
Filters are allowed if explicitly included in list_filter
Filters must never raise exceptions, and pytz' exceptions inherit Exception directly, not a specific subclass.
Filters out m2m objects from reverse relations.
Filters should be allowed if they are defined on a ForeignKey pointing to this model
Filters should be allowed if they involve a local field without the need to whitelist them in list_filter or date_hierarchy.
Finalize1 is responsible for sorting duty, and once all project files are sorted, Finalize2 can come in and update these references.
Finalize2 needs to happen in a separate step because the process of updating references to other projects depends on the ordering of targets within remote project files.
Finally do cleanup - get rid of the joins we created above.
Finally link the file
Finally start copying
Finally store the processed paths
Finally test that filtering works.
Finally the value can of course be just plain Python value.
Finally, a more complex case, one time in a way where each NOT is pushed to lowest level in the boolean tree, and another query where this isn't done.
Finally, add all top-level groups as children of 'all'.
Finally, add the importer to the meta path import hook.
Finally, because of the (some would say boneheaded) way pickle works, the underlying FieldFile might not actually itself have an associated file.
Finally, call super().
Finally, fall back and assume it's a URL
Finally, look for a named method on the admin site
Finally, make sure we got a Geographic field and return.
Finally, make the operation, deduping any dependencies
Finally, remove the model.
Finally, setting the extra selection attribute with the format string expanded with the stored procedure arguments.
Finally, the .so extension is forcibly applied over the default (.dylib), unless another forced extension is already selected.
Finally, the widget should have the 'radiolist' attr, and 'inline' as well if the field is specified HORIZONTAL.
Finally, we apply the remaining lookup parameters from the query string (i.e. those that haven't already been processed by the filters).
Finally, we use the prett xml function to print the vcproj back to the user.
Finally, wrap the whole thing in quotes so that the above quote rule applies and whitespace isn't a word break.

For Android, the target of these maps is a tuple ('static', 'modulename'), ('dynamic', 'modulename'), or ('path', 'some/path') instead of a string, since we link by module.
For CharFields, it's set to the empty string.
For Cocoa to find the locale at runtime, it needs to use '_' instead of '-' (http://crbug.com/20441).
For DateFields, it's set to None.
For IsValid lookups, boolean values are allowed.
For MSVS 2008 and earlier, we need to process all files before walking the sub folders.
For Oracle '' is equivalent to null.
For POST requests, we insist on a CSRF cookie, and in this way we can avoid all CSRF attacks, including login CSRF.
For Python 2 compatibility
For Python 2 gettext() (#25720)
For RTMP URLs, also include the playpath
For Select fields, all of the choices lists have a first entry of dashes.
For a complete list of original driver names see http://www.gdal.org/ogr_formats.html (vector) http://www.gdal.org/formats_list.html (raster)
For a detailed format description see mnttab(4) special mount_point fstype options time
For a list of options available for each theme, see the documentation.
For a literal quote, CommandLineToArgv requires an odd number of backslashes preceding it, and it produces half as many literal backslashes (rounded down).
For a literal quote, CommandLineToArgvW requires 2n+1 backslashes preceding it, and results in n backslashes + the quote.
For a non-literal quote, CommandLineToArgv requires an even number of backslashes preceding it, and it produces half as many literal backslashes.
For a variant path/to/Language.lproj/MainMenu.nib, put a variant group named MainMenu.nib inside path/to, and give it a variant named Language.
For all direct related models recursively get all related models.
For all possible True/False combinations of follow and secure
For any class that is a proxy (including automatically created classes for deferred object loading), proxy_for_model tells us which class this model is proxying.
For any generated source, if it is coming from the shared intermediate directory then we add a Make rule to copy them to the local intermediate directory first.
For any non-abstract class, the concrete class is the model in the end of the proxy_for_model chain.
For any other type of field, just call its formfield() method.
For any requests that come in with that header/value, request.is_secure() will return True.
For articles, the id in the url is not the video id
For backwards compatibility (was the change url before 1.9)
For backwards compatibility purposes, we need to *try* and set the to_field during FK construction.
For backwards compatibility, interpret -1 as whole list
For backwards compatibility, interpret naive datetimes in local time.
For backwards compatibility.
For backwards-compatibility.
For both metadata and downloaded files the duration varies among formats.
For both the 2D and 3D MultiLineString, ensure _both_ the dimension of the collection and the component LineString have the expected coordinate dimension after transform.
For bundles, the .TOC should be produced for the binary, not for FinalOutput().
For compatibility with existing code, parse the message into an email.Message object if it is not one already.
For consistency w/PostGIS API
For consistency with SQLiteCursorWrapper.execute(), just return sql when there are no parameters.
For consistency with other builders, put sub-project build output in the sub-project dir (see test/subdirectory/gyptest-subdir-all.py).
For consistency, you should be able to pass "foo_id" in the fields list and have it work, too.
For convenience we create empty caches even if they are not used.
For convenience, store other field-related data here too.
For deferred models this isn't the same as all attnames of the model's fields.
For doing the join in Python, we have to match both the FK val and the content type, so we use a callable that returns a (fk, class) pair.
For each app, print its migrations in order from oldest (roots) to newest (leaves).
For each dependencies in this project
For each linkable target, add a "dependencies" entry referring to all of the target's computed list of link dependencies (including static libraries if no such entry is already present.
For each node, take a copy, and remove it from the list.
For each remote project file, sort the associated ProductGroup in the same order that the targets are sorted in the remote project file.
For each source file, write an edge that generates all the outputs.
For each static library target, remove "dependencies" entries referring to other static libraries, unless the dependency has the "hard_dependency" attribute set.
For efficiency, group the instances by content type and then do one query per model
For every non-leap year century, advance by 6 years to get into the 28-year repeat cycle
For example another WhereNode
For example qs.iterator() could be passed as qs, but it does not have 'ordered' attribute.
For example, 'server_hostname' becomes '--system.hostname'.
For example, Poll.objects works, but poll_obj.objects raises AttributeError.
For example, a Point column would be converted to MultiPoint.
For example, a database column can be specified by up to 4 levels: database.schema.table.column
For example, an action may have inputs in /usr/include, which are not in the source tree.
For example, here are a series of host definitions in a group:
For example, if a field is eligible to use the BooleanFieldListFilter, that'd be much more appropriate, and the AllValuesFieldListFilter won't get used for it.
For example, if a method call is suggested, this chunk will be equal to the method return type.
For example, if you filter on employee__department__id, then the id value would be found already from employee__department_id.
For example, proxied ungettext calls require a count parameter and are converted to an empty string if they are missing it.
For example, this allows unused code to appear as a warning instead of an error.
For example, this gets the primary key value of object "obj":
For example, to dump the API for all frameworks across OS X, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS, with the Swift 3 rules, use:
For example, to get stats for Spanish in contrib.admin, run:
For explicit "through" M2M fields, do nothing For everything else, remake.
For exporting to WKT, PROJ.4, "Pretty" WKT, and XML.
For filtering out modules correctly below
For formatting consistent w/the GeoRSS simple standard: http://georss.org/1.0#simple
For freeing memory allocated within a record
For if/for/while/switch, the left and right parens should be consistent about how many spaces are inside the parens, and there should either be zero or one spaces inside the parens.
For implicit M2M tables, delete the auto-created table
For include(...) processing.
For inventory-wide caching
For join promotion this case is doing an AND for the added q_object and existing conditions.
For large querysets, the instantiation of all GDALRasters can potentially be expensive.
For legacy reasons, the fields property should only contain forward fields that are not private or with a m2m cardinality.
For lookups spanning over relationships, show the error from the model on which the lookup failed.
For marking tests as always failing.
For migration, stop the forever monitor processes of Nuclide server.
For monetary numbers, the DECIMAL_SEPARATOR is a .

For more robustness we also check it to be mp4 audio.
For most actions, add 'call' so that actions that invoke batch files return and continue executing.
For multicolumn lookups we need to build a multicolumn where clause.
For non-autocreated 'through' models, can't assume we are dealing with PK values.
For non-field values, the value is either a method, property or returned via a callable.
For non-proxy models, the variable is always None.
For non-raw_id fields, wrap the widget with a wrapper that adds extra HTML -- the "add other" interface -- to the end of the rendered output.
For now assume non HTTP(S) URLs always valid
For now only return check mode, but we can easily return more options if we need variables for them
For now the behavior chrome needs is the default.
For now we do not warn for this case.
For now, return a dummy resource tree so various initializations in client happens.
For now, the best way to create a FormSet is by using the formset_factory function.
For now, we always just prompt the user.
For now, we don't do any special validation on these types:
For out of memory drivers, check filename argument
For people who have already setup func and that wish to play with ansible, this permit to move gradually to ansible without having to redo completely the setup of the network.
For performance, only add a from_db_value() method if the base field implements it.
For performance, we use the cached FQDN for local_hostname.
For plays, we simply parse them using the Play() object, and includes are parsed using the PlaybookInclude() object
For possible shortcuts see django.core.mail.
For preserving the number of input newlines in the output (used later in this method)
For pro videos or player.vimeo.com urls We try to find out to which variable is assigned the config dic
For pulling out the spheroid from the spatial reference string.
For pulling out the units on platforms w/o GDAL installed.
For purposes of seeing whether something has changed, None is the same as an empty string, if the data or initial value we get is None, replace it with ''.
For quoting column values, rather than columns.
For raster fields, assure input is None or a string, dict, or raster instance.
For raster fields, wrap index creation SQL statement with ST_ConvexHull.
For rasters, add explicit type cast to WKB string.
For reasons I don't quite understand, without a __module__ the created class appears to "live" in the wrong place, which causes issues later on.
For reasons of convention, the Android build system requires that all shared library modules are named 'libfoo' when generating -l flags.
For relational fields, use the output_field of the 'field' attribute.
For replacement migrations, record individual statuses
For retrieving records by name or address.
For retrieving the envelope of the geometry.
For routines that return a string.
For singly related objects, we have to avoid getting the attribute from the object, as this will trigger the query.
For some akamai manifests we'll need to add a query to the fragment url
For some reason SpatiaLite does something screwy with the Texas geometry here.
For some reason this was thought to be malformed.
For some videos actual video id (prid) is different (e.g. for http://www.omroepwnl.nl/video/fragment/vandaag-de-dag-verkiezingen__POMS_WNL_853698 video id is POMS_WNL_853698 but prid is POW_00996502)
For static libraries, no dSYMs are created.
For subprocess calls, encode with locale encoding Refer to http://stackoverflow.com/a/9951851/35070
For supp tables, perform bottom-up deduplication: first, deduplicate data blocks.
For systems where memory details aren't sent to syslog or the log has rotated, use parsed adb output.
For temporary backwards compatibility, try to compare with a relative url
For test-module script to tell this is a ZIPLOADER_WRAPPER This code is part of Ansible, but is an independent component.
For testing #13085 fix, we also use Note model defined above
For testing HEX(EWKB).
For testing field and non-field errors
For testing method_decorator, a decorator that assumes a single argument.
For testing method_decorator, two decorators that add an attribute to the function
For testing non-form errors
For testing the codes to add parameters
For the OR case, if all children voted for a join to be inner, then we can use INNER for the join.
For the cache_db session backend to always use the current session, memcached needs to delete the old key if it fails to set.
For the most part, we assume that platform.dist() will tell the truth.
For the next half, try different modes.
For the purposes of this regression test, it's important that there is no Join object related to the LeafA we create.
For the remainder of this test, create a copy of 'mark' in the 'default' database to prevent integrity errors on backends that don't defer constraints checks until the end of the transaction
For the rest, work with both comments and strings removed.
For the units authority, have to use the pipe symbole.
For this use case, make VaultFile a context manager instead (implement __enter__ and __exit__)
For this we need to check what came before the "(type)" string.
For those wishing to disable the imports.
For unknown reasons, sometimes the list returned by __path__ contains duplicates that must be removed (#25246).
For urls like http://m.tvpot.daum.net/v/65139429, where the video_id is really a clipid
For values set to None explicitly, return None instead as that allows a user to unset a parameter
For zeros at the beginning of the address.
For zeros at the end of the address.
Forbid URLs like http:///example.com - with a scheme, but without a hostname.
Forbid URLs that start with control characters.
Force a re-parse, in case the user e.g. changed a header file.
Force a reload if it's already loaded (tests need this)
Force a transaction on a non-transactional-DDL backend or an atomic operation inside a non-atomic migration.

Force evaluation of the lazy object.
Force ints to unicode
Force looking up the content types in the current database before creating foreign keys to them.
Force ninja to use rsp files.
Force queryset evaluation with list()
Force queryset evaluation with list() Note that this doesn't cause an infinite loop, since the default ordering on the Tag model is empty (and thus defaults to using "id" for the related field).
Force refreshing translations.
Force the cache to be fully populated.
Force this manager to be the first and thus default
Force to safe, then back (also showing why using force_escape too early in a chain can lead to unexpected results).
Force using win32 python on cygwin.
Force-convert all options to text_type (#23226)
Forces process_response to send the cookie
Forces the book table to alter the FK
Forcing binary mode may be revisited after dropping Python 2 support (see #22399)
Forcing possible reverse_lazy evaluation
Foreign Keys being used to represent inline relationships are excluded from basic field value validation.
Foreign key constraints
Foreign keys pointing to this model, both from m2m and other models.
ForeignKey can become updated with the value of another ForeignKey.
ForeignKey is a special case since the field will actually be a descriptor that returns the other object
ForeignKey or ManyToManyFields
ForeignKey to BasePerson
ForeignKey to ProxyPerson
ForeignKey widgets in the admin are wrapped with RelatedFieldWidgetWrapper so they need to be handled properly when type checking.
ForeignKey's use another mapping dictionary for the _related_ Model (State in this case).
ForeignObject is not part of public API.
ForeignObjects should not have any form fields, currently the user needs to manually deal with the foreignobject relation.
Fork # of forks, # of hosts or serial, whichever is lowest
Forking automatically makes a copy of an in-memory database.
Form media can be combined to produce a single media definition.
Form.clean() is run even if other validation fails, so do the same with Model.clean() for consistency.
Form.errors will be an empty dictionary *but* Form.is_valid() will return False.
FormSet allows us to use multiple instance of the same form on 1 page.
FormSet clean hook ########################################################## FormSets have a hook for doing extra validation that shouldn't be tied to any particular form.
FormSet has an is_valid method, and a cleaned_data or errors attribute depending on whether all the forms passed validation.
FormSet instances can also have an error attribute if validation failed for any of the forms.
FormSet instances has_changed method will be True if any data is passed to his forms, even if the formset didn't validate
FormSets with deletion ###################################################### We can easily add deletion ability to a FormSet with an argument to formset_factory.
FormSets with ordering ###################################################### We can also add ordering ability to a FormSet with an argument to formset_factory.
FormSets with ordering + deletion ########################################### Let's try throwing ordering and deletion into the same form.
Format can be a custom python file, or by default the name of a module within gyp.generator.
Format dependencies and write out swappable dependencies right
Format imports nicely, swapping imports of functions from migration files for comments
Format of Accept-Language header values.
Format upgrade_check_project_version with leading zeros as needed.
Format: (data type, PK value, Model Class, data)
Formats asset search query to locate assets matching attributes, using the CQL search feature as described here: http://tumblr.github.io/collins/recipes.html
Formats must be opposite (video+audio)
Formfield initial values ######## If the model has default values for some fields, they are used as the formfield initial values.
Forms can also define media, following the same rules as widgets.
Formsets can override the default iteration order
Fortunately, for most symboles, we do not need to perform a function call.
Fortunately, master playlist can be easily distinguished from media playlist based on particular tags availability.
Fortunately, this logic is very fast, so it doesn't seem like we'll have to make it multi-threaded any time soon, so we can get away with sharing this field.
Fortunately, to match the implementation of allow_future, we need __lte, which doesn't conflict with __lt above.
Forward declared intermediate model
Found DISALLOW* macro outside a class declaration, or perhaps it was used inside a function when it should have been part of the class declaration.
Found an operator, update nesting stack
Found matching angle bracket
Found something - we'll let openssl autonegotiate and hope the server has disabled sslv2 and 3.
Found the end of the string, match leading space for this line and resume copying the original lines, and also insert a "" on the last line.
Four forms are instantiated and no exception is raised
Frame opcodes defined in the spec.
Frames vars are never shown in plain text email reports.
Frames vars are shown in html email reports.
FrameworksGroup and ProjectsGroup are top-level groups used to collect frameworks and projects.
Free up all file handles.
FreeBSD has options like this...
FreeBSD, DragonflyBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and OS X all implicitly add '-a' when running the command 'ifconfig'.
Freeing the memory allocated within GEOS
Fresh init tests don't care about which files changed, so we can just use the default .hhconfig in the template repo

Grandparent has geometry field.
Great idea borrowed from http://community.cgcookie.com/t/code-snippet-easy-error-messages/203
Grit intentionally doesn't touch the timestamp of its output file when the file doesn't change, which is fine in hash-based dependency systems like scons and forge, but not kosher in the make world.

Gyp source paths are always posix.
Gyp traditionally names the object resulting from foo.c foo.o.

GypPathToUniqueOutput generates a path relative to the product dir, so insert product_dir in front if it is provided.
HACK: The default implementations of os.path.expanduser from cpython do not decode environment variables with filesystem encoding.
HACK: The following are the correct unquote_to_bytes, unquote and unquote_plus implementations from cpython 3.4.3's stdlib.
HACK: This depends on internals of our TestCase subclasses
HACK: We have no way of executing python byte compiled files as ansible modules so specifically exclude them
HACK: because powershell modules are in the same directory hierarchy as other modules we have to process them last.
HACK: datetime is an old-style class, create a new-style equivalent so we can define additional attributes.
HACK: the convert_to_local_time flag will prevent automatic conversion of the value to local time.
HEXEWKB should be appropriate for its dimension -- have to use an a WKBWriter w/dimension set accordingly, else GEOS will insert garbage into 3D coordinate if there is none.

Hence actual testing that exception was properly handled is done by relying on got_request_exception signal being sent.
Hence this paranoid conversion to create a valid cache key.
Hence we can safely use INNER join.
Hence we have to add the private fields separately from the topmost call.
Hence, some targets use copies for this.
Hence, the distinct removes one rating of 4.0 from the results.
Hence, there is no reliance on model._meta.app_label here, just using the model fields instead.
Here X, Y, and (optionally) Z were passed in individually, as parameters.
Here a tuple or list was passed in under the `x` parameter.
Here and below 'supp' stands for 'supplementary characters'.
Here are the categories.
Here colspan is "4": two fields (title1 and title2), one hidden field and the delete checkbox.
Here comes the crazy part: In 2.6, if the xpath is a unicode, .//node does not match if a node is a direct child of .
Here goes the name and then ".html"
Here parse_cookie() differs from Python's cookie parsing in that it treats all semicolons as delimiters, even within quotes.
Here pre 18375 the amount of joins generated was random if dict randomization was enabled, that is the generated query dependent on which clause was seen first.
Here we are figuring out the path to the SpatiaLite library (`libspatialite`).
Here we can just use a shallow copy since we are the last reference to it.
Here we check if the storage backend has a post_process method and pass it the list of modified files.
Here we generate a list of all acceptable HTTP referers, including the current host since that has been validated upstream.
Here we have to check if it's layeredtextures, or just textures:
Here we have two clashed: id (automatic field) and clash, because both parents define these fields.
Here we set up the parameters that will be passed in to field's function.
Here we set up the prototypes for the initGEOS_r and finishGEOS_r routines.
Here we test with a timezone on the negative side.
Here's some real nastiness: Another "instance" of the six module might be floating around.
Here's the basic steps:
Here's the default case.
Here, we define a custom ModelForm.

Here, we make sure we're only catching this specific case and not another ImproperlyConfigured one.
Here, we skip any indexes across multiple fields.
Here, we will look at possible includes.
Here, we're not submitting any data, so the initial value will be displayed.)

However allowing any language seems to workaround the issue.
However by recursing on __bases__ we may end up with duplicates and ordering issues, we therefore discard any duplicates and reorder the bases according to their index in the MRO.
However if the same fragment is immediately retried with the same request data this usually succeeds (1-2 attemps is usually enough) thus allowing to download the whole file successfully.
However it's still important to strip trailing slashes.
However saving the object is not allowed.
However the current cookie parser doesn't do this and fixing it is much more work than fixing #20557.
However they are found in CL and other tools.
However this check is done only when the query executes, so you can use distinct() to remove the fields before execution.
However we don't want tblib to be required for running the tests when they pass or fail as expected.
However, CMake does provide the command link_directories, which adds link directories to targets defined after it is called.
However, Chrome will still consider example.com to be the hostname, so we must not allow this syntax.
However, IncrediBuild BuildConsole will parse the solution file, but then silently skip building the target causing hard to track down errors.
However, Jython doesn't support buffer (see http://bugs.jython.org/issue1521), so we have to be careful.
However, NaN is the only value that isn't equal to itself, so we can use this to identify NaN
However, a reference should still be kept alive on the `Layer` returned.
However, an exception FieldDoesNotExist will be thrown if you specify a non-existent field name in values() (a field that is neither in the model nor in extra(select)).
However, clearing the select clause can alter results if distinct is used.
However, do apply checks if there is already an end of namespace comment and it's incorrect.
However, excluding GenericRelations means your lookups have to be a bit more explicit.
However, fake-apply one migration and it should now use the old two
However, for a test we still would like to download just a piece of a file.
However, hds and hls uris are still available.
However, if database sequences are reused (e.g. in the test suite after flush/syncdb), it isn't guaranteed that the next id will be 1, so we coerce it.
However, if we are annotating over a column of a related model, then it might be that column isn't part of the SELECT clause of the inner query, and we must manually make sure the column is selected.
However, in some cases, especially when multiple projects are open or when Xcode is busy, things don't work so seamlessly.
However, in that case the system will trigger an error with the level E_NOTICE
However, in this case the parent data isn't necessarily in the same order that Model.__init__ expects it to be, so we have to reorder the parent data.
However, related_model is a cached property, and all the models haven't been loaded yet, so we need to make sure we don't cache a string reference.
However, starting at 3 or 4 we'd need to use non-existing migrations
However, starting at 3 to 5 cannot use the squashed migration
However, that would make this class harder to subclass.
However, the CommonInfo class cannot be used as a normal model (it doesn't exist as a model).

However, the specific kind of the declaration is not reported.
However, the specific kind of the expression is not reported.
However, the specific kind of the statement is not reported.
However, the view should NOT pass any user object on a form if the password reset link was invalid.
However, these characters must be included in the original query in case the query is being passed to SQL*Plus.
However, these fields *must* be included in uniqueness checks, so this can't be part of _get_validation_exclusions().
However, these tests expect warnings to be logged, so manually force warnings to the logs.
However, this adversely affects performance (i.e., Java is called to convert to WKT on every query).
However, this depends on the GDAL Driver in use.
However, unlike a Form instance, cleaned_data and errors will be a list of dicts rather than just a single dict.
However, users might want to have some say over which of /tmp or /var/tmp is used (because /tmp may be a tmpfs and want to conserve RAM or persist the tmp files beyond a reboot.
However, we *really* need to be sure we are checking for None as any data in initial that returns False on a boolean call needs to be treated literally.
However, we need the 'normal' action handler for the status check, so get it now via the action_loader
However, we need to ensure that we *always* do this.
However, we often build compilation units from header files here, so avoid the nag.
However: PyPy's own StringBuilder is fastest.
Hstore is not available on the database.

ISO formats are accepted, even if not specified in formats.py
Ideally this would modify every non-primary file, but that's harder to infer without actually parsing the arguments.
Ideally we should fetch the underlying value content and display (key, value) so user does not need to expand one more level to examine content.
Ideas for the harness improvement and development are welcomed here: rdar://problem/18072938
Identically named callable isn't present in the parent ModelAdmin, rendering of the add view shouldn't explode

If 'fr-ca' is not supported, try special fallback or language-only 'fr'.
If 'obj' is a class, the 'name' is required to be the name of the method that will be decorated.

If HEX, unpack input to a binary buffer.
If Http500 handler is not installed, re-raise last exception
If NULL is implied on columns without needing to be explicitly specified
If None, check if the migration has any dependencies to determine if there are dependencies to tell if db introspection needs to be done.

If QUERY_STRING is absent or empty, we want to extract it from the URL.
If SRID is a string, e.g., '4326', then make acceptable as user input.
If SRID was passed in with the keyword arguments
If Template is instantiated directly rather than from an Engine and exactly one Django template engine is configured, use that engine.
If True it will raise an error if no login info is provided
If True, always perform introspection.
If True, don't use integer foreign keys referring to, e.g., positive integer primary keys.
If `None`, the return value of 'django.core.wsgi.get_wsgi_application' is used, thus preserving the same behavior as previous versions of Django.
If `idx' is a string, it must be converted to an index via the underlying FixedStringMap.
If `value` is naive, astimezone() will raise a ValueError, so we don't need to perform a redundant check.
If a "BSD Dynamic Library" target is added in the Xcode UI, Xcode sets EXECUTABLE_PREFIX.
If a "name" property was supplied, set "productName" if it is not present.
If a 'none' target has rules or actions we assume it requires a build.
If a FQDN was passed in.
If a Form defines 'initial' *and* 'initial' is passed as a parameter to Form(), then the latter will get precedence.
If a FormSet was not passed any data, its is_valid and has_changed methods should return False.
If a GEOS geometry isn't passed in, try to construct one.
If a GeoRSS box was given via tuple.
If a URLRegexResolver doesn't have a namespace or app_name, it passes in an empty value.
If a ValuesList or Values queryset is passed as an inner query, we make sure it's only requesting a single value and use that as the thing to select.
If a build file (or any of its included files) is modified we assume all targets in the file are modified.
If a colon ':' is found, parse
If a column type is set to None, it won't be included in the output.
If a context handle does not exist for this thread, initialize one.
If a database isn't specified, the read database is used
If a field is not given in the data then None is returned for its data.
If a file has been provided previously, then the form doesn't require that a new file is provided this time.
If a file is posted, the dummy client should only post the file name, not the full path.
If a label is set to the empty string for a field, that field won't get a label.
If a local field has already been created, use it instead of promoting the parent
If a mapping is specified as a collection, all OGR fields that are not collections will be converted into them.
If a method has no arguments, show it as a 'field', otherwise as a 'method with arguments'.
If a migration fails to serialize, it shouldn't generate an empty file.
If a model has been explicitly provided, use it
If a model is defined, extract form fields from it.
If a non-related field is used like a relation, or if a single non-relational field is given.
If a number is duplicated in the set of ordering fields, for instance form 0 and form 3 are both marked as 1, then the form index used as a secondary ordering criteria.
If a pk isn't editable, then it won't be on the form, so we need to add it here so we can tell which object is which when we get the data back.
If a prefix was specified, add a filter
If a relative path, parsed_build_file is relative to the directory containing build_file.
If a rule specifies multiple outputs, each input file that the rule is applied to will have the same number of concrete outputs.
If a source file gets copied, we still need to add the orginal source directory as header search path, for GCC searches headers in the directory that contains the source file by default.
If a string name of the driver was passed in
If a string reaches here (via a validation error on another field) then just reconstruct the Geometry.
If a tuple/list passed in as first element of args, then assume
If a widget extends another but defines media, it extends the parent widget's media by default
If a widget extends another but defines media, it extends the parents widget's media, even if the parent defined media using a property.
If all configurations don't define the 'SYMROOT' attribute, an empty set is returned.
If all files have dependencies, add the first file as a dependent of root_node so that the cycle can be discovered from root_node.
If all of the available hashing methods fail we fail with an rc of 0.
If all of the models in the dependency list are either already on the final model list, or not on the original serialization list, then we've found another model with all it's dependencies satisfied.
If all targets have dependencies, add the first target as a dependent of root_node so that the cycle can be discovered from root_node.
If all that malarkey found an object domain, use it.
If all the dependencies of a given model are in the final list, that model is promoted to the end of the final list.
If allow_empty is True, the naive result will be valid
If an IP address was passed in
If an add form was marked for deletion, make sure we don't save that form.
If an annotation isn't included in the values, it can still be used in a filter
If an exception other than DataError or IntegrityError occurred since the last commit / rollback, check if the connection works.
If an exception was silenced in ManagementUtility.execute in order to be raised in the child process, raise it now.
If another PBXBuildFile references this XCFileLikeElement, there's a problem.
If any concrete outputs are outdated or missing relative to their corresponding rule_source or to any specified additional input, the rule action must be performed to generate the concrete outputs.
If any configuration doesn't define the 'SYMROOT' attribute, None is added to the returned set.
If any non-native rules use 'idl' as an extension exclude idl files.
If any of the new or altered fields is introducing a new PK, remove the old one
If any of the resulting tokens are not compile time constants then report the error.
If any of the root targets match, we remove it and replace it with 'all'.
If any of the values are not given as parameters, check the appropriate environment variables.
If any of these conditions is not true then the shim logic will fail below.
If any of these happen, just return an empty dictionary (an empty session).
If any of these happen, reset the session.
If anything else we use /tmp (because /tmp is specified by POSIX nad /var/tmp is not).
If anything was excluded, put the excluded list into the_dict at excluded_key.
If app_labels is specified, filter out conflicting migrations for unspecified apps
If appending a singleton that's already in the list, don't append.
If apps registry is not ready, get_field() searches over only forward fields.
If argument is not a `SpatialReference` instance, use it as parameter to construct a `SpatialReference` instance.
If arguments are being passed in construction, it's being used as a decorator.
If asked to recurse, recurse.
If auto_id is any False value, an "id" attribute won't be output unless it was manually entered.
If both a zoom level and a center coordinate are provided with polygons/polylines, no automatic determination will occur.
If both groups are in the listed order, go by the defined order.
If braces come on one side of an else, they should be on both.
If build_file is a symlink, we must not follow it because there's a chance it could point to a path above toplevel_dir, and we cannot correctly deal with that case at the moment.
If build_file is just a leaf filename indicating a file in the current directory, build_file_dir might be an empty string.
If build_file is not in the current directory, parsed_build_file is not a usable path as-is.
If committing, save the instance and the m2m data immediately.
If compiling the template we found raises TemplateDoesNotExist, back off to returning the source and display name for the template we were asked to load.
If connection.operators is looked up before a connection has been created, transparently initialize connection.operators to avert an AttributeError.
If connector is AND and there is a filter that can match only when there is a joinable row, then use INNER.
If constraints aren't supported by the database, there's the unavoidable risk of data corruption.
If content comes to us as a dict it should be decoded json.
If content is defined make a temp file and write the content into it.
If content_type restriction isn't in the query's join condition, then wrong results are produced here as the link to b will also match (b and hs1 have equal pks).
If contrib.staticfiles isn't configured properly, the exception should bubble up to the main thread.
If cpplint is invoked from Emacs's flymake, a temporary file is generated by flymake and that file name might end with '_flymake.cc'.
If current_file is not set, we reach the last line of report, which contains the summarized coverage percentage.
If data is too large, socket will choke, so write chunks no larger than 32MB at a time.
If database has been updated, reload filehandle and/or memory cache.
If database is in memory, closing the connection destroys the database.
If depth is set, predefine the DEPTH variable to be a relative path from this build file's directory to the directory identified by depth.
If dumpdata is outputting to stdout, there is no way to display progress
If either of those conditions are met, we break out, otherwise we only break out if the entire batch failed
If empty file, use default config
If exclude is an empty list we use None, since that's the actual default.
If explicitly set to preprocess the plist, invoke the C preprocessor and specify any defines as -D flags.
If explicitly setting allow_thread_sharing to False
If explicitly setting allow_thread_sharing to True
If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory, add these directories to sys.path here.
If false, no module index is generated.
If file non-existent, use default config
If geodetic defaulting distance attribute to meters (Oracle and PostGIS spherical distances return meters).
If georestricted, there are no embedded data, so an extra request is necessary to get the error code
If given a file name, get a real handle.
If given port is being used by somebody else, you shall not pass.
If hidden fields should be included or the relation is not intentionally hidden, add to the fields dict.
If hyperthreading is active divide cores by 2
If i18n or l10n are used, the generated cache key will be suffixed with the current locale.
If id attribute is missing it's valid for all media nodes without drmAdditionalHeaderId or drmAdditionalHeaderSetId attribute
If image assigned to None, dimension fields should be cleared.
If import_module succeeds, entry is a path to an app module, which may specify an app config class with default_app_config.
If importing as an app config class fails too, we'll trigger the ImportError again.
If importing as an app module failed, that error probably contains the most informative traceback.
If initial is passed in, it's a list of related objects, but the MultipleChoiceField takes a list of IDs.
If initialized, return a copy of the wrapped object.
If input is a valid file path, try setting file as source.
If invoked in non-primary-file mode, it only creates the output file.
If is_geo_restricted is true, it doesn't necessarily mean we can't download it
If is_strong is True, each element is an XCObject, so it's safe to call Copy.
If it does not already exist, an empty placeholder file is created.
If it does, the blank value may be included in a unique check, so cannot be excluded from validation.
If it does, this inventory module will connect to all of them and present them as one contiguous inventory.
If it doesn't appear to be a reloaded module then we expect a RuntimeError.
If it doesn't, it could still be a single pattern.
If it ever needs to move backwards, CheckNextIncludeOrder will raise an error.
If it has its own cursor, close it.
If it is a file, it means that we are in a submodule structure.
If it is a model class or anything else with ._default_manager
If it is false, this method returns a path to the symlink.
If it is not provided at all, we need to use middleware defaults.
If it is, We can just use the fact we already have that imported, otherwise, we need to add an import for the operation class.
If it isn't any of the above, we don't understand it.
If it returns a file object, then set the files dict.
If it uses an intermediary model that isn't auto created, don't show a field in admin.
If it was specified on the command line, definitely true
If it's STILL too long, just hash it down
If it's a callable, call it
If it's a model, use get_absolute_url()
If it's a string, append a text node.
If it's a string, it should be base64-encoded data
If it's a wrapper (bundle), set WRAPPER_EXTENSION.
If it's a zone check if we can detect if our global zone is itself virtualized.
If it's already a list, make a copy.
If it's already a settings reference, error
If it's already a settings reference, error.
If it's disabled in any config, turn it off in the reference.
If it's equal, we leave it untouched, otherwise we concatenate it.
If it's got commas in it, we'll treat it as a straightforward comma-separated list of patterns.
If it's irreversible, error out
If it's not a valid directory name.
If it's not in the system library path (e.g., it cannot be found by `ctypes.util.find_library`), then it may be set manually in the settings via the `SPATIALITE_LIBRARY_PATH` setting.
If it's not set, we don't want to leave the unexpanded variable in the path, so simply strip it.
If it's not yet migrated or has no migrations, we use __first__
If it's recursive copy, destination is always a dir, explicitly mark it so (note - copy module relies on this).
If it's wrapped with quotes (single or double), then we're also dealing with a literal.
If item is a relative path, it's relative to the build file dict that it's coming from.
If item is option 3, it should be a ListFilter...
If label is None, Django will auto-create the label from the field name.
If left empty, will default to the dummy backend.
If list_display_links not defined, add the link tag to the first field
If local_checksum is not defined we can't find the file so we should fail out.
If local_hostname is not specified, socket.getfqdn() gets used.
If login_user or login_password are given, they should override the config file
If max_num is 0 then no form is rendered at all, regardless of extra, unless initial data is present.
If max_num is 0 then no form is rendered at all.
If mimetype suggests the file is text but it's actually binary, read() will raise a UnicodeDecodeError on Python 3.
If models import exists, merge it with migrations import.
If namespace or class hasn't seen a opening brace yet, mark namespace/class head as complete.
If nativePlatform is None a fallback mechanism is used (i.e. youtube embed)
If needed, transform the geometry in the srid of the global geojson srid
If needed, unpack the IPv4 and return straight away - no need in running the rest of the algorithm
If new operator, then this isn't a cast
If no URL scheme given, assume http://
If no arguments are passed in construction, it's being used as middleware.
If no browsers were specified, skip this class (it'll still be discovered).
If no column specified, we will get all columns.
If no depth variable was set on the command line, try to find a "src" directory by looking at the absolute path to each build file's directory.
If no existing servers, find an open port.
If no format was given on the command line, then check the env variable.
If no locations specified, then we try to build for every model in installed applications.
If no password change, session key should not be flushed.
If no project is given, get all projects the requesting user has access to
If no rsync_path is set, become was originally set, and dest is remote then add privilege escalation here.
If no specific override, use the configuration's.
If none are found, we raise an error, which is silently ignored at this point.
If none of the above matches, return 'NA' for virtualization_type and virtualization_role.
If none of those are defined, it's an error.
If not '', a 'Last updated on:' timestamp is inserted at every page bottom, using the given strftime format.
If not already processed then we've got work to do
If not committing, add a method to the form to allow deferred saving of m2m data.
If not implemented in a particular backend cache.close is a no-op
If not in the cache, then read the file into the cache We already have a file handle for the module open so it makes sense to read it now
If not properly quoted digits would be interpreted as an int.
If not provided, create the user with an unusable password
If not, obey the cookie rules.
If not, this is the first trip through ITERATING_SETUP, so we set the pending_setup flag and try to determine if we do in fact want to gather facts for the specified host.
If not, we'll be a good little HTTP citizen and redirect back to the changelist page.
If not, we'll try our cache, and get_template()
If nothing's selected, we can't perform an action on it, so bail.
If numpy, convert result to list
If one but not all certificate files are given.
If only one argument provided, set the coords array appropriately
If only one geometry provided or a list of geometries is provided in the first argument.
If out_path is a directory and we're expecting a file, bail out now.
If packages are not provided, default to all installed packages, as DjangoTranslation without localedirs harvests them all.
If parameter has `input_size` attribute, use that.
If parent form class already has an inner Meta, the Meta we're creating needs to inherit from the parent's inner meta.
If parsed_build_file is absolute, it is usable as a path regardless of the current directory, and os.path.join will return it as-is.
If path is already just a leaf name, name will not be set.
If path is set and name is not, name may have a default value.
If port is given, match it.
If port not specified, skip port check and add to result list.
If port_filter is given, only list servers in that list.
If possible, try an UPDATE.
If prepending a singleton that's already in the list, remove the existing instance and proceed with the prepend.
If preserve default is off, don't use the default for future state
If previous line was _END_ASM, we will now shift to _NO_ASM state.
If previous line was a blank line, assume that the headers are intentionally sorted the way they are.
If previous section is different from current section, _last_header will be reset to empty string, so it's always less than current header.
If protocol is None, the URLs in the sitemap will use the protocol with which the sitemap was requested.
If psycopg is installed but not geos, the import path hits django.contrib.gis.geometry.backend which will "helpfully" convert an ImportError into an ImproperlyConfigured.
If rc is 0, set running as appropriate
If registration is required for accessing this page, and the user isn't logged in, redirect to the login page.
If related object has a natural key, use it
If remote_field is None, we're ordering with respect to a GenericForeignKey and don't know what the foreign class is - we'll add those accessors later in contribute_to_class().
If rhs is some QuerySet, don't touch it
If rolling back to a savepoint fails, mark for rollback at a higher level and avoid shadowing the original exception.
If saving to the same database, and this model is deferred, then automatically do a "update_fields" save on the loaded fields.
If self._choices is set, then somebody must have manually set the property self.choices.
If self.actions is explicitly set to None that means that we don't want *any* actions enabled on this page.
If self.bmp_data contains identical data blocks, keep the first one, remove duplicates and change the indexes in self.bmp_lookup to point to the first one.
If selinux fails to find a default, return an array of None
If so we might be able to reuse the already loaded value.
If so, add the module to the model_list.
If so, use that, otherwise try to resolve name to address using system's resolver.
If so, we can take a shortcut here and simply prepend them to those attached to each block (if any)
If so, we move into the always portion of the block, otherwise we get the next task from the list.
If so, we will clean those up in connect, disconnect and _live_receivers while holding self.lock.
If so, we will only send this task to the first host in the list.
If some work, check chroot.py to see how to disable just some methods.
If someone has marked an add form for deletion, don't save the object.
If someone tries to create an hstore field it will error there.
If source is a directory populate our list else source is a file and translate it to a tuple.
If source was defined as content remove the temporary file and fail out.
If specified header doesn't exist then remove any existing authenticated remote-user, or return (leaving request.user set to AnonymousUser by the AuthenticationMiddleware).
If ssh breaks we could leave tmp directories out on the remote system.
If swappable is True, then see if we're actually pointing to the target of a swap.
If target_arch is not specified, then only install for the host architecture.
If tblib isn't installed, pickling the traceback will always fail.
If template_name isn't specified, it's not a problem -- we just start with an empty list.
If tests are invoke with "-Wall" (or any -W flag actually) then warning logging gets disabled (see configure_logging in django/utils/log.py).
If that doesn't update anything, do an INSERT.
If that fails we bail out.
If that happens, then also add having expressions to group by.
If that is not found, we resort to the simple name field, which doesn't have anything extra added to it.
If that template is not available, we should ignore the error in favor of re-raising the underlying exception that caused the 500 error.
If that's why, make it writable and try the op again.
If the "id" attribute is specified in the Form and auto_id is True, the "id" attribute in the Form gets precedence.
If the #include is found in a public include directory, that header is expanded into the amalgamation header.
If the DB can group by primary key, then group by the primary key of query's main model.
If the Exception is CommandError and --traceback is not present this command should raise a SystemExit and don't print any traceback to the stderr.
If the Exception is CommandError and --traceback is present this command should raise the original CommandError as if it were not a CommandError.
If the GUID contains lowercase hex letters, MSVS will be fine.
If the GeometryField SRID is -1, then we shouldn't perform any transformation if the SRID of the input geometry is different.
If the I/O object does not exist yet it will be initialized.
If the IS NOT NULL check is removed then outercol NOT IN will return UNKNOWN.
If the IS NULL check is removed, then if outercol IS NULL we will not match the row.
If the JOIN used in aggregation doesn't have content type as part of the condition the annotation will also count the 'hi mom' tag for b.
If the Layer supports random reading, return.
If the NXCOMPAT flag has not been specified, default to on.
If the PostGIS types reverse dictionary is not populated, do so now.
If the User model has been swapped out, we can't make any assumptions about the default user name.
If the `geo_field_type` keyword was used, then enforce that type limitation.
If the action is a callable, just use it.
If the action plugin directly invokes the module (instead of going through a strategy) then we don't have a cross-process Lock specifically for this module.
If the active build configuration is changed, the project file must be closed and reopened if it is desired for the tree view to update.
If the annotation precedes the values clause, it won't be included unless it is explicitly named
If the app already exists, we add a dependency on the last migration, as we don't know which migration contains the target field.
If the app just doesn't have the module in question, we can ignore the error attempting to import it, otherwise we want it to bubble up.
If the app registry is not ready, reverse fields are unavailable, therefore we throw a FieldDoesNotExist exception.
If the application didn't restore the original autocommit setting, don't take chances, drop the connection.
If the appropriate environment variables are set, they override other configuration
If the argument starts with a slash or dash, it's probably a command line switch
If the attribute is a list, just take the first element.
If the attribute was a property sheet attributes, we remove it, since they are useless.
If the backend does not support transactions, we should reload class data before each test
If the backend hasn't been used, no more retrieval is necessary.
If the backend is Oracle, test that the client encoding is set correctly.
If the backend is Oracle, test that we can call a standard stored procedure through our cursor wrapper.
If the backend is Oracle, test that we can pass cursor variables as query parameters.
If the backend is Oracle, test that we can save a text longer than 4000 chars and read it properly
If the backend needs to force an ordering we make sure it's the only "ORDER BY" clause present in the query.
If the backwards relation is disabled, replace the original related_name with one generated from the m2m field name.
If the base address is not specifically controlled, DYNAMICBASE should be on by default.
If the caller didn't provide a path, there can be either multiple paths (PBXVariantGroup) or one.
If the caller is prepared to handle them, all is well.
If the child is a filter, we want to append all its children to this same list.
If the chunk received by the handler is None, then don't continue.
If the closing parenthesis is preceded by only whitespaces, try to give a more descriptive error message.
If the command already has path elements (either relative or absolute), then assume it is constructed properly.
If the command is already loaded, use it directly.
If the common names don't match, we restart.
If the current locale can't encode the data, we let the user input the password manually.
If the database can't use chunked reads we need to make sure we evaluate the entire query up front.
If the database files for the GeoLite country and/or city datasets exist, then try and open them.
If the database files for the GeoLite country and/or city datasets exist, then try to open them.
If the database is marked as a test mirror, save the alias.
If the database offers no KML method, we use the `kml` attribute of the lazy geometry instead.
If the database returns a Decimal, convert it to a float as expected by the Python geometric objects.
If the db_table wasn't provided, use the app_label + model_name.
If the default manager is used, only the public one will be deleted.
If the default template doesn't exist, use the string template.
If the dependencies list is empty, it's not needed, so unhook it.
If the destination file exists and allow_overwrite is False then raise an IOError
If the directory is relative to the documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.
If the effective connector is OR and this node contains an aggregate, then we need to push the whole branch to HAVING clause.
If the exception handler returns a TemplateResponse that has not been rendered, force it to be rendered.
If the expression didn't yield anything then it's likely a class.
If the field doesn't install a backward relation on the target model (so `is_hidden` returns True), then there are no clashes to check and we can skip these fields.
If the field has a relation, there should be only one of the 4 cardinality flags available.
If the field is a primary key, then doing a query against the field's model is ok, too.
If the field is a relatedfield with an unresolved rel.to, just set it equal to the other field side.
If the field is named as a radio_field, use a RadioSelect
If the field is nullable, allowing the save() would result in silent data loss.
If the field is required, clearing is not possible (the widget shouldn't return False data in that case anyway).
If the field specifies choices, we don't need to look for special admin widgets - we just need to use a select widget of some kind.
If the file came from the mac_bundle_resources list or if the rule is marked to process outputs as bundle resource, do so.
If the file exists, delete it from the filesystem.
If the file has an encoding, encode unicode with it.
If the file has the wrong C++ extension, then we add a rule to copy that to intermediates and use the new version.
If the file itself is a symlink, always resolve it.
If the filename already exists, add an underscore and a random 7 character alphanumeric string (before the file extension, if one exists) to the filename until the generated filename doesn't exist.
If the form is permitted to be empty, and none of the form data has changed from the initial data, short circuit any validation.
If the form's valid we can handle the action.
If the framework doesn't contain a binary, then nothing depends on the actions -- make the framework depend on them directly too.
If the from-key has          ...the to-list will have this action this character appended:...
If the geom parameter srid is None, it is assumed the coordinates are in the transformed units.
If the given URL is "Not Found", then check if we should redirect to a path with a slash appended.
If the given field does not have help text, nothing will be output.
If the group by is set to a list (by .values() call most likely), then we need to add everything in it to the GROUP BY clause.
If the groups aren't in the listed order, do a name comparison.
If the hidden object wasn't seen during the save process, there would now be two objects in the database.
If the include already had tags specified, we raise an error so that users know not to specify them both ways
If the index name is too long, truncate it
If the initial value was not added by the browser, the geometry provided may be slightly different, the first time it is saved.
If the inner loop found something, break without advancing to another build file.
If the inner query uses default select and it has some aggregate annotations, then we must make sure the inner query is grouped by the main model's primary key.
If the item is undefined then we want to fall through to the next value rather than failing.
If the join to a__ returns nothing, the ANDed filter for a__f2 can't be true.
If the key already exists, then it must be a dummy node.
If the key isn't regex-able, just return as-is.
If the last line ended in a newline, the list comprehension will have an extra entry that's just a newline.
If the left side of the join was already relabeled, use the updated alias.
If the line is empty or consists of entirely a comment, no need to check it.
If the line's pattern doesn't fall into the above categories.
If the list contains any descendant dicts, path fixing will occur.
If the list is a queryset, we'll invent a template name based on the app and model name.
If the log entry doesn't have a content type it should still be possible to view the Recent Actions part (#10275).
If the login url is the same scheme and net location then just use the path as the "next" url.
If the lookup parameters aren't real fields, then bail out.
If the manager is marked "use_for_related_fields", it'll get used instead of the "bare" queryset.
If the migration is already applied, do backwards mode, otherwise do forwards mode.
If the migration is unknown, skip it.
If the model is a proxy, ensure that the base class hasn't been swapped out.
If the model is already loaded, pass it to the function immediately.
If the module takes both, bad things could happen.
If the name attribute seems unnecessary now, get rid of it.
If the name is all caps and underscores, figure it's a macro and ignore it, unless it's TEST or TEST_F.
If the nodata flag is True, set the nodata value.
If the object actually defines a domain, we're done.
If the objects in the m2m have a natural key, use it
If the original parent didn't have a name but the child did, let the child's name live on.
If the original parent had a name set, keep using it.
If the output path has variables in it, which happens in practice for 'copies', writing the environment as target-local doesn't work, because the variables are already needed for the target name.
If the output stream doesn't have a fileno, it's virtual
If the page is only for videos or for a game
If the pixeltype is an integer, convert to int
If the pk is None, it means that the object can't be deleted again.
If the pointer is NULL, throw an exception.
If the precompiled header is generated by a C source, we must not try to use it for C++ sources, and vice versa.
If the previous file has been deleted, the file name can be reused
If the previous read in text mode failed, try binary mode.
If the process has not yet exited, but we've already read EOF from its stdout and stderr (and thus removed both from rpipes), we can just wait for it to exit.
If the property doesn't exist yet, create a new empty list to receive the item.
If the provided user is not authenticated, or no user was provided, filter the list to only public flatpages.
If the query is used as a subquery for a ForeignKey with non-pk target field, make sure to select the target field in the subquery.
If the query used inner joins, then the join to fk_rel would remove o from the results.
If the queryset isn't already ordered we need to add an artificial ordering here to make sure that all formsets constructed from this queryset have the same form order.
If the raster argument is set to BILATERAL, then the operator cannot handle mixed geom-raster lookups.
If the related field isn't cached, then an instance hasn't been assigned and there's no need to worry about this check.
If the related manager indicates that it should be used for related fields, respect that.
If the remote model does not have a default ordering, we order by its 'id' field.
If the request was POSTed, this might be a bulk action or a bulk edit.
If the resource lives in a .lproj bundle, add that to the destination.
If the response supports deferred rendering and hasn't been rendered yet, then ensure that it does get rendered before proceeding further.
If the response supports deferred rendering, apply template response middleware and then render the response
If the result is a measure object, get value.
If the result of this function needs to be converted.
If the reverse_cache_name is set, then we also set the reverse link.
If the router doesn't have a method, skip to the next one.
If the same template name appears twice, raise an exception to avoid system recursion.
If the schema indicates that "name" is required, try to access the property even if it doesn't exist.
If the setting name has the _excluded suffix, then check the root name.
If the string already contains a "*/", it is turned into "(*)/".
If the string is not a complete xml document, we may need to add a root element.
If the subquery explicitly uses a different database, an error should be raised.
If the table's there, that's fine - we've never changed its schema in the codebase.
If the target and include share some initial basename component, it's possible the target is implementing the include, so it's allowed to be first, but we'll never complain if it's not there.
If the target file and the include we're checking share a basename when we drop common extensions, and the include lives in .
If the target is (app_label, None), that means unmigrate everything
If the test class is either browser-specific or a test base, return it.
If the token is in the query of the original url we have to manually add it
If the traceback for current exception is consumed, try the other exception.
If the two objects are of the same sort rank, compare their names.
If the units are known, convert value into area measure.
If the user contradicts themselves (uploads a new file AND checks the "clear" checkbox), we return a unique marker object that FileField will turn into a ValidationError.
If the user is already authenticated and that user is the user we are getting passed in the headers, then the correct user is already persisted in the session and we don't need to continue.
If the value 'ansible_delegated_vars' is in the variables, it means we have a delegated-to host, so we check there first before looking at the variables in general
If the value for the field doesn't correspond to a valid choice, the value itself is provided as a display value.
If the value is provided using a default, then we fall back to system defaults.
If the value is the same all configurations, just add one unconditional entry.
If the variable is already set, don't set it.
If the view raises an exception, Django will attempt to show the 500.html template.
If the websocket was terminated and there are no messages left in the queue, return None immediately otherwise the client will block forever
If the widget got contradictory inputs, we raise a validation error
If the_dict's parent is not a dict (it could be a list or it could be parentless because it is a root dict), the_dict_key will be None.
If there are 'natural' subelements, it must be a natural key
If there are *any* named groups, ignore all non-named groups.
If there are 10 or fewer pages, display links to every page.
If there are 5 or 6 bits, there is a user defined
If there are any named groups, use those as kwargs, ignoring non-named groups.
If there are any object files in our input file list, link them into our output.
If there are field name clashes, hide consequent column name clashes.
If there are multiple loop variables, unpack the item into them.
If there are n source files matching the rule, and m additional rule inputs, then adding 'inputs' to each build edge written below will write m * n inputs.
If there are no colors specified, return the empty palette.
If there are no hosts to select from, just return the empty set.
If there are no upload handlers defined, initialize them from settings.
If there are no versions in the list, we'll grab the head of the master branch
If there are parameters, add them
If there aren't any objects, there is nothing to do.
If there aren't any rows in the output, just append the hidden fields.
If there is a ::, we need to expand it with zeroes to get to 8 hextets - unless there is a dot in the last hextet, meaning we're doing v4-mapping
If there is a filter and the target does not match, exclude the target.
If there is a parent 'src' or 'java' folder, navigate up to it - these are canonical package root names in Chromium.
If there is a platform with more than one package manager, put the preferred one last.
If there is a reason for either of those to differ, then this mapping can be overridden after an instance of this class is created.
If there is a values() clause, Extra
If there is an ansible module, use that as the value for the 'name' key.
If there is any hinting information, add it to what we already know.
If there is just one column in the index, use a default algorithm from Django
If there is just one part left, try first get_lookup() so that if the lhs supports both transform and lookup for the name, then lookup will be picked.
If there is no metadata, the default behavior is to not allow duplicates, if there is metadata, check to see if the allow_duplicates flag was set to true
If there is no slicing in use, then we can safely drop all ordering
If there isn't a CSRF_COOKIE_DOMAIN, assume we need an exact match on host:port.
If there wasn't an extra newline by itself, then the file being emulated doesn't have a newline to end the last line  remove the newline that our naive format() added
If there were ModelAdmins registered, we should have a list of app labels for which we need to allow access to the app_index view,
If there's EWKT, set the SRS w/value of the SRID.
If there's a .svn file in the current directory, we recursively look up the directory tree for the top of the SVN checkout
If there's a replaces, make a string for it
If there's already a max-age header but we're being asked to set a new max-age, use the minimum of the two ages.
If there's an even number of bits, there's no prefix
If there's anything left unvisited, there must be a circular dependency (cycle).
If there's changes that aren't in migrations yet, tell them how to fix it.
If there's no entry for the current thread (which is the only one we ever access), it is assumed to be empty.
If there's no path, then there's no need for us to do work
If there's only one TestCase, parallelization isn't needed.
If there's only one node for this file, simplify the display by making it a box without an internal node.
If there's some other error, this must be an error in Django
If these are present, then we check the second character instead.
If they generate any extra headers etc., the per-.o file dep tracking will catch the proper rebuilds, so order only is still ok here.
If they still want to merge it, then write out an empty file depending on the migrations needing merging.
If they supplied command line arguments, work out what they mean.
If they want to make an empty migration, make one for each app
If they want to merge and there is something to merge, then divert into the merge code
If they want to merge and there's nothing to merge, then politely exit
If they're present, Xcode will provide a slight optimization by only running the script phase if any output is missing or outdated relative to any input.
If this becomes generally needed, change the signature to operate on a variable number of arguments instead.
If this block's parent doesn't have an extends node it is the root, and its block nodes also need to be added to the block context.
If this difference doesn't exist, the cookie time will be 1 second larger.
If this doesn't "feel" like a URL, re-raise.
If this doesn't crash, it's a Good Thing.
If this entry has been visited, nothing to do.
If this function depends on more than one model, we recursively turn it into a chain of functions that accept a single model argument and pass each in turn to lazy_model_operation.
If this happens, reset the session.
If this is a callable, do not invoke it here.
If this is a callable, re-raise.
If this is a folder, check its entries too.
If this is a model with an order_with_respect_to autopopulate the _order field
If this is a natural foreign key to an object that has a FK/O2O as the foreign key, use the FK value
If this is a one-to-one relation, set the reverse accessor cache on the related object to the current instance to avoid an extra SQL query if it's accessed later on.

If this works, the app module specifies an app config class.
If ticket #1578 ever slips back in, these models will not be able to be created (the field names being lower-cased versions of their opposite classes is important here).
If toplevel-dir is not set, we assume that depth is the root of our source tree.
If transactions aren't available, Django will serialize the database contents into a fixture during setup and flush and reload them during teardown (as flush does not restore data from migrations).

If we delete data that was pre-filled, we should get an error.
If we detected a type split across two lines, join the previous line to current line so that we can match const references accordingly.
If we didn't find the end of the class, last_line would be zero, and the check will be skipped by the first condition.

If we download foo.mp3 and convert it to...
If we execute the exact same statement, it won't create a Person.
If we fill a form with something and then we check the can_delete checkbox for that form, that form's errors should not make the entire formset invalid since it's going to be deleted.

If you specify a different suffix, it will be appended regardless of the last character of the label.
If you try to raw_save a parent attribute onto a child object, the attribute will be ignored.
If you try to save a model created with such a form, you need to ensure that the fields that are _not_ on the form have default values, or are allowed to have a value of None.
If you use 'select' with extra() and names containing dashes on a query that's *not* a values() query, those extra 'select' values will silently be ignored.
If you use ansible's API instead of re-raising an exception, use to_unicode instead:
If you want cleaning an empty value to return a different type, tell the field
If you want the validation message to be associated with a particular field, implement the clean_XXX() method on the Form, where XXX is the field name.
If you want to expire an object on January 1st of next year, this is how you do that."
If you're not careful, it's possible to introduce infinite loops via default ordering on foreign keys in a cycle.

In order to preserve compatibility with Python 3.2 unicode literals prefix shouldn't be added to strings.
In order to put something at the front of the list, you'd need to set it's order to 0.
In order to work around this, we decided to generate the configuration for twice, one is to generate "Debug" config, the other one to generate the "Release" config.
In other words, you can't free the memory allocated inside GEOS.
In our usage we should only receive unicode strings.
In particular, for concrete models, the concrete_model is always the class itself.
In practice this happens when a decorator and a piece of middleware both operate on a given view.
In practice, migrations don't care about the app name, but we need something unique, and the label works fine.

In ps, 'comm' means the base command and 'command' is the full command.
In py2, it's a byte string like in C.
In py3 it's an abstract text type (like py2's unicode type).
In python 2 response HTTP headers are bytestrings
In range-based for, we wanted spaces before and after the colon, but not around "::" tokens that might appear.
In reality we handle this with the Python tokenizer, which avoids mis-detections due to nesting, comments and strings.
In some cases caption is null, which corresponds to None in python.
In some cases, Django would pick the wrong join type for the second relation, resulting in missing objects in the queryset.

In the case of a concrete field with relation, includes the *_id name too
In the case of a loop, the delegated_to host may have been templated based on the loop variable, so we try and locate the host name in the delegated variable dictionary here
In the case of identical date values, these methods will use the ID as a fallback check.
In the first case, we don't want to update the dimension fields because we are already getting their values from the database.
In the following test, each condition is a check and logical comparison (or or and) that sets the rc value.
In the future we could optimize more types: * lists can be squashed together * dicts could squash entries that match in all cases except the name or pkg field.
In the future we should probably generalize this even further (mapping of param: squash field)
In the future, maybe it should just accept a list, and not the whole data dict.
In the latter case, we want to package just the API exposed by the outermost module.
In the meantime we take this practical approach to solve a regression on 1.6 when the reverse manager in hidden (related_name ends with a '+').
In the moment there is no way to add extra data to a Geomtry in Three.js.
In the past, no systematic rules were enforced about inventory hostnames, but the parsing context (e.g. shlex.split(), fnmatch.fnmatch()) excluded various metacharacters anyway.
In the same transaction on the main connection, perform a queryset delete that covers the object deleted with the other connection.
In the same way, a do/while should never be on one line
In the second case, we do want to update the dimensions fields and will skip this return because force will be True since we were called from ImageFileDescriptor.__set__.
In this case give back a plain field instance.
In this case there is no need adding specific models to the list.
In this case we are actually (ab)using them to do logical combination so it's consistent with other usage in Django.
In this case we don't want to accidentally change the type of the variable to a string by using the jinja template renderer.
In this case we return early on non-linux platforms.
In this case we simply don't perform the checks defined below.
In this case, it's up to you to call save() on the resulting model instance.
In this case, just return self._choices.
In this case, we also need to save the compile_deps for the target, so that the the target that directly depends on the .objs can also depend on those.
In this case, you can implement db_type() instead of get_internal_type() to specify exactly which wacky database column type you want to use.
In this example, auto_id is False, but the "id" attribute for the "first_name" field is given.
In this example, grandparent would be set to path/to and parent_root would be set to Language.
In this example, the data dictionary doesn't include a value for the "nick_name" field, but cleaned_data includes it.
In this example, the data doesn't have a prefix, but the form requires it, so the form doesn't "see" the fields.
In this example, we don't provide a value for 'username', and the form raises a validation error rather than using the initial value for 'username'.
In this example, we pass a bunch of extra fields to the form constructor, but cleaned_data contains only the form's fields.
In this implementation we replace the password with 8 "*" which is also the length of our password.
In this video, music URLs (anti.s) are blocked outside China and USA, while the MV URL (mvurl) is available globally, so force the MV URL for consistent results in different countries
In this way we avoid calling the cached property.
In those cases, content_type will be None.
In.process_rhs() expects values to be hashable, so convert lists to tuples.
Incidentally, they have names denoting which part of the client made the request.
Include a dummy out folder so that Eclipse doesn't use the default /bin folder in the root of the project.
Include a reference to the real function (used to check original arguments by the template parser, and to bear the 'is_safe' attribute when multiple decorators are applied).
Include both possible locations.
Include dirs will occasionally use the SHARED_INTERMEDIATE_DIR variable as part of the path when dealing with generated headers.
Include extra plist items that are per-target, not per global XcodeSettings.
Include kwargs if they're not the default values.
Include syntax errors
Include template information.
Include the inputs from any actions.
Include the model itself
Include the optional message
Include the standard JRE container and a dummy out folder
Include them here for completeness, as they are very likely to have the same usage pattern.

Including comma in chars
Including special chars in both path and chars Special characters in path
Including the input file as an argument causes index.parse() to fail.
Including unicode in chars

Instead it goes through the shell that zlogin selects.
Instead just save them up...
Instead of appending to lhs one character at a time, we do another regular expression match to consume several characters at once if possible.
Instead of sorting alphabetically, sort things in the order of the targets that produce the products.
Instead of throwing out 64 bits of the digest, xor them into the portion that gets used.
Instead of using assert() which will crash debugger log an error message and tolerate this non-fatal situation.
Instead of using the MANIFESTUAC flags, we generate a .manifest to include into the list of manifests.
Instead we don't worry about limit if only implicit localhost was in inventory to start with.
Instead we run it on the machine rsync is connecting to.
Instead, clear all caches when we're finished updating the model instances.
Instead, get the content type ID here, and later when the actual instance is needed, use ContentType.objects.get_for_id(), which has a global cache.
Instead, it favors the use of find_library and passing absolute paths to target_link_libraries.
Instead, just return the ContentType object and let the app detect stale states.
Instead, the message is just marked for escaping by the template engine.
Instead, we just count the number of results).
Instead, we merge all the manifests provided (along with one that includes what would normally be in the linker-generated one, see msvs_emulation.py), and include that into the first and only link.
Instruct the parser to create a detailed processing record containing metadata not normally retained.

Intentionally no assert
Intentionally not a string (Refs #19318)
Intentionally not in alphabetical order to check if the order is preserved.
Intermediate objects like Play() won't have their fields validated by default, as their values are often inherited by other objects and validated later, so we don't want them to fail out early
IntermediatesGroup is used to collect source-like files that are generated by rules or script phases and are placed in intermediate directories such as DerivedSources.

Invoke the translation function.
Is 'args' empty, then this is the default prompted pause
Issue #17980: avoid denials of service by refusing more than one wildcard per fragment.
Issue warning if the line before public/protected/private was not a blank line, but don't do this if the previous line contains "class" or "struct".
It allows makemigrations to declare dependencies on apps before they even have migrations.
It allows us to truncate tables referenced by a foreign key in any other table.
It also downloads the videos
It also handles drive letters differently than the pure Python implementation, so it's best not to replace it.
It also requires a fairly recent libtool, and if the system clang isn't used, DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH needs to contain the path to the libLTO.dylib that matches the used clang.
It also should not create INNER JOIN.
It also uses the arte_vp_url url from the webpage to extract the information
It can also be pre-cached by the forward accessor (ForwardManyToOneDescriptor).
It can also be pre-cached by the reverse accessor (ReverseOneToOneDescriptor).
It can be run with either Python 2 or 3.
It can be used for documentation purposes, though.
It can display more, but we'll look at how to do so later.
It can happen only if the state checker accepts a state that isn't handled above.
It can't be ever restricted to a smaller set, but additional columns in HAVING, ORDER BY, and SELECT clauses are added to it.
It can't start with a number on Oracle, so prepend D if we need to
It checks consistency in case of unsafe crashes in RocksDB.
It comes after the creation of CSRF cookies, so that everything else continues to work exactly the same (e.g. cookies are sent, etc.), but before any branches that call reject().
It comes out as a string of space-separated integers.
It contains line breaks.
It crashed after the Field.get_db_prep_* refactor, because on most backends DateTimeFields supports usecs, but DateTimeField.to_python didn't recognize them.
It defaults to the language option or en if the language is not set.
It defaults to the project name.
It depends on the copy target.
It disables certificate verification *globally*.
It does make sense for custom fields though, for example an enumfield that takes the enum class as an argument.
It does, however, keep a name.
It doesn't matter which answer we use to check the order, it will always be the same.
It doesn't respect the 'Range' header, it would download the whole video caused the travis builds to fail: https://travis-ci.org/rg3/youtube-dl/jobs/14493845#L59
It follows the same pattern as the clean hook on Forms.
It gets emptied out every time the script is run
It gets used when an action plugin directly invokes a module instead of going through the strategies.
It has changed, write it
It has to be run inside the django git root directory.
It includes each non_runtest_target that does not have suppress_wildcard set.
It is False by default so overriding self.clean() and failing to call super will stop validate_unique from being called.
It is allowed to filter on values that would be found from local model anyways.
It is also provided as a convenience to those who want to deploy these URLs elsewhere.
It is based on make.py, the standard makefile generator.
It is composed of a list of fields pointing to the current model from other models.
It is defined below because it uses PBXContainerItemProxy, defined below.
It is in the mobile version, but that seems to use a different URL structure altogether.
It is marked as outer join by above filter (even if it is trimmed away).
It is merged with a list that can come from the generator to create non_configuration_keys.
It is no longer incredibly sucky, but this list needs to be extended.
It is not displayed when a Form is rendered with any data (including an empty dictionary).
It is not sufficient to just rely on Name() to get the XCFileLikeElement's name, because that is not a complete pathname.
It is not sufficient to just rely on name and parent to build a unique hashable : a node could have two child PBXGroup sharing a common name.
It is not the way ansible generally invokes the module so it won't work in every case.
It is only applied once, regardless of the number of times it appears in a chain (to be changed in Django 2.0).
It is only guaranteed to exist and be constant within the context of a project, corresponding to a single input file.
It is possible to order by reverse of foreign key, although that can lead to duplicate results.
It is possible to reuse U for the second subquery, no need to use W.
It is preserved because it is used by the oracle backend (django.db.backends.oracle.query), and also for backwards-compatibility with any external code which may have used this method.
It is retained here for backwards compatibility purposes.
It is something, so let's try and build a CIDR from the parts
It is specific to each build environment.
It is the same as the python3 stdlib mock library
It is very heavily advised to keep each target in an entire project (even across multiple project files) using the same set of configuration names.
It is weird that GET and SCAN raise exception for non-existent key, while delete does not
It isn't part of a playlist
It just means that it's going to load a build file that contains targets and is expected to provide a targets dict that contains the targets...
It just removes the monitor so that we can kill them on upgrade.
It knows how to validate a set of data and it knows how to render itself in a couple of default ways (e.g., an HTML table).
It looks like the keys are the arguments that have to be passed as the hd field in the request url, we pick the higher Also, filter non-number qualities (see issue #3643).
It may also be an object with an urlpatterns attribute or urlpatterns itself.
It may be used at some point in the future or we may just have the put/fetch operations not send back a final response at all
It may happen that the object is deleted from the DB right after this check, causing the subsequent UPDATE to return zero matching rows.
It may make sense to generate some .mk files on the side to keep the the files readable.
It may probably better to solve this by checking Content-Type for application/octet-stream after HEAD request finishes, but not sure if we can rely on this.
It might be a view, then no results will be returned
It might make sense to render each form as a table row with each field as a td.
It might not actually have a column behind it
It mustn't call get_app_config().
It needs every file separate, not a string else ./run barfs
It needs to be reloaded on access, so one query executed.
It requires ffmpeg (m3u8 download)
It seems assets always go from lower to better quality, so no need to sort
It seems it is possible that self is not in all_models, so guard against that with default for get().
It seems there's a race between the creation of the .pdb by the precompiled header step for .cc and the compilation of .c files.
It should NOT be unicode.
It should allow all existing related objects/inlines for a given object to be displayed, but not allow the creation of new inlines beyond max_num.
It should be added to extra.
It should be possible for Oracle as well, but the semantics for  extracting the primary keys is trickier so it's not done yet.
It should be possible to compare *_lazy objects.
It should have one dependency, the parent xcode target.
It shouldn't start with an underscore (Oracle hates this)
It simply ignores a limit and returns the whole offset number of videos.
It supports https if key_file and cert_file are given.
It takes into account quoted quotes, and makes sure that the quotes match.
It tells us what we have to look to substitute in the module files and whether we're using module replacer or ziploader to format the module itself.
It turns out that modern OpenStack auth is WAY more complex than this.
It uses its own database connection.
It uses the lower-cased object_name + "_set", but this can be overridden with the "related_name" option.
It was introduced in Python 2.5 and already deprecated in Python 2.6.
It will (essentially) increment the extra argument
It will get a default common name like user.nuclide.host
It will get re-populated in the cloned queryset the next time it's used.
It will only be called by re.sub with match.group(0) containing a character matched by the the _escaped expression.
It will raise an exception if not valid.
It will try to save the deleted session which will cause an UpdateError that's caught and results in a redirect to the original page.
It won't be for deeper levels.
It won't be guaranteed to be correct until contribute_to_class is called.
It won't have an opened file.
It would be nice (but not too important) to skip the middle join in this case.
It would be nice to be able to handle this, but the queries don't really make sense (or return consistent value sets).
It would seem obvious to call these next two members 'template' and 'context', but those names are reserved as part of the test Client API.
It'll blow up if the args aren't immutable, among other "problems".
It's a side-effect of using constants here and not a real concern.
It's a tradeoff between allowing reasonable code and avoiding trying to parse more C++ using regexps.
It's actually a link to a flv file
It's an IPv6 address without a port.
It's an actual non-HTML word or char
It's an application with migrations disabled.
It's an error for a target to depend on all other targets in the same file, because a target cannot depend on itself.
It's an error for a user to have add permission but NOT change permission for users.
It's best when the caller provides the path.
It's called `settings_dict` instead of `settings` to disambiguate it from Django settings modules.
It's called self._request because self.request gets overwritten by django.test.client.Client.
It's case-insensitive
It's defined in the base class to minimize code duplication.
It's defined to be 255 bytes or less, but this includes one byte for the length of the name and one byte for the trailing dot that's used to indicate absolute names in DNS.
It's different from None.
It's enough that the form saves without error -- the custom save routine will generate an AssertionError if it is called more than once during save.
It's especially a problem on Windows.
It's going to be created below if needed.
It's handled in LoadTargetBuildFileCallback.
It's hard to tell, though, so we punt on this one for now.
It's hard to test for constant time, just test the result.
It's important to get the "All" target first, though.
It's in the SUNWPython-devel package which also contains development files that don't belong on production boxes.
It's just a collection of functions.
It's necessary to preserve the historical behavior of request_finished.
It's neither necessary nor appropriate to use django.utils.encoding.smart_text for parsing URLs and form inputs.
It's not a section, so the current state tells us what kind of definition it must be.
It's not a valid IPv4 CIDR
It's not a valid IPv6 CIDR.
It's not actually a unique constraint.
It's not numerical CIDR, give up
It's not possible for gmock macros to appear in the first 2 lines, since the class head + section name takes up 2 lines.
It's not rocket science.
It's not worth attempting to compress really short responses.
It's ok not to have spaces around binary operators like + - * /, but if there's too little whitespace, we get concerned.
It's ok to have many commands in a switch case that fits in 1 line
It's only used for debugging on the remote machine.
It's possible one outputs on stderr and the other on stdout, hence the set
It's possible to associate the errors to particular field with the Form.add_error() method or by passing a dictionary that maps each field to one or more errors.
It's possible to construct a Form dynamically by adding to the self.fields dictionary in __init__().
It's possible to get to the value which would be used for rendering the widget for a field by using the BoundField's value method.
It's possible to have the unique and PK constraints in separate indexes.
It's possible to use 64-bit kernel with 32-bit userland, e.g. to give linker slightly more memory.
It's possible to use values() calls across many-to-one relations.
It's preferable to keep dependencies listed first during a link phase so that they can override symbols that would otherwise be provided by libraries, which will usually include system libraries.
It's probably a playlist
It's selected when winrm is the connection
It's something like generic foreign key.
It's still using the changelist ordering from before User2's edits in step 2.
It's stupid to replace and append simultaneously, for example.
It's sufficient that this query runs without error.
It's used for recording which joins exist in the query and what types they are.
It's very probable that the token is missing because of misconfiguration, so we raise a warning
It's worth testing that parameters are quoted.
Item normally requires a join with Note to do the default ordering, but that isn't needed here.
Items for which no exclusion or inclusion has been applied (yet) have value -1, items excluded have value 0, and items included have value 1.
Iterable natural keys are rolled out as subelements

JavaScript construction utilities for the Bounds and Projection.
JavaScript is weakly typed for these, so it makes sense to also allow them.
Join promotion note - we must not remove any rows here, so if there is no existing joins, use outer join.
Join the constructed URL with the provided location, which will allow the provided ``location`` to apply query strings to the base path as well as override the host, if it begins with //
Join the two lists and combine it with default values
Join type of 'alias' changed, so re-examine all aliases that refer to this one.
Just as when using a get() lookup, you will get an error if more than one object is returned.
Just check we can create it

Just pass a Form instance to the template, and use "dot" access to refer to individual fields.
Just pass it in the defaults for when the form class will later be instantiated.
Just return SQL at this point
Just set max_age - the max_age logic will set expires.

KeyError will be raised by os.getpwuid() (called by getuser()) if there is no corresponding entry in the /etc/passwd file (a very restricted chroot environment, for example).
Keyed by name, to provide multiple named local memory caches.
Keys are names of packages and values are the corresponding configs.
Keys could be made bytes later if the code that gets the data is more naturally byte-oriented
Keys that do not belong inside a configuration dictionary.
Keys with these suffixes should be treated the same as keys without.

No-op if not in debug mode or an non-local prefix
No-op, used by tests') Since this target depends on binary and resources which are in nested subfolders, the framework directory will be older than its dependencies usually.
Nodes in in_degree_zeros have no dependencies not in flat_list, so they can be appended to flat_list.
Non Fallback: Decide to use native source (e.g. youtube or vimeo) or the own CDN

Normal geodetic distance lookup (uses `distance_sphere` on PostGIS.
Normal metacafe video
Normal setUpClass() methods won't have exception handling so this method wouldn't typically be run.

Normalize everything to tuples
Normalize paths everywhere.
Normalize plain strings to instances of ValidationError.
Normalize the node, and remove all extranous whitespaces.
Normalize the path so trailing slashes don't confuse us.
Normalize to ValidationError and let its constructor do the hard work of making sense of the input.
Normalize to strings.
Normally make does this implicitly, but we force rules to always run so we can check their command lines.
Normally the xcode-ninja generator includes only valid executable targets.
Not a followed redirect
Not a git repository collect git status information
Not a substitute for good Web security programming practices.
Not all GIS backends have geometry columns model
Not all generators will need to use the rule_sources lists, but some may, and it seems best to build the list in a common spot.
Not all pages define this value
Not all rax modules support this.
Not all the annotations have TEXT children and the annotations are returned unsorted.
Not amazingly nice to force the path like this, but should be harmless.
Not by any means perfect, but good enough for our purposes.
Not checking MD5 as sometimes the direct HTTP link results in 404 and HLS is used
Not enough OR Too many

Not used, but required by AppConfig.__init__
Not using urlparse here as it does not handle unknown schemes well.
Not usually a good idea to pass in a datetime here (it loses information), but this can be a side-effect of interacting with a database backend (e.g. Oracle), so we'll be accommodating.
Not very inspired, but it's what Xcode uses.
Not worth the extra complexity when you can write a real query instead.
Not-necessarily-technical managers of the site.
Note - 0 here would be a nicer result...
Note -- if we have a global function to setup, that would be a better place to run this
Note -- this is a Mapping, not a MutableMapping
Note on Dependencies and Libraries: CMake wants to handle link order, resolving the link line up front.
Note that .tlb is not included in the outputs as it is not always generated depending on the content of the input idl file.
Note that Adrian's age is 34 in the fixtures, and he has one book so both conditions match one author.
Note that Python sort is stable.
Note that STATIC_URL cannot be empty.
Note that Windows is not affected and produces playable files (see https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/issues/8300).
Note that both fields are not unique.
Note that dead weakref cleanup happens as side effect of using the signal's receivers through the signals API.
Note that doing the cleanup here isn't a good idea, _remove_receiver() will be called as side effect of garbage collection, and so the call can happen while we are already holding self.lock.
Note that even if the group_by is set, it is only the minimal set to group by.
Note that for PostgreSQL the GROUP BY clause must include the primary key of every table, but for MySQL it is enough to have the main table's primary key.
Note that for historical reasons we want to include also private_fields here.
Note that if a model is unmanaged we short-circuit and never try to install it
Note that in Form.clean(), you have access to self.cleaned_data, a dictionary of all the fields/values that have *not* raised a ValidationError.
Note that in Python 3, maximum line length has increased from 76 to 78
Note that in this example we could just as well have the __gte clause and the OR clause swapped.
Note that ldflags goes at the end so that it has the option of overriding default settings earlier in the command line.
Note that libclang maintains a separate set of token enumerations from the C++ API.
Note that not all possible configuration values are present in this autogenerated file.
Note that on Oracle the table name is upper case in the generated SQL, thus the .lower() call.
Note that prefix should already be all lowercase.
Note that proxy_for_model can create a chain of proxy models.
Note that single quotes are used because this is a string (and could otherwise cause a collision with a field name).
Note that the _M versions need to come first for substring matching to work.
Note that the above filters on a force the join to an inner join even if it is trimmed.
Note that the caller is to be expecting a list in return, and not all callers do because not all are working in list context.
Note that the code below adds actions to this target, so if you move these two lines, move the lines below as well.
Note that the end result will be: (outercol NOT IN innerq AND outercol IS NOT NULL) OR outercol IS NULL.
Note that the first argument is assumed to be the command.
Note that the name has not changed - name is an attribute of Place, not ItalianRestaurant
Note that the offset in a TZ value is the negative of the way it's usually written, e.g. UTC+1 would be xxx-1:00.
Note that the single quote is repeated
Note that the stock python on SunOS has a bug where fcntl.flock(fd, LOCK_EX) always fails with EBADF, that's why we use this F_SETLK hack instead.
Note that there is a race between os.path.exists and os.makedirs: if os.makedirs fails with EEXIST, the directory was created concurrently, and we can continue normally.
Note that there is a race between os.path.exists and os.remove: if os.remove fails with ENOENT, the file was removed concurrently, and we can continue normally.
Note that these tests are testing internal implementation details.
Note that this class is different than Form.
Note that this could be accomplished in one try-except clause, but instead we use get_or_create when creating unknown users since it has built-in safeguards for multiple threads.
Note that this could cause an OverflowError here that we're not catching.
Note that this does /not/ update the translation unit.
Note that this expression matches the characters listed with "+", for 1 or more occurrences: if a string is empty, it must not match this pattern, because it needs to be encoded as "".
Note that this means results that might otherwise be distinct are not (if there are multiple values in the ordering cols), as in this example.
Note that this model doesn't have "get_latest_by" set.
Note that this must be two directories beneath src/ for unit tests to pass, as they reach into the src/ directory for data with relative paths.
Note that this only happens with the BuildConsole, and does not occur if IncrediBuild is executed from inside Visual Studio.
Note that this only scans back one line, since scanning back arbitrary number of lines would be expensive.
Note that this pattern will also pass on assignments of "0" to function pointers, but the preferred values for those would be "nullptr" or "NULL".
Note that this relies on the Python dict comparison operator comparing componentwise lexicographically based on the alphabetical ordering of keys.
Note that we accept C style "/* */" comments for terminating namespaces, so that code that terminate namespaces inside preprocessor macros can be cpplint clean.
Note that we calculate separately a list of extra select columns needed for grammatical correctness of the query, but these columns are not included in self.select.
Note that we can't just use ipaddress.ip_address() because we also have to accept ranges in place of each component.
Note that we can't trim joins at this stage - we will need the information about join type of the trimmed joins.
Note that we can't use an assertion because some of the gyp tests depend on this.
Note that we decide whether or not to create a Host based solely on the (non-)existence of its hostname in self.hosts.
Note that we don't have to detect malformed Javascript, only properly lex correct Javascript, so much of this is simplified.
Note that we don't need to execute a query, just build it.
Note that we may detect clash between user-defined non-unique field "id" and automatically added unique field "id", both defined at the same model.
Note that we must be careful so that we have params in the same order as we have the parts in the SQL.
Note that we must do the conversions in SQL instead of in Python to support F() references.
Note that we need to keep the original order intact, because cache implementations may rely on the order of the Vary contents in, say, computing an MD5 hash.
Note that we use ids instead of instances.
Note that we will be creating duplicate joins for non-m2m joins in the AND case.
Note that we're assuming OSError means that the client program isn't installed.
Note that we're calling MultiWidget, not SplitDateTimeWidget, because we want to define widgets.
Note that we're instantiating a new ModelChoiceIterator *each* time _get_choices() is called (and, thus, each time self.choices is accessed) so that we can ensure the QuerySet has not been consumed.
Note that you need to be careful here to use the flags that ccache and distcc can understand.
Note, for GeoIP Country, Region and Netspeed databases, GEOIP_INDEX_CACHE is equivalent to GEOIP_MEMORY_CACHE
Note, however, that this flexibility comes with the responsibility of displaying all the errors, including any that might not be associated with a particular field.
Note, if no dot is found, this will give the entire filename as the ext.
Note, not Iterable because we don't want to handle strings like that.
Note, sha1 is the only hash algorithm compatible with python2.4 and with FIPS-140 mode (as of 11-2014)
Note, we are using an id of 1006 here since tests that run before this may create categories with primary keys up to 6.
Note, we must cache the weakref versions.
Note: Do not add any code to this file.
Note: Don't make c++0x to c++11 so that c++0x can be used with older clangs that don't understand c++11 yet (like Xcode 4.2's).
Note: In Oracle, we expect a null CharField to return '' instead of None.
Note: No requirement for reset of auto-incremented indices (cf.
Note: Numeric values (including the names) should be consistent with '_GraphemeClusterBreakPropertyValue' enum on the Swift side, and with 'GraphemeClusterBreakProperty' in the compiler C++ code.
Note: Only used for loading obsolete VaultAES files.
Note: OpenBSD has sysutils/flock.
Note: Requires both the GeoIP country and city datasets.
Note: Requires use of both the GeoIP country and city datasets.
Note: The middle model is not actually a valid through model, but that doesn't matter, as we never render it.
Note: This could throw a unicode error if value's __str__() method returns non-ascii.
Note: This flag is a no-op for clang, it only has an effect for gcc.
Note: This is n_resources * n_outputs_in_rule.
Note: This test can result in false positives if #ifdef constructs get in the way of brace matching.
Note: Using nose's generator test cases here so we can't inherit from unittest.TestCase
Note: We use .decode() here, instead of six.text_type(s, encoding, errors), so that if s is a SafeBytes, it ends up being a SafeText at the end.
Note: Wellington has an 'X' value of 174, so it will not be considered to the left of CO.
Note: actool crashes if inputs path are relative, so use os.path.abspath to get absolute path name for inputs.
Note: by default PK ordering.
Note: caller is assumed to hold self.lock.
Note: docker supports running as non-root in some configurations.
Note: don't exclude the field from validation if the model field allows blanks.
Note: flat_list is already sorted in the order from dependencies to dependents.
Note: if a subclass overrides __init__(), it will likely need to override __copy__() and __deepcopy__() as well.
Note: if you change any of these parameters, don't forget to update the ASCII art above.
Note: in typical case this loop executes _strip_once once.
Note: intentionally no order_by(), that case needs tests, too.
Note: sh is the default shell plugin so this plugin may also be selected if the filename is not listed in any Shell plugin.
Note: slightly wrong, this is written so that implicit localhost Manage passwords
Note: std::hash is their hash, ::hash is our hash
Note: strings are encoded as UTF-8.
Note: table_alias is not necessarily known at instantiation time.
Note: the extra ordering must appear in select clause, so we get two non-distinct results here (this is on purpose, see #7070).
Note: the following three methods only work in subclasses that also inherit SingleObjectMixin or MultipleObjectMixin.
Note: there's no reason why we couldn't accept variable definitions here, and set them on the named child group.
Note: typecasting for datetimes is needed by some 3rd party database backends.
Note: vault should return byte strings because it could encrypt and decrypt binary files.
Note: verified we have SSLContext when we parsed params
Note: when combining the query we need to have information available about the join type of the trimmed "creator__isnull" join.
Note: zlogin invokes a shell (just like ssh does) so we do not pass this through /bin/sh -c here.
Nothing else can be a link dependency of them, there can only be dependencies in the sense that a dependent target might run an executable or load the loadable_module.
Nothing in the variable, default based on platform.
Nothing to add Write out the user file.
Nothing to do for an empty plan
Nothing to do if the connection is already open.
Nothing to do, as dates don't have tz information
Nothing to update if the field doesn't have dimension fields.
Nothing to update if we have no file and not being forced to update.
Notice that evaluateExpression doesn't work with variable arguments.
Notice that in the data argument, each field's key has the prefix, in this case 'person1', prepended to the actual field name.

Null denotation - called in prefix context
Null is legal, so existing members of the set that are not in the assignment set are set to null.
Null/not null queries
NullBooleanField is a bit of a special case because its presentation (widget) is different than its data.
NullBooleanField needs special-case null-handling, so it comes before the general null test.
NullTranslations() has no _catalog
Nullable relationships can be ignored -- they are nulled out before deleting, and therefore do not affect the order in which objects have to be deleted.
Number if items equal to per_page.
Number if items one less than per_page.
Number if items one more than per_page with one orphan.
Number if items one more than per_page.
Number of bits in the biggest int type

Obviously, we don't want that chunk in spelling.
Octal-encode to work around that.
Oddly, Xcode will quote any string with a run of three or more underscores.
Of course, this won't work right on Oracle objects that aren't MDSYS.SDO_GEOMETRY, but it is the only object type supported within Django anyways.
Offsetting the each ring in the polygon by 500.
Old hashes without version attribute
Old method of searching for which VS version is installed We don't use the 2010-encouraged-way because we also want to get the path to the binaries, which it doesn't offer.
Old systems using old simplejson module does not support encoding keyword.

On Jython there is no os.access()
On OSes that don't provide tzset (Windows), we can't set the timezone in which the program runs.
On Python 2, (n)gettext_lazy should not transform a bytestring to unicode
On Python 2, the default str() output will be the UTF-8 encoded output of __unicode__() -- or __str__() when the python_2_unicode_compatible decorator is used.
On Python 2, use the stdlib since `email.headerregistry` doesn't exist.
On Python 3, an `email.headerregistry.Address` object is used since email.utils.formataddr() naively encodes the name as ascii (see #25986).
On Python 3, the Unicode filesystem API will throw errors (#1474)
On Unix, and can't find pyxattr, setfattr, or xattr.
On Windows a file has to be closed before deleting

Ordering of extra() pieces is possible, too and you can mix extra fields and model fields in the ordering.
Ordering of points in the result of the union is not defined and implementation-dependent (DB backend, GEOS version)

Ordering should work with blank fieldsets.
Ordering uses the 'rhs' ordering, unless it has none, in which case the current ordering is used.

SNI Handling needs python2.7.9's SSLContext
SPLIT SALT, DIGEST, AND DATA
SQL annotation-related attributes The _annotations will be an OrderedDict when used.
SQL generated below works for SQLite databases because constraints don't exist
SQL-related attributes Select and related select clauses are expressions to use in the SELECT clause of the query.
SQL92 requires delimited (quoted) names to be case-sensitive.
SQL_AUTO_IS_NULL controls whether an AUTO_INCREMENT column on a recently inserted row will return when the field is tested for NULL.
SQLite also doesn't error properly
SQLite always runs at the SERIALIZABLE isolation level.
SQLite cannot handle us only partially reading from a cursor's result set and then writing the same rows to the database in another cursor.
SQLite doesn't actually give a name to the PK constraint, so we invent one.
SQLite doesn't actually support most of these types, but it "does the right thing" given more verbose field definitions, so leave them as is so that schema inspection is more useful.
SQLite doesn't enforce any integer constraints
SQLite doesn't have a power function, so we fake it with a user-defined function django_power that's registered in connect().
SQLite doesn't really have enforced references, but since it echoes out the SQL used to create the table we can look for REFERENCES statements used there.
SQLite doesn't support tz-aware datetimes
SQLite had a problem with more than 500 UNIONed selects in single query.
SQLite has a different format for field_type
SQLite lets objects be saved with an empty primary key, even though an integer is expected.
SQLite requires LIKE statements to include an ESCAPE clause if the value being escaped has a percent or underscore in it.
SQLite returns buffer/memoryview, cast to bytes for checking.

Silence an expected warning matching a regex
Silence the django.server logger by replacing its StreamHandler with NullHandler.
Silence warning on Python 2: Not importing directory 'tests/migrations/migrations_test_apps/without_init_file/migrations': missing __init__.py
Silencing serious issues like errors and criticals does not result in hiding the message, but Django will not stop you from e.g. running server.
Similar thing is done in is_nullable(), too.
Similar to a regular Form class you can define custom media to be used on the ModelForm.
Similar to the above, we only trigger if both sides are missing spaces to avoid false positives with shifts.
Similarly for select_related(), joins beyond an initial nullable join must use outer joins so that all results are included.
Similarly, changes to field attributes do not persist from one Form instance to the next.
Similarly, choices do not persist from one Form instance to the next.
Similarly, if we haven't seen an opening brace yet, but we already saw a closing parenthesis, then these are probably function arguments with extra "class" or "struct" keywords.
Similarly, the reporter ID can be a string.
Similarly, this type of code causes issues:
Simple ASCII address - string form
Simple ASCII address - tuple form
Simple cache set/get works
Simple demo that shows files that most contribute to total size.
Simple filter/exclude queries for good measure.
Simple playbook to invoke with the above example:
Simple tests for multiple GenericForeignKeys only uses one model, since the above tests should be sufficient.
SimpleHTTPRequestHandler.send_head() expects us to preserve the distinction between paths with and without a trailing slash, but posixpath.normpath() discards that distinction.
SimpleTestCase can be decorated by override_settings, but not ut.TestCase
Simply checking self.model._meta.proxy would not identify that case as involving multiple tables.
Simply removing data from form fields isn't the proper way to delete it.
Simulate a broken setUpTestData() method.
Simulate a missing `_apply_rel_filters` method.
Simulate a request that ends the session
Simulate a request the modifies the session
Simulate argument parsing to get the option defaults (see #10080 for details).

Simulate http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler.parse_request handling of raw request
Simulate that another thread is now rendering.
Simulate the effect of a one-off default.
Simulates a Swift compilation for the purposes of dependency analysis.
Since 'copies' can't run scripts, there's no need to write the env then.
Since Child6 inherits from Child4, the corresponding rows from f1 and f2 also appear here.
Since Engine is imported in django.template and since DjangoTemplates is a wrapper around this Engine class, local imports are required to avoid import loops.
Since HTTP_HOST is used to produce a meaningful reset URL, we need to be certain that the HTTP_HOST header isn't poisoned.
Since I could find no way to make foreach work with spaces in filenames correctly, the .d files have spaces replaced with another character.
Since Python's sqlite3 module doesn't expose the get_limit() C API, assume the default limits are in effect and split the work in batches if needed.
Since Student does not subclass CommonInfo's Meta, it has the effect of completely overriding it.
Since ``my_doodad.alters_data`` is True, the template system will not try to call our doodad but will use string_if_invalid
Since ``my_doodad.do_not_call_in_templates`` is True, the template system will not try to call our doodad.
Since both templates and all four contexts represent the same thing, they all render the same (and are returned as unicode objects and "safe" objects as well, for auto-escaping purposes).
Since environment variables can refer to other variables, the evaluation order is important.
Since flow v0.18.1 `--version` was deprecated in favor a `version` command
Since gyp doesn't support specify link_settings for each configuration, we are not able to link to different libraries in  "Debug" and "Release" configurations.
Since i18n tests run in less than 4 seconds, serializing them with SerializeMixin is acceptable.
Since it isn't possible to reimport a module safely (it could reexecute initialization code) all_models is never overridden or reset.
Since it's allow empty, next/prev are allowed to be empty months (#7164)
Since it's in memory, we'll never have multiple chunks.
Since make might not rebuild everything that could be declared here as an output, this extra compilation activity is unnecessary.
Since mapping might mix column names and default values, its values must be already quoted.
Since no pipes to read from are left, there is no need to call select() again.
Since our Solaris code doesn't depend on LooseVersion, do not import it on Solaris.
Since prefetching can re-use instances, it is possible to have the same instance multiple times in obj_list, so obj might already be prepared.
Since some toolsets might have been defined conditionally, perform a second round of toolsets expansion now.
Since tests are distributed across processes on a per-TestCase basis, there's no need for more processes than TestCases.
Since tests will be wrapped in a transaction, or serialized if they are not available, we allow queries to be run.
Since the CLT has no SDK paths anyway, returning None is the most sensible route and should still do the right thing.
Since the beginning of March 2016 twitch's paging mechanism is completely broken on the twitch side.
Since the connection is already closed, this crashes on some backends.
Since the default themes are not optimized for small screen space, using the same theme for HTML and epub output is usually not wise.
Since the default value for FileField subclasses is an instance of field.attr_class, previous_file will only be None when we are called from Model.__init__().
Since the input will have at least one ":" present before the password we can tell some things about the beginning and end of the data, though:
Since the list is guaranteed not to contain dicts, this won't do anything with conditions sections.
Since the parent and child are linked by an automatically created OneToOneField, you can get from the parent to the child by using the child's name.
Since the real purpose of the exempt decorator is to suppress the middleware's functionality, let's make sure it actually works...
Since the remainder of this function assumes that we're dealing with a package (module with a __path__), so if it's not, then bail here.
Since the results are sorted, binary search to find the range that matches.
Since the test database doesn't have tablespaces, it's impossible for Django to create the tables for models where db_tablespace is set.
Since the user isn't logged out at this point, the value of has_permission must be overridden.
Since this is a django.test.TestCase, a transaction is in progress and the isolation level isn't reported as 0.
Since this is for MSVS only settings, no translation will happen.
Since this is only a chunk, any error is an unfixable error.
Since this isn't a symmetrical relation, Tony's friend link still exists.
Since this isn't using FOR UPDATE, it won't block.
Since this method is called when models are imported, it cannot perform imports because of the risk of import loops.
Since this module gets imported in the application's root package, it cannot import models from other applications at the module level, and django.contrib.admin.forms eventually imports User.
Since this module gets imported in the application's root package, it cannot import models from other applications at the module level, and django.contrib.contenttypes.views imports ContentType.
Since this module gets imported in the application's root package, it cannot import models from other applications at the module level.
Since this overrides the inherited ModelChoiceField.clean we run custom validators here
Since this should only happen at compile time, that's probably OK.
Since those three dicts key on the class_name and neither regular modules nor powershell modules would have class_names, they would not work as written.
Since we add a nicely formatted traceback on our own, create a copy of the log record without the exception data.
Since we already have all of the data for the host, update the host details as well The old way was ksmeta only -- provide backwards compatibility
Since we didn't have an instance of the parent handy set attname directly, bypassing the descriptor.
Since we didn't run a NOT NULL change before we need to do it now
Since we disabled constraint checks, we must manually check for any invalid keys that might have been added
Since we displayed every form as blank, we will also accept them back as blank.
Since we just bypassed this class' get_queryset(), we must manage the reverse relation manually.
Since we only inherit from `list` for `isinstance` backward compatibility (Refs #17413) we nullify this iterator as it would otherwise result in duplicate entries.
Since we want to use the "safe" serializer for better interoperability, we need to do something with those pesky times.
Since we're going to assign directly in the cache, we must manage the reverse relation cache manually.
Since we're in a forked process, our best chance to communicate with them is to print to stdout.
Since we're not providing a request object, we must provide a domain_override to prevent the save operation from failing in the potential case where contrib.sites is not installed.
Since we're using the console-based backend as a base, force the stream to be None, so we don't default to stdout
Since we've just deleted all the rows, running our sequence ALTER code will reset the sequence to 0.
Since when formatting the error the request handler might access self.POST, set self._post and self._file to prevent attempts to parse POST data again.

Sleep for a little while.
Slightly less efficient as all processes with unexpected module names will wait on this lock
Slightly more advanced, we hid all of the password despite the ":"
Slower, kwargs-ready version.
Slugs are empty to start with.
Small file posting should work.
Small list with a variety of cases for tests that iterate on installed apps.
Smoketests -- these won't optimize but make sure that they don't traceback either
Snip out an extra 'lib' from libs if appropriate.
So I decided to implement a suggested change and consider the file completely downloaded if the file size differs less than 100 bytes from the one in the hard drive.
So can "inputs" and "outputs" sections of "actions" groups.
So depending on the current value of the field we have to dynamically construct some sort of "thing" to return.
So do as other gyp generators and use --start-group and --end-group.
So does a custom session with an idle expiration time of 0 (but it'll expire at browser close)
So don't error out in this case.
So far only the first token in command is assigned to command field.
So for now, we will allow it, unless the 'allow_sharedlib_linksettings_propagation' flag is explicitly set to False.
So if the first iter throws it, the second is *not* consumed.
So if the user is able to remove the file before your postprocessor runs it might cause a few problems.
So instead, we define our own __reduce__ method and custom unpickler.
So it's better to keep provided format_id intact.
So next should be in the future
So next should be in the future (yup, #7164, again)
So no need to do anything here
So ordering by name doesn't take place for Students.
So print a warning if we find any
So put it in LOCAL_CFLAGS.
So the MITM can circumvent the CSRF protection.
So the default query has to be adapted to include raster indices.
So things that are directly related to the core of ansible are in terms of that sort of connection that always originate on the controller.
So we can't check for an error being raised in that case for SQLite.
So we cannot store this in remote_tmpdir (use system tempdir instead)
So we check if the user set REMOTE_TMP to somewhere in or below /var/tmp and if so use /var/tmp.
So we don't need to do anything complicated for copying.
So we extract the ordered list and check the length.
So we first try on the class, in order to get the descriptor object.
So we give people a config option to affect display of the args so that they can secure this if they feel that their stdout is insecure (shoulder surfing, logging stdout straight to a file, etc).
So we have to split the exclude filter in the middle and then optimize the inner query without losing results.
So we let that error bubble up to the main thread.
So we need some book keeping to ensure we don't do duplicate work.
So we need to know exactly what kind of error it raises when there is an attempt to read more than the available bytes:
So we need to produce 2n backslashes.
So we need to produce 2n+1 backslashes.
So we need to remove the filter temporarily.
So we need to reset the details of the FieldFile in those cases.
So we need to try to create the file, but if it already exists we have to go back to get_available_name() and try again.
So we roll our own RFC-compliant parsing.
So we substitute in 2* what we match, +1 more, plus the quote.
So we try for a (large) number of times and then raise an exception.
So we'll need to construct a little silly template to trigger the escaping.
So, 'U0."id"' is referenced twice.
So, again a1 match, a2 not.
So, any existing inner join forces the join type to remain inner.
So, first do a call to an API method to force cleanup.
So, if we are already on an automatically added lookup, don't add the new lookups from relationships we've seen already.
So, in effect we are testing that we are promoting the fk_rel join to a left outer join here.
So, instead of doing...
So, it is essential that the pk numberings do not match.
So, it is safe to use INNER join.
So, make sure at least one field is selected.
So, now the a__f1 join doesn't need promotion.
So, per the docs, we reassign the list so the proxy picks up and notifies all other threads
So, run only on psycopg2 for that reason.
So, the Container class moves SomeModel outside of module level
So, the from_field is object_id field, to_field is pk because of the reverse join.
So, unusually, it doesn't make sense to run the tests individually, and if any are failing it is confusing to run them with any other set of tests.
So, use instance.pk (that is, parent_ptr_id) when asked for instance.id.
So, we have both an INNER and a LEFT join in the query.
So, we need to add cols in select, order_by, and having into the select in any case.
So, we need to confirm this.
So, we need to promote any existing INNER to LOUTER (it is possible this promotion in turn will be demoted later on).
So, we remove them from the PATH using the ANDROID_BUILD_PATHS variable set by envsetup.
So, we will retry all fragments that fail with 404 HTTP error for now.

Solaris 'ifconfig -a' will print interfaces twice, once for IPv4 and again for IPv6.
Solaris displays single digit octets in MAC addresses e.g. 0:1:2:d:e:f Add leading zero to each octet where needed.

Some of the following cached_properties can't be initialized in __init__ as the field doesn't have its model yet.
Some of the generation below can add extra output, sources, or link dependencies.
Some of them may now belong in in_degree_zeros.
Some of these data types have been commented out because they can't be used as a primary key on one or all database backends.
Some of these import cx_Oracle, so import them after checking if it's installed.

Sometimes code calls us naively -- it has a var which could contain a path to a tmp dir but doesn't know if it needs to exist or not.
Sometimes data or initial may be a string equivalent of a boolean so we should run it through to_python first to get a boolean value
Sometimes embedded video player is hidden behind percent encoding (e.g. https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/issues/2448) Unescaping the whole page allows to handle those cases in a generic way

Thanks to ww for this
That ensures that earlier replacements won't mess up the string in a way that causes later calls to find the earlier substituted text instead of what's intended for replacement.
That is how inlines are rendered and #9498 will bubble up if it is an issue.
That is, avoid trimming joins generated for F() expressions.
That is, it doesn't merge the trees.
That is, sequence of actions would be:
That isn't Django's problem.
That list is stored here.
That means that things need to be prepended to excluded_list to maintain them in the same order that they existed in the_list.
That means this has two tasks:
That means we have to handle -emit-bc and -c actions.
That missing table should cause detect_soft_applied() to return False.
That module has a much better description of what's going on and why.
That should not affect records of another database
That way users will see the comments with some nice usage instructions
That won't stop people trying to do this, so let's be explicit.
That would be considered invalid anyway.
That would let us make this code better (remove a single newline if preserve_trailing_newlines is False).
That would prepend the new items to the list in reverse order, which would be an unwelcome surprise.
That's OK, because you can create TaggedItems explicitly.

The 'meta' field is not always in the video webpage, we request it from another page
The 'seen_models' is used to optimize checking the needed parent alias for a given field.
The 'select' argument to extra() supports names with dashes in them, as long as you use values().
The 'sqlite3' backend requires only the ENGINE setting (an in- memory database will be used).
The 'target_build_files' key is only set when loading target build files in the non-parallel code path, where LoadTargetBuildFile is called recursively.

The following appears to be as-yet undocumented.
The following are os.path.expanduser implementations from cpython 2.7.8 stdlib for different platforms with correct environment variables decoding.
The following are stealth options used by Django's internals.
The following attributes could be defined at the class level in a subclass, hence the test-and-set pattern.
The following commands are available:
The following drawing explains how it is implemented:

The following functions are used to get the units, their name, and the spheroid corresponding to the SRID of the BaseSpatialField.
The following line removes the corresponding None parameter.
The following makes it easier for us to script updates of the bundled code
The following methods cannot be implemented in __getattr__, because the code must run when the method is invoked, not just when it is accessed.
The following methods form the public API for storage systems, but with no default implementations.
The following methods represent a public interface to private methods.
The following pattern is required to ensure values from context override those from template context processors.

The following tests examine expected behavior given a custom URLconf that overrides the default one through the request object.
The following three functions are used to programatically define data descriptors (aka properties) for the Attributes of all of the playbook objects (tasks, blocks, plays, etc).
The following two queries must be done in the same order as written, otherwise 'primary_house' will cause non-prefetched lookups
The following will be aware in UTC.
The force_escape filter assume unicode, make sure that works
The foreign key field might not be on the form, so we poke at the Model field to get the label, since we need that for error messages.
The form itself is valid, but no email is sent
The form should not validate fields that it doesn't contain even if they are specified using 'fields', not 'exclude'.
The form should still have an instance of a model that is not complete and not saved into a DB yet.
The form validation should fail because 'some_required_info' is not included on the parent form, and the family_name of the parent does not match that of the child
The format is a list of tuples containing the path and title.
The format of PkgInfo is eight characters, representing the bundle type and bundle signature, each four characters.
The formset is valid even though poem.pk + 1 doesn't exist, because it's marked for deletion anyway
The found starting point is likely a Join instead of a BaseTable reference.
The full path of the source file
The full path of the target file
The full version, including alpha/beta/rc tags.
The function signature is a little strange because of how we define them.
The funky name reduces the chance of an accidental clash.
The general idea is to take a union of itags of both DASH manifests (for example video with such 'manifest behavior' see https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/issues/6093)
The generator flag 'xcode_serialize_all_test_runs' controls the forcing of all tests serially.
The generator is not passed to the 'for' loop, because it does a list(values) instead, call gen.next() in the template to control the generator.
The generators can provide more keys, the two lists are merged into path_sections, but you should call IsPathSection instead of using either list directly.
The geographic type of the field.
The geometry field of the model is set here.
The geometry is passed in as a parameter because we handled transformation conditions in this routine.
The geometry type must match that of the field -- unless the general GeometryField is used.
The get needs to be targeted at the write database in order to avoid potential transaction consistency problems
The get() needs to be targeted at the write database in order to avoid potential transaction consistency problems.
The given lonlat is the center of the tile.
The group_by attribute can have one of the following forms: - None: no group by at all in the query - A list of expressions: group by (at least) those expressions.
The guard should be PATH_FILE_H_, but we also allow PATH_FILE_H__ for backward compatibility.
The hardcoded condition is a code smell but we can't rely on a flag on the command class because we haven't located it yet.
The harness chooses a number of iterations for each tests to achieve the best accuracy in the given time limit (in order to do that, it performs several auxiliary test runs).
The harness makes a separate test from each of these functions, runs all the tests and reports aggregate results.
The header must fit within one chunk.
The headers phase should come before the resources, sources, and frameworks phases, if any.
The heading for the m2m inline block uses the right text
The help text is displayed whether or not data is provided for the form.
The host must be valid
The id_for_label property of the subwidget should return the ID that is used on the subwidget's tag
The idea is that all these creations and saving should work without crashing.
The idea is that we scan once here and collect all the information we need to make future decisions.
The image will normally need to be rebuilt every time chrome's build dependancies are changed.
The implementation of last_executed_queries isn't optimal.
The implicit make rules have it looking for RCS files, among other things.
The import .lib is the output of a build step, but because dependents only link against the lib (not both the lib and the dll) we keep track of the import library here.
The import path is hardcoded and should be the right place, so we are not expecting an ImportError.
The in operator can be used to inspect cache contents
The include line must include at least one item, which is the filename to include.
The include_state object keeps track of the highest type seen, and complains if we see a lower type after that.
The included_files entries are relative to the dir of the build file that included them, so we have to undo that and then make them relative to the root dir.
The individual parsers will raise an error if we feed them something they can't digest.
The individual targets need to be merged into the defaults.
The inherited dict provides __getitem__, __len__, __contains__, and get.
The inner CharField is missing a max_length.
The input is the result of a gettext_lazy() call.
The instance dict contains whatever was originally assigned in __set__.
The instance doesn't have m2m data yet
The instance representation is set by model's __str__()
The intermediate m2m model is not auto created if: 1) There is a manually specified intermediate, or 2) The class owning the m2m field is abstract.
The internal self.__map dictionary maps keys to links in a doubly linked list.
The internal value is preserved if using HiddenInput (#7753).
The isvalid lookup doesn't make sense for rasters.
The join is direct and not nullable so we can use INNER JOIN for it.
The join table of the ManyToManyField goes to the model's tablespace, and its indexes too, unless DEFAULT_INDEX_TABLESPACE is set.
The join_field is the field backing the relation.
The joined path was located outside of this template_dir (it might be inside another one, so this isn't fatal).
The json file contains the info of all the videos in the section
The kernel uses the following, but it seems like it would have false positives, where one string reordered its arguments.
The key is the alias of the joined table (possibly the table name) and the value is a Join-like object (see sql.datastructures.Join for more information).
The key is the tool name, the value is a dictionary mapping setting names to conversion functions.
The key is the tool name, the value is a dictionary mapping setting names to validation functions.
The keys are the supported sites and the values are the name to be shown to the user and in the extractor description.
The keyword argument has already been supplied once
The keyword arguments for model construction.
The kwarg was successfully extracted
The label may not start or end with a hyphen or an underscore.

The last line of a dependency list.
The last line of a project definition.
The last resort is to try direct unsigned hls/hds URLs from info dictionary.
The last segment looks like a path.
The last segment looks like an environment setting or cli argument.
The ldflags config key is not used on mac or win.
The left/right lookup tests are known failures on PostGIS 2.0/2.0.1 http://trac.osgeo.org/postgis/ticket/2035
The length does not match, we start the download over
The library module classes fail if the stem is set.
The limit_choices_to on the parent field says that a parent object's number attribute must be 10, so this should fail validation.
The link already exists.
The link with index 0 is not the first video of the playlist (not sure if still actual)
The list itself can't influence the variables dict, and ProcessVariablesAndConditionsInList will make copies of the variables dict if it needs to pass it to something that can influence it.
The list of apps that are handled
The list of ports must be in a valid format
The list of targets upon which the 'all' target should depend.
The loaded salary of 3000 gets saved, the name of 'Clerk' isn't overwritten.
The locale directory for this app is generated automatically by the test cases.
The log directory exists
The log_out function will still trigger the signal for anonymous users.
The logic here is: if the main model's primary key is in the query, then set new_expressions to that field.
The long type was removed in Python 3.
The lookup below helps selecting the right ctypes object for a given gdal pixel type.
The loop variables were pushed on to the context so pop them off again.
The low bit of the unpacked value is the sign.
The low level calls above do not preserve the newline characters at the end of the input data, so we use the calculate the difference in newlines and append them to the resulting output for parity
The low precision is for SpatiaLite
The low precision tolerance is for SpatiaLite
The lower-case forms are of course incorrect and unofficial, but we support those too
The m2m data won't be saved until save_m2m() is invoked on the form.
The main benchmark emits its own line.
The main event -- substitute the JSON args string into the module
The main things we want for sure are (a) simple external access to kinds, (b) a place to hang a description and name, (c) easy to keep in sync with Index.h.
The make generator does this always.
The make generator doesn't support it, so forbid it everywhere to keep the generators more interchangable.
The makefile rules are all relative to the top dir, but the gyp actions are defined relative to their containing dir.
The managers on this model should be ordered by their creation counter and not by the order in model body
The mapping is 0: default, 1: false, 2: true.
The master app registry is always ready when the tests run.
The master toctree document.

The maximum number we can get with each request
The maximum value of the first level index for supp tables.
The md5 checksum changes
The md5 checksum changes on each download
The mechanism for getting at the related model is slightly odd - ideally, we'd just ask for field.related_model.
The mesh should be smooth and soft.
The message is optional, in which case None is stored for each rule source.
The missing MOCK_METHOD is usually one or two lines back, so scan back one or two lines.
The missing spaces will be flagged by CheckSpacing.
The mixes are generated from a single video the id of the playlist is just 'RD' + video_id
The model being renamed does not participate in this relation directly.
The model field name.
The model was auto-created as intermediary for a ManyToMany-relationship, find the target model
The models definitions below used to crash.
The models will get auto-added into the state, though so we're fine.
The module to store session data
The msvs specific sections that hold paths
The multiprocessing pool.
The name "fixture5" is ambiguous, so loading it will raise an error
The name for this set of Sphinx documents.
The name isn't shared by one of the instances (i.e., the default) so pick the first instance as the default.
The name of an image file (relative to this directory) to place at the top of the title page.
The name of the DOCUMENTATION template
The name of the Pygments (syntax highlighting) style to use.
The name of the builddir.
The name of the current section.
The name of the file uploaded and the file stored in the server-side shouldn't differ.
The name refers to module.
The need for this setting is explained above where _intermediate_var is defined.
The new file is different from the old one, or there is no old one.
The new file is identical to the old one, just get rid of the new one.
The new temporary file is then compared to the existing project file, if any.
The newly selected pk should appear in the raw id input.
The next common higher level is __init__.py::run() and that has tasks inside of play_iterator so we'd have to extract them to do it there.
The next connect() will reset the transaction state anyway.
The nocolor palette has all available roles.
The nodata value is part of the PGRaster string even if the nodata flag is True, so it always has to be chunked off the data string.
The non-hack way to fix this is to have powershell modules be a different PluginLoader/ModuleLoader.
The non-optimized version works, too.
The normal client allows the post
The notice and error handler C function callback definitions.
The number of arguments the function accepts.
The number of days a password reset link is valid for
The number of pixels per zoom level.
The number of zoom levels
The numbers amount is picked to force three different IN batches for Oracle, yet to be less than 2100 parameter limit for MSSQL.
The numbers are Apple radar IDs.
The numeric mode to assign to newly-created directories, when uploading files.
The numeric mode to set newly-uploaded files to.
The object User1 edited in step 3 is displayed on the changelist and has the correct edits applied.
The object isn't saved an thus the relation field is null - we won't even execute a query in this case.
The object_list is converted to a list so that if it was a QuerySet it won't be a database hit per __getitem__.
The objects are called "str" in both py2 and py3 but they mean different things.
The old method above does not work when only SDK is installed.
The old related instance was thrown away (the selfref_id has changed).
The old state keeps as-is, we continue with the new state
The only difference is the depth of the nesting as we now use 4 models instead of 3 (and thus 3 relations).
The only differences are the last two parts.
The only dirctories where that is standard are the tmp dirs, /tmp and /var/tmp.
The only exception is inside 'atomic' blocks.
The only exception we regularly allow is "unsigned short port" for port.
The only other case we accept is a ':'-separated list of patterns.
The only place where you can get a title, it's not complete, but searching in other places doesn't work for all videos
The only slight complexity here is handling fields that exist on parent models.
The only subclass of PBXGroup, PBXVariantGroup, should not participate in reparenting in the same way: reparenting by merging different object types would be wrong.
The only tricky thing here is to ensure that we do the related selections properly after unpickling.
The only workaround is to put rules and their inputs in a separate target from the one that compiles the rule outputs.
The opening angle bracket is probably there if we look for it, so just return early here.
The operation failed, possibly because the file is set to read-only.
The operation id, informed by the client and returned by the server to make sure both are talking about the same thing.
The option can be either in the form "-I /path/to/dir" or "-I/path/to/dir" so handle both.
The opus codec doesn't support the -aq option
The order of the (empty) values, annotate and extra clauses doesn't matter
The order of these fields matter, do not change.
The ordering by others__single__pk will add one new join (to single) and that join must be LEFT join.
The ordering can be altered
The ordering of model fields might vary depending on several factors (version of GDAL, etc.)
The ordering of the zip calls matter - zip throws StopIteration when an iter throws it.
The ordering required to allow for monkeypatching causes the warning "I100 Import statements are in the wrong order." when linting using flake8-import-order.
The ordering we really want is objects, mgr1, mgr2
The original parent had a sourceTree set, use it.
The original problem was that the inner queries weren't relabeled correctly.
The original query still works correctly
The original version of Livestream uses a different system
The other intelligent aspects of merge processing won't apply because item is being merged into an empty dict.
The other option, PROJECT_DERIVED_FILE_DIR, is unsuitable because while it is project-specific, it is not configuration-specific.
The other project reports its path as relative to the same directory that this project's path is relative to.
The other project's path is not necessarily already relative to this project.
The other way is to subclass the original lookup and register the subclassed lookup instead of the original.
The outermost takes precedence.
The output of virtinfo is different whether we are on a machine with logical domains ('LDoms') on a T-series or domains ('Domains') on a M-series.
The page shouldn't display a link to the nonexistent change page
The paper size ('letterpaper' or 'a4paper').
The parameter that should be used in the query string for that filter.
The parent object should have been deleted as well.
The parent_link connector need not be the pk on the model.
The particular cache to look for modules within.
The path of last found header.
The path of the session cookie.
The path travelled, this includes the path to the multijoin.
The path type is needed for regenerating, for optparse we can just treat it as a string.
The path.join_field is a Rel, lets get the other side's field
The paths in build_files were relativized above, so undo that before testing against the non-relativized items in target_list and before calculating the Makefile path.
The paths were the same.
The patterns below are used to generate SQL pattern lookup clauses when the right-hand side of the lookup isn't a raw string (it might be an expression or the result of a bilateral transformation).
The person has been deleted ...
The person still exists ...
The pgpass temporary file needs to be encoded using the system locale.
The pickled state is simply a tuple of the WKB (in string form) and the SRID.
The platform module provides information about the running system/distribution.
The playpath starts at 'mp4:', if we don't manually split the url, rtmpdump will incorrectly parse them
The point for La Grange, TX
The policy is that if you #include something in foo.h you don't need to include it again in foo.cc.
The positional arguments here extract the hex-encoded srid from the header of the PostGIS raster string.
The pre-existing join should remain INNER.
The prefix to put on the default database name when creating the test database.
The prerequisites for this rule are the rule source itself and the set of additional rule inputs, if any.
The previous changes shouldn't affect nullable foreign key joins.
The previous technique dealt with "hard-coded" initial data, but it's also possible to specify initial data after you've already created the Form class (i.e., at runtime).
The previous technique dealt with raw values as initial data, but it's also possible to specify callable data.
The primary key can be accessed via the pk property on the model.
The primary key must also obviously be unique, so trying to create a new object with the same primary key will fail.
The primary key must be specified, so an error is raised if you try to create an object without it.
The problem here was that b__name generates a LOUTER JOIN, then b__c__name generates join to c, which the ORM tried to promote but failed as that join isn't nullable.
The process here is identical to ITERATING_TASKS, except instead we move into the always portion of the block.
The process is terminated.
The proper fix would be to defer all decisions where is_nullable() is needed to the compiler stage, but that is not easy to do currently.
The publisher should have one book.
The publisher should have three books.
The query structure is such that we have multiple nested subqueries.
The query.group_by is either None (no GROUP BY at all), True (group by select fields), or a list of expressions to be added to the group by.
The queryset must be reduced to a list of values using values(), then converted into a query
The raster in the model is not strictly below
The raster in the model is strictly below
The rationale behind the 32MB can be found on Django's Trac: https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/5596#comment:4
The reST default role (used for this markup: `text`) to use for all documents.
The reason for not subtracting and escaping "/" is that we are escaping the entire path, not a path segment.
The receiver is either a function or an instance of class defining a `__call__` method.
The redirect target responds with a 301 code, not 200
The referer is empty.
The referer is equal to the current URL, ignoring the scheme (assumed to be a poorly implemented bot).
The regular expression we use to match compiler-crasher lines.
The related _model_, not a field was passed in -- indicating another mapping for the related Model.
The related fetches are done in batches.
The related instance is loaded from the database and then cached in the attribute defined in self.cache_name.
The related object is registered with the same AdminSite
The related_id is alawys set even if it's not fetched from the DB, so pk and related_id are not deferred.
The relationship model is not installed.
The remaining bits point to the next blockable in the chain.
The remaining elements of an object dictionary are sorted alphabetically.
The remaining methods are order-aware.
The remote user we will request from docker (if supported)
The reorder_for_init attribute contains a function used to reorder the field data in the order __init__ expects it.
The reprojection of a raster that spans over a large area skews the data matrix and might introduce nodata values.
The request logger receives events for any problematic request The security logger receives events for all SuspiciousOperations
The request was a followed redirect
The resolver is checked recursively (examining url()s in include()).
The resources phase should come before the sources and frameworks phases, if any.
The response also converts unicode or bytes keys to strings, but requires them to contain ASCII
The rest of the exception message differs between Python 2 and 3.
The rest of the tokens
The result of the lookup should be translated at rendering time.
The resulting form subclass will have all of the fields of the parent Form, plus whichever fields you define in the subclass.
The results will be correct but this creates too many joins.
The return type is derived from the composed aggregate
The reverse relation also works if the OneToOneField is null.
The right callable should be used for the inline readonly_fields column cells
The role must be in upper case
The root directory used for deriving header guard CPP variable.
The rule action script would need to touch the dummy.
The rule message and action have already had the necessary variable substitutions performed.
The rules are - The priority from low to high is gcc/g++, the 'make_global_settings' in gyp, the environment variable.
The runtime for Argon2 is too complicated to implement a sensible hardening algorithm.
The safe-guarding will be handled at a higher level by the `BaseDatabaseWrapper.allow_thread_sharing` property.
The same behavior for iexact query.
The same condition is often evaluated over and over again so it makes sense to cache as much as possible between evaluations.
The same for our new query.
The same request through a different middleware won't hit
The same request with a timeout _will_ hit
The same result can occur in some rare cases when the database returns zero despite the UPDATE being executed successfully (a row is matched and updated).
The same should happen with a lookup by natural key
The same test case as the last one, but for one-to-one models, which are implemented slightly different internally, so it's a different code path.
The same video as https://twitter.com/i/videos/tweet/705235433198714880 Test case of TwitterCardIE
The same, but for run_test_targets.
The save is also forced to be raw.
The save method is a raw base model save, to make sure that the data in the database matches the exact test case.
The save_as_new parameter lets you re-associate the data to a new instance.
The saved stack will allow us to restore the parsing state in the #else case.
The savepoint won't be reused.
The script wrapper of the library is for testing purpose.
The second argument is an addition that causes a pylint warning.
The second block has a savepoint and must roll back.
The second buffer will need to be transformed, however.
The second byte indicates whether the interface is in promiscuous mode.
The second condition avoids creating useless savepoints and prevents overwriting needs_rollback until the rollback is performed.
The second insert couldn't be roll back.
The second item should be a boolean indicating whether files should be added into hierarchical groups or one single flat group.
The second union aggregate is for a union query that includes limiting information in the WHERE clause (in other words a `.filter()` precedes the call to `.aggregate(Union()`).
The second user only exists on the default database
The second user only exists on the other database
The second value is normalized to an empty name by MultiPartParser.IE_sanitize()
The secret internal related names for self-referential many-to-many fields shouldn't appear in the list when an error is made.
The select is used for cases where we want to set up the select clause to contain other than default fields (values(), subqueries...) Note that annotations go to annotations dictionary.
The select, klass_info, and annotations are needed by QuerySet.iterator() these are set as a side-effect of executing the query.
The select_related join was promoted as there is already an existing join.
The select_related join wasn't promoted as there was already an existing (even if trimmed) inner join to state.
The self-weakref trick is needed to avoid creating a reference cycle.
The sensitive_variables decorator was used, so we take note of the sensitive variables' names.
The sentinel element never gets deleted (this simplifies the algorithm).
The server URL is hardcoded
The server doesn't support HEAD request, the generic extractor can't detect the redirection
The server doesn't support HEAD requests
The server time may be different from local time
The session doesn't exist to start.
The session is accessed so "Vary: Cookie" should be set.
The session should be deleted only if the session is entirely empty
The set of all build files that have been scheduled, so we don't schedule the same one twice.
The settings are: filetype : used for explicitFileType in the project file prefix : the prefix for the file name suffix : the suffix for the file name
The shared dictionary for notified handlers is a proxy, which does not detect when sub-objects within the proxy are modified.
The shared library for the GeoIP C API.
The short X.Y version.
The similarity of the code below to the code in ForwardManyToOneDescriptor is annoying, but there's a bunch of small differences that would make a common base class convoluted.
The slugs got prepopulated didn't change since they were originally not empty
The slugs got prepopulated since they were originally empty
The solution is to move the include out of the #ifdef.
The source can't be found.
The source directory tree.
The spaces within the variables are valid, so remove the variables before checking.
The spec explicitly defined an external builder, so don't change it.
The spec only allows ASCII.
The specified ports may be of the form '8000-8010,8080,9200-9300' i.e. a comma-separated list of ports or ranges of ports, so we break it down into a detailed list of all possible ports.
The src is a file pointing to the real video file
The standard File contains most of the necessary properties, but FieldFiles can be instantiated without a name, so that needs to be checked for here.
The storage doesn't support get_modified_time() or failed
The style sheet to use for HTML and HTML Help pages.
The sub-expression `source` has already been resolved, as this is just a reference to the name of `source`.
The subclasses for OGR Geometry.
The subcommands in this function make it easier to debug ziploader modules.
The subgroup names must themselves be declared as groups, but as before, they may only be declared later.
The subject is only checked when there is no dNSName entry in subjectAltName
The subquery result cache should not be populated
The suffix of source filenames.
The super block will still be found.
The super call needs to happen first because it uses the database.
The super calls needs to happen first for the settings override.
The supp tables contain entries for BMP code units to simplify trie implementation, but those BMP entries are filled with the default value, so they compress well.
The support project also gets the dependencies (in case they are needed for the actions/rules to work).
The supported URL schemes
The sysroot directory should match the one specified in build/common.gypi.
The sysroot image could be constructed from scratch based on the current state or Debian Wheezy but for consistency we currently use a pre-built root image.
The sysroot is needed to make Chrome work for Debian Wheezy.
The table is manually created by the test method.
The tablespaces to use for each model when not specified otherwise.
The target doesn't contain the source, but the dependent targets have not yet been visited to determine a more specific status yet.
The target has a dependency on another target that contains one of the supplied paths.
The target is linkable, add it to the list of link dependencies.
The target's sources contain one of the supplied paths.
The target's sources weren't in the supplied paths and none of the target's dependencies depend upon a target that matched.
The territory overrides NLS_DATE_FORMAT and NLS_TIMESTAMP_FORMAT to the territory default.
The test is going to access a static file stored in this application.
The test needs to be done on a specific string as IOError is raised even without the patch (just not early enough)
The test still lives here to factor it between other backends.
The test suite relies on this in testing exit().
The tests are similar since they both set up a situation where the system time zone, Django's TIME_ZONE, and UTC are distinct.
The third insert couldn't be roll back.
The thread should immediately block, but we'll sleep for a bit to make sure.
The through model has dependencies to them though, so it should come last.
The tolerance value is to four decimal places because of differences between the Oracle and PostGIS spatial backends on the extent calculation.
The total number of forms will remain the same in either case
The tracks usually expire after 1 months, so we can't add tests.
The transaction is marked as needing rollback.
The translation unit cursor exists primarily to act as the root cursor for traversing the contents of a translation unit.
The tuple and coords properties
The tuple may be a point or a box
The two Note items should be different.
The two new passwords do not match.
The two sets do not intersect, meaning the pk isn't present.
The two templates should not have the same content
The type with "+bundle" appended will be used if the target has "mac_bundle" set.
The typedef is a declaration of size_type (CXCursor_TypedefDecl), while the type of the variable "size" is referenced.
The underlying database connection.
The underlying query only makes one join when a related table is referenced twice.
The unique kind objects, index by id.
The unique kind objects, indexed by id.
The unmanaged models need to be removed after the test in order to prevent bad interactions with the flush operation in other tests.
The unquoted segments are at the even-numbered indices.
The unwrapped value is returned as the first item of the arguments tuple.
The update() command can update fields in parent and child classes at once (although it executed multiple SQL queries to do so).
The url doesn't have an rtmp app, we have to extract the playpath
The url fields should be able to accurately detect where the password ends so the length should be the same:
The url may contain the language
The use of 'user' in the Play datastructure was deprecated to line up with the same change for Tasks, due to the fact that 'user' conflicted with the user module.
The use of an API key is _required_.
The use of from_field comes from the need to avoid cascade back to parent when parent delete is cascading to child.
The use of more than one of these options together will trigger an Error
The user can't add sections yet, so they shouldn't see the "add section" link.
The user can't change sections yet, so they shouldn't see the "change section" link.
The user can't delete sections yet, so they shouldn't see the "delete section" link.
The user has already confirmed the deletion.
The user has confirmed the deletion.
The user is inactive, but our custom form policy allows them to log in.
The user is inactive.
The user needs to have the change permission for the related model in order to be able to do anything with the intermediate model.
The user submits an invalid username.
The user will find out once they execute the command.
The value doesn't matter, we just need any negative constraint on a related model that's a noop.
The value formatting is cute, but not really used right now.
The value from the form's initial data is used.
The value is too big for IPv6.
The value of inherit_unique_symroot decides, if a configuration is assumed to inherit a unique 'SYMROOT' attribute from its parent, if it doesn't define an explicit value for 'SYMROOT'.
The value of this option must be the base URL from which the finished HTML is served.
The value will end up being ignored by our __reduce__ and custom unpickler.
The values should be Geometry objects and not raw strings returned by the spatial database.
The values to use for "blank" in SelectFields.
The values() command also works on fields from parent models.
The values() method works with "extra" fields specified in extra(select).
The variable name is the key name in the "variables" dict.
The variable name is the key name with a "_" character prepended.
The variant group name is the same as the basename (MainMenu.nib in the example above).
The verbose_name, in particular, did not always work.
The verification password is incorrect.
The version that we will be importing the tests from.
The very last bit must be the context name
The video id is in the redirected url
The video in the original webpage now uses PlayWire
The videos are contained in a single page the ajax pages can't be used, they are empty
The videos usually expire in 7 days, so we can't add tests.
The when has already been evaluated by this point, and is not used again, so we don't care about mangling that value now
The whole block is an inline assembly block Match start of assembly blocks
The widget will use the choices defined on the Field, not the ones defined on the Widget.
The wish is that the instance has been already saved to DB, although having a pk value isn't a guarantee of that.
The workaround is to put a "conditions" section within a "variables" section.
The workflow of the harness is the following: o Basing on the input files, generate 'processed' files.
The xcode build is relative to a gyp file's directory, and OTHER_LDFLAGS can contain entries that depend on this.
The xcode generator special-cases global xcode_settings and does something that amounts to merging in the global xcode_settings into each local xcode_settings dict.
The xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax of the MultiPoint should be returned.
Their spelling never changes and is consequently provided by this spelling cache.
Theme options are theme-specific and customize the look and feel of a theme further.
Then check that the round trip works.
Then delete the existing file if really needed
Then filter out specific passes.
Then gather them from the model admin and all parent classes, starting with self and working back up.
Then get the history for this object.
Then make sure that it *does* pass validation and delete the object, even though the data in new forms aren't actually valid.
Then make sure that it *does* pass validation and delete the object, even though the data isn't actually valid.
Then remove each related field
Then standard model tables
Then visit all subclasses
Then we'll use the formset to validate/process POSTed data.
Then when it gets merged kill your hack.
Then write out an edge using the rule.
Then yield the thing we found.
Then, add the path to the query's joins.
Then, if we have a match, redo the substitution with quoted arguments in order to return a properly encoded URL.
Then, make a Model object (apps.register_model is called in __new__)
Then, we let every list filter modify the queryset to its liking.
Then, with explicitly enabling the connection for sharing.
Then, work out our bases
There 's no 'Choose all' button in vertical mode, so individually select all options and click 'Choose'.
There 's no 'Remove all' button in vertical mode, so individually select all options and click 'Remove'.
There are a couple of ways to do multiple-field validation.
There are certain situations we allow one space, notably for section labels
There are different sources of video in arte.tv, the extraction process is different for each one.
There are multiple videos in the playlist whlie only the first one matches the video played in browsers

There are no reparse options available in libclang yet.
There are three books with rating of 4.0 and two of the books have the same price.
There are three ways we might decide not to print an error message: a "NOLINT(category)" comment appears in the source, the verbosity level isn't high enough, or the filters filter it out.
There aren't any options to control this.
There can be more than one ETag in the request, so we consider the list of values.
There can be multiple action forms on the page (at the top and bottom of the change list, for example).
There currently aren't.
There exist no State models for the ForeignKey mapping to work -- should raise a MissingForeignKey exception (this error would be ignored if the `strict` keyword is not set).
There is a possibility the .git file to have an absolute path.
There is a property is_geoprotection, but that's always false
There is a similar test in `layermap` that uses the same data set, but the County model here is a bit different.
There is always one test group, for the HTTP server errors.
There is currently no logic on deciding what these nontrivial things are, so this check is triggered by namespace size only, which works most of the time.
There is no Express edition for 2015.
There is no one endpoint for album metadata - instead it is included/repeated in each song's metadata Therefore we don't know how many songs the album has and must infi-loop until failure
There is nothing we can do about this.
There is only the base table in use in the query.
There isn't a generic way to test that cursors are closed, but psycopg2 offers us a way to check that by closed attribute.
There isn't any object on the remote side of the fk_rel relation.
There may be junk add the end of the file See http://stackoverflow.com/q/4928560/35070 for details
There may be other processes with this particular pattern in it.
There may need to be some other mechanism where we exclude certain kinds of field attributes, or make this list more automatic in some way so we don't have to remember to update it manually.
There may not be a 'server_thread' attribute if setUpClass() for some reasons has raised an exception.
There once was a problem with Form fields called "data".
There should always be a space between the // and the comment
There should be 1 entry in each database
There should be at most one ResultType chunk and it should tell us type of suggested expression.
There should be no creation errors, since we have told Django they aren't managed by Django.
There should be no more than one on a given port.
There should be one unique_together tuple.
There should be three Authors in total.
There should be three cities in the shape file.
There should only be one GROUP BY clause, for the `id` column.
There should probably be some way for that module to push the names in, rather than having to hard-code them here.
There should still be no members in CIA
There shouldn't be any operations pending at this point.
There shouldn't be space around unary operators
There was a but that caused _meta ordering to be used.
There was some problems with form translations in #5216
There were "issues" when ordering and distinct-ing on fields related via ForeignKeys.
There were some issues with various Paramiko versions.
There will be more chances to add it to flat_list when examining it again as a dependent of those other dependencies, provided that there are no cycles.
There will be no check errors in the other M2M because it specifies db_column for the FK in `through` model even if the actual name is longer than the limits of the database.
There would be a clash if Model.field installed an accessor.
There's a known GDAL regression with retrieving the extent of a VRT layer in versions 1.7.0-1.7.2: http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/3783
There's a possibility OSError would be raised for some other reason, in which case this error message would be inaccurate.
There's a race condition with the controller removing the remote_tmpdir and this module executing under async.
There's a special case for "for" since the style guide allows space before the semicolon there.
There's already a PBXBuildFile in this phase corresponding to the PBXVariantGroup.
There's no FK to exclude, so no exclusion checks are required.
There's no FK, but we do need to confirm that the ct_field and ct_fk_field are valid, and that they are part of a GenericForeignKey.
There's no `length_sphere`, and `length_spheroid` also works on 3D geometries.
There's no compelling reason for Xcode's linker invocations to differ.
There's no need for the model fields to validate them as well.
There's no need to write anything into the script to ensure that the output directories already exist, because Xcode will look at the declared outputs and automatically ensure that they exist for us.
There's no reason to move if we don't have to.
There's no reason to not respect the umask here, which means that an extra hoop is required to fetch it and reset the new file's mode.
There's no simple way to determine whether an URL is a playlist or not So detect it
There's no way to trigger a syntax error with the dummy backend.
There's nothing unique about this PBXGroup, and if left alone, it will wind up with the same set of hashables as all other PBXGroup objects owned by the projectReferences list.
There's only one ChordsBand instance
There's only one Concert instance
There's only one Group instance
There's only one Quartet instance
There's only one format available
There's two levels of architecture/platform specification in VS.
Therefore avoid the cost of conversion.
Therefore for extraction pass we have to override Accept-Encoding to any in order to accept raw bytes and being able to download only a chunk.
Therefore we don't check that the user is root when using this connection.
Therefore we pass these three filters as filters to the generator.
Therefore, on py2k, the bytes are actually a str object and can't be used in the utf8 validator as we need integers when we get each byte one by one.
Therefore, the port is not available for Nuclide server.
Therefore, we can't use isinstance() to check for the six meta path importer, since the other six instance will have inserted an importer with different class.
Therefore, we only CSRF protect the internal implementation.
These URLs *should* still pass the security check
These additional inputs are used for dependency tracking purposes.
These are 'functional' level tests for common use cases.
These are all valid strings The results are based on interpreting the identifier as a table name
These are always matched on separate lines.
These are assumed to be encoded using UTF-8.
These are both reset in __init__, but is specified here at the class level so that unpickling will have valid values

These are lists that will be treated as exclude lists and regular expression-based exclude/include lists.
These are m3u8 playlists
These are mapped to the pseudo-product type com.googlecode.gyp.xcode.bundle.
These are matched separately because operator names cross non-word boundaries.
These are mostly intermediate files for the build system.
These are not replaceable with CHECK_LE, so bail out early.
These are only designed to work for gcc-4.8.1.
These are presently not optimized but could be in the future.
These are strings instead of unicode strings because that's what was used in the creation of this reporter (and we haven't refreshed the data from the database, which always returns unicode strings).
These are tests for #16715.
These are the points that are components of the aggregate geographic union that is returned.
These are the same variable names that Xcode uses for its own native rule support.
These are things inside of an inventory basedir
These are used to construct the Content-Type header.
These are valid but maybe not what the user intended
These assignments are OK -- None is allowed because it's equivalent to the NULL pointer.
These can be different fields because model inheritance allows single model to have effectively multiple primary keys.
These can be overridden in settings (see `read_settings`).
These can be specified in means beyond what argparse supports, so we gather them in a list and parse them manually.
These can be valid for both frameworks and static libraries.
These cannot run on non-Windows as they require a VS installation to correctly handle variable expansion.
These characters can be put into the argument value by variable substitution."
These cities should be strictly to the right of the CO border.
These cities should be strictly to the right of the KS border.
These classes override date and datetime to support the formatting of a date through its full "proleptic Gregorian" date range.
These clowns alternate between two page types
These columns never go to any model.
These constants define the current inline assembly state
These constants define types of headers for use with _IncludeState.CheckNextIncludeOrder().
These deletes should be 'harmless' since they are done on child geometries
These entries are in the format: (path, url_name, app_name, namespace, view_name, func, args, kwargs) Simple case
These fields hold the id of the video
These files contain a main function with simple arguments parsing, time measurement utilities and a loop in which the bench-functions are called.
These flags are common for all extensions and provide loader and main function.
These flags reflect the compilation options used by xcode to compile extensions.
These following 4 models represent a far more complex ordering case.
These functions aren't actually called until they are attached to a GEOS context handle -- this actually occurs in geos/prototypes/threadsafe.py.
These groups should appear in the listed order.
These individual widgets can accept extra attributes if manually rendered.
These lines are copied from Lib/site.py on Python 3.4.
These mappings are contained in the class' _encode_transforms list.
These methods are part of the public API, with default implementations.
These methods are responsible for using the given templar to template the values, if required.
These methods partially implement a stream-like object interface.
These methods partially implement the file-like object interface.
These module-level routines return the I/O object that is local to the thread.
These must be set up here instead of in fixtures in order to allow Picture to use a NamedTemporaryFile.
These must happen before we compile any sources, so compute a list of predependencies for sources while we do it.
These next models test the creation (or not) of many to many join tables between managed and unmanaged models.
These options could affect the commands that are available, so they must be processed early.
These parameters are passed in order (as opposed to by key) because ActivePython cannot handle key parameters to __import__.
These pass with a proper proxy setup, which our build machines don't seem to have.
These per-process dictionaries are used to cache build file data when loading in parallel mode.
These plugins are called directly by action plugins (not going through a strategy).
These queries combine results from the m2m and the m2o relationships.
These relationships should not exist, but they've only been observed to be harmful with the Xcode generator.
These semicolons seems far more common than other kinds of redundant semicolons, possibly due to people converting classes to namespaces.
These shouldn't be overridden by subclasses unless absolutely necessary.
These symbols used to be in django/core/mail.py before the introduction of email backends and the subsequent reorganization (See #10355)
These talk to the live daemons on the system.
These targets really should just add a product_name setting that doesn't include the prefix.
These tests use assert with a string argument, which is also basically eval.
These tests use create_function, which is basically eval.
These tests use eval(), which is banned in repo mode.
These track each time a Field instance is created.
These two addresses are the same with different syntax
These two are different, because we are not doing IPv4 unpacking
These two are the same, because we are doing IPv4 unpacking
These two classes are used to test auto-escaping of unicode output.
These two dates fall in the same day in EAT, but in different days, years and months in UTC.
These validators can't be added at field initialization time since they're based on values retrieved from `connection`.
These values, if given to validate(), will trigger the self.required check.
These variables are described at https://www.serfdom.io/docs/commands/members.html#_rpc_addr
These variables should just be spit back out as variable references.
These weren't in the cache, or the DB, create them.
These will be found by meta.get_fields()
These will load using the 'default' database identifier explicitly
These will load using the 'default' database identifier implicitly
They affect the size of the lookup tables (and thus, lookup time), but do not change the overall structure of the trie.
They are copied after the builtin static files, so a file named "default.css" will overwrite the builtin "default.css".
They are ignored by default.
They are meaningless for type mh_bundle.
They are overridden on each GoogleMap instance in the set so that only the loading JavaScript (and not the header variables) is used with the generated DOM ids.
They can be extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom ones.
They contain the message and action to perform after resolving input-dependent variables.
They differ only slightly: In the former case, we want to package all dependent code into the .so.
They get broken link notifications and other various emails.
They get matched as: -exported_symbols_list file -Wl,exported_symbols_list file -Wl,exported_symbols_list,file
They must go to the beginning of the list so that the dependency generation works as expected in ninja.
They refer to existing columns on a row, but in the case of insert the row doesn't exist yet.
They should generate the "right thing" whether we have specified a custom form, the fields argument, or nothing at all.
They were taken from the Python3 standard library and adapted for use in Python2.
They will be fully expanded by recursion in ExpandVariables.
They're algorithmic so good candidates for unittesting by themselves
They're displayed in the last row of the form, directly after that row's form element.
They're implemented on demand.
They're populated with content from Monty Python and the Holy Grail.
They're pretty large, so don't hog disk space.
They're products, not sources.
They're the same, no more caching.
They're three ways of saying the same thing.
Things that look like escaped characters shouldn't occur outside of strings and chars.
Things without _meta aren't functional models, so they're uninteresting parents.
Third argument, if non-zero, makes it do POSTBUILDS processing.
Third tuple is the start and end indexes of the last page.
Third-party backends can be specified by providing a Python path to a module that defines an EmailBackend class.
Thirty-two bit floating point
Thirty-two bit signed integer
Thirty-two bit unsigned integer
This (target include directories) is what requires CMake 2.8.8
This AST node is only formed if full location information is requested.
This DataSource object is not accessible outside this scope.
This Experiment is only included in the test data when the DB supports microsecond precision.
This LayerMapping should work b/c `strict` is not set.
This Price instance generated by this form is not valid because the quantity field is required, but the form is valid because the field is excluded from the form.
This RE is a little bit more complicated than one might expect, because we have to take care of space removals tools so we can handle comments inside statements better.
This URLs file is used to provide a reliable view deployment for test purposes.
This a short id that's used in the webpage urls
This adds time to parsing but speeds up code completion.
This algorithm can only handle fully exploded IP strings
This allows all the other paths we use to be relative to the Android.mk file, as the Android build system expects.
This allows for correct identification (later) of the actual template that does not exist.
This allows for correct identification of the actual template that does not exist.
This allows for more complex queries than filter() and exclude() alone would allow
This allows for proper grouping.
This allows idempotence of command executions.
This allows individual applications to respond as if the database had been migrated from scratch.
This allows operations to be done on fields in the SELECT, overriding their values -- used by the Oracle and MySQL spatial backends to get database values as WKT, and by the `transform` method.
This allows overriding everything if need be.
This allows people to easily run their modified code on the remote machine to see how changes will affect it.
This allows self.__repr__ to be explicit about it instead of simply representing an empty POST
This allows us to avoid the need to do two passes during linking.
This allows us to check for any hard references to the name "User" in forms/handlers etc.
This allows us to handle quotes properly as long as we always use use single quotes and escape_quotes.
This also works if you assign the FK in the constructor
This also works if you assign the O2O relation in the constructor
This app isn't migrated, but something depends on it.
This argument is passed when run from the gclient hooks.
This argument is used to establish that the BookManager is actually getting used when it should be.
This arrangement means that a "conditions" section containing a "variables" section will only have those variables effective in subdicts, not in the_dict.
This attack is based on the way browsers handle URLs.
This attempts to run the module in-process (by importing a main function and then calling it).
This automatically behaves like an OR evaluation of the multiple variables.
This avoids these false positives: - macro that defines a base class - multi-line macro that defines a base class - macro that defines the whole class-head
This backend doesn't accept these credentials as arguments.
This backend says to stop in our tracks - this user should not be allowed in at all.
This backend was renamed in Django 1.9.
This bailout is still needed for skipping signal sending.
This behavior is only activated during a raw save - it is mostly relevant to deserialization, but any sort of CORBA style 'narrow()' API would require a similar approach.
This behavior was changed from max_num taking precedence in the patch for #20084
This benefits both the "build chrome" case as well as the gyp tests, which expect to be able to run actions and build libraries by their short name.
This block sends information about a playbook when it starts The playbook object is not immediately available at playbook_on_start so we grab it via the play
This breaks incremental linking, and is generally overly complicated.
This bypasses any model-defined save.
This cache also might not exist if the related object hasn't been accessed yet.
This cache exists so that the database isn't queried for SRID info each time a distance query is constructed.
This caches the preamble (included files at top of source file).
This callback is an example of per hosts logging for those that want it.
This can also crop up outside of tests - see #15346.
This can be an ISBN number or the project homepage.
This can be removed if shutil.which() is backported, or if the Swift build toolchain migrates completely to Python 3.3+.
This can be understood through the POSTGIS_HEADER_STRUCTURE constant definition in the const module.
This can be whatever you want.
This can cause issues where files that were deleted from a more recent Django are still present in site-packages.
This can cause problems (see #25389).
This can go away when we add verification that all targets have the necessary configurations.
This can happen if six is removed from sys.modules and then reloaded.
This can happen in the as_p() case (and possibly others that users write): if there are only top errors, we may not be able to conscript the last row for our purposes, so insert a new, empty row.
This can happen two ways: - We are at the beginning of the class.
This can happen when we're just evaluating the playlist
This can only be the end of a non-capturing group, since all other unescaped parentheses are handled by the grouping section later (and the full group is handled there).
This case used to fail because the ORM couldn't resolve the automatically generated annotation name `book__count`
This causes actions/rules invoked by gyp to sometimes use these instead of system versions, e.g. bison.
This causes an infinite loop under MySQL InnoDB unless we keep track of already deleted objects.
This check duplicates that behavior.
This check is kept for backwards-compatibility.
This check is performed only once per DatabaseWrapper instance per thread, since subsequent connections will use the same settings.
This check needs to be done here, since we can't later remove this from the method lookup table, as we do with add and remove.
This checks if promotion of join types works for deeper nesting too.
This checks that get_prep_value is deferred properly
This class (Form) is the one that does the fancy metaclass stuff purely for the semantic sugar -- it allows one to define a form using declarative syntax.
This class didn't have any class_lookups
This class ensures managers aren't accessible via model instances.
This class is a subclass of ChoiceField for purity, but it doesn't actually use any of ChoiceField's implementation.
This class manages Nuclide servers.
This class provides a better error message when you try to access a manager on a swapped model.
This class provides a better error message when you try to access a manager on an abstract model.
This class represents a Nuclide server process on a port.
This class uses cursors provided by the database connection.
This cleanup is necessary because contrib.sites cache makes tests interfere with each other, see #11505
This code checks if value maches the IP version the user wants, ie.
This code is at the end of this module to speed up module loading.
This code is part of Ansible, but is an independent component.
This coding header is significant for tests, as the debug view is parsing files to search for such a header to decode the source file content
This combination actually never happens.
This combines the Extent and Union aggregates into one query
This comes from FloatField columns.
This comes from IntField and DecimalField columns.
This comment is here just to include a ' to unconfuse syntax highlighting.
This comment should not be extracted
This conditional and conversion exists to sanity check the values we're given but we may want to take it out for testing and sanitize our input instead.
This construct is somewhat of an abuse of ForeignObject.
This construct might look complicated but it allows for lazy evaluation of the queryset.
This context manager helps us avoid that situation.
This converts json strings to dictionaries, which are parsed below the same way as direct dictionary inputs.
This could be further improved by inspecting the java file for the package name if this proves to be too fragile in practice.
This could be optimized with a cache at the expense of RAM.
This creates an interface with the same name as a builtin, which hphpc doesn't correctly support AttrUnique flags on.
This custom encoder looks for instances of NoIndent or ChunkedIndent.
This defaults to 'epub', a theme designed to save visual space.
This delays the instantiation of the objects to the moment of evaluation of the raster attribute.
This deletes the existing categories.
This depends on both the removal/alteration of all incoming fields and the removal of all its own related fields, and if it's a through model the field that references it.
This designates the field indexes (1-based) of the fields that have indexes on the table.
This dict stores the download progress, it's updated by the progress hook
This dictionary maps Field objects to their associated MySQL column types, as strings.
This dictionary maps Field objects to their associated Oracle column types, as strings.
This dictionary maps Field objects to their associated PostgreSQL column types, as strings.
This dictionary will eventually contain the request's query string parameters actually used by this filter.
This differs slightly from default Ansible execution of Python modules as it passes the arguments to the module via a file instead of stdin.
This does not apply when the non-space character following the comma is another comma, since the only time when that happens is for empty macro arguments.
This does not inherit from TestCase to avoid any tests being run with this class, which wouldn't work, and to allow different TestCase subclasses to be used.
This does not match the characters in _escape, because those need to be backslash-escaped regardless of whether they appear in a double-quoted string.
This does not seem to be any help here global_settings.GetDefaultCamera()
This does not stop existing Nuclide server processes themselves.
This does not use has/getattr intentionally - we want to know whether we have cached the regexp for *this* class, whereas getattr would also match the superclass
This doesn't account for template loaders (#24128).
This doesn't account for the database connection's timezone, which isn't known.
This doesn't catch all cases.
This doesn't handle non-default expiry dates, see #19201
This doesn't integrate well with the test suite but at least it prevents regressions.
This doesn't make a copy when `value` already contains bytes.
This doesn't require running on PostgreSQL and spots the most likely error - not running YearLte SQL at all.
This doesn't support per-configuration prefix headers.
This doesn't work before django.setup() on some databases.
This dollar is ok as it is escaped
This ensures that the earliest occurrence of the item will stay put.
This ensures that the item appears at the earliest possible position in the list.
This ensures we don't get flooded with messages during testing (unless you really ask to be flooded).
This example is tricky because the parent could be NULL, so only checking parents with annotations omits some results (tag t1, in this case).
This exercises that case.
This extra absorption in the regexp facilitates testing the regexp on its own, by preventing the interior of some of these constructs from being treated as literal text.
This extra legwork is so that the dictionary definition comes out in the same order as the fields in the model definition.
This fails if not using the highest pickling protocol on Python 2.
This field clashes with parent "f_id" field.
This field doesn't result in a clash.
This field is a m2m relation so we know we need to call distinct
This field is a relation, update opts to follow the relation
This field is intentionally 2 characters long (#16080).
This field name is intentionally 2 characters long (#16080).

This file should be a Windows icon file (.ico) being 16x16 or 32x32 pixels large.
This final query should only have seven tables (port, device and building twice each, plus connection once).
This flag will be set to True again if there isn't a savepoint allowing to perform the rollback at this level.
This form is going to be deleted so any of its errors should not cause the entire formset to be invalid.
This form should print errors the default way.
This fun binary flag incantation makes os.open throw an OSError if the file already exists before we open it.
This function exists for consistency with get_current_timezone_name
This function is called a lot so for maximum performance, avoid involving regexps which would otherwise make the code much shorter.
This function is considered a friend of XcodeSettings, so let it reach into its implementation details.
This function is only needed to help with the deprecations above and can be removed in Django 2.0, RemovedInDjango20Warning.
This function is only useful to get children that have names but no paths, which is rare.
This function might benefit from a dict optimization as GetChildByPath for some workloads, but profiling shows that it's not currently a problem.
This function ported from the logic in Homebrew's CLT version check
This function resolves a target into a canonical form: - a fully defined build file, either absolute or relative to the current directory - a target name - a toolset
This function should be used only to compare direct children of the containing PBXProject's mainGroup.
This function works closely with _EncodeString.
This functions (and the similar ones below) do not offer complete emulation of all xcode_settings keys.
This generates makefiles suitable for inclusion into the Android build system via an Android.mk file.
This geographic field is inherited from another model, so we have to use the db table for the _parent_ model instead.
This gets expanded by Python.
This gets serialized and sent back to the main process via a pipe.
This gets the information to check whether the name field contains a template that we can squash for
This global object represents the default admin site, for the common case.
This guarantees that no records are skipped or duplicated.
This hack is necessary because the template engine doesn't provide a context-aware equivalent of Python's getattr.
This hack is to work around readline issues on a mac: http://stackoverflow.com/a/7116997/541202
This handler returns one of several different documents, depending on the query string.
This handles 'throw' and 'throw' assignment-expression.
This happens in admin's changeform_view() when adding a new object and some inlines in the same request.
This happens in the case of the root PBXGroup.
This happens to be easier in this case, since a variable's definition contains all variables it references in a single string.
This happens when calling quit() on a TLS connection sometimes, or when the connection was already disconnected by the server.
This happens when the SDK is sync'd via src-internal, rather than by typical end-user installation of the SDK.
This has bitten us in the past.
This helper function is used to allow recursion in ``get_fields()`` implementation and to provide a fast way for Django's internals to access specific subsets of fields.
This helper used too early for fail_json to work.
This ignores whitespace at the start of a namespace block because those are not usually indented.
This import does nothing, but it's necessary to avoid some race conditions in the threading module.
This includes checking that they are the same type
This includes sources as well as the starting directory a given gyp rule/action expects to be run from.
This initial data is displayed when a Form is rendered with *no* data.
This is 24h before max Unix time.
This is True for all core backends.
This is a 6 character identifier provided with each message This makes it easier to correlate messages when there are more than 1 simultaneous playbooks running
This is a ValueError for python-memcache, pylibmc.NotFound for pylibmc, and cmemcache will return None without raising an exception.
This is a bit of a hack, but it seems hard to test this properly otherwise.
This is a bit ugly, but it avoids running this again by removing this descriptor.
This is a custom FieldListFilter class for a given field.
This is a file, use the handler...
This is a for-else: http://bit.ly/1ElPkyg Use Windows version of ping module to check module paths when using a connection that supports .ps1 suffixes.
This is a hook for data_types_reverse to return a tuple of (field_type, field_params_dict).
This is a list of all standard c++ header files, except those already checked for above.
This is a low-prioroty problem and is not a show-stopper.
This is a minimal valid WSGI environ dictionary, plus: - HTTP_COOKIE: for cookie support, - REMOTE_ADDR: often useful, see #8551.
This is a normal uploadedfile that we can stream.
This is a post field, we can just set it in the post
This is a separate class from BaseForm in order to abstract the way self.fields is specified.
This is a separate method, rather than just a copy of has_key(), so that it always has the same functionality as has_key(), even if a subclass overrides it.
This is a special case for databases which limit the number of elements which can appear in an 'IN' clause.
This is a test setup, not a requirement for unmanaged models.
This is about *rsync's connection*, not about the ansible connection to run the module.
This is actually the quoting rules for CommandLineToArgvW, not for the shell, because the shell doesn't do anything in Windows.
This is all roughly based on the Makefile system used by the Linux kernel, but is a non-recursive make -- we put the entire dependency graph in front of make and let it figure it out.
This is also a good select_related() test because there are multiple Note entries in the SQL.
This is also needed in order to create the connection in order to install the hstore extension.
This is also used in the base class for strategies (ansible/plugins/strategy/__init__.py)
This is always a valid order_by field but is an alias and therefore won't be found by opts.get_field.
This is always executed on a query clone, so we can modify self.query
This is an action that doesn't make any sense.
This is an easy way for people to look at the code on the remote machine for debugging it in that environment
This is an example of a model that imports a class that has an abstract base class.
This is an expression, let's compile it.
This is an inherited model from City
This is an optgroup, so look inside the group for options
This is an optgroup, so look inside the group for options.
This is because `QuerySet.all()` works by creating a "copy" of the current queryset and in making said copy, all the cached `prefetch_related` lookups are lost.
This is because instances on ForeignObject properties will set all related field off of the given instance
This is because powershell only works on windows but the other modules work anywhere (possibly including windows if the correct language interpreter is installed).
This is because the Android LOCAL_GENERATED_SOURCES must be in the local module intermediate directory for the compile rules to work properly.
This is because the downside for getting the whitelist wrong means some extra semicolons, while the downside for getting the blacklist wrong would result in compile errors.
This is because we use system to create tmp dirs for unprivileged users who are sudo'ing to a second unprivileged user.
This is called by three functions: __init__.py::_do_handler_run(), linear.py::run(), and free.py::run() so we'd have to add to all three to do it there.
This is compatible with other
This is complex because daemonization is hard for people.
This is considered acceptable since we want the value in the form field (to pass into widget for example).
This is consulted in case multiple AnsibleModules are created.
This is currently useless as we only get here if we are going to substitute powershell.ps1 into the module anyway.
This is dangerous -- casts can assign to temporaries, so the pointer doesn't point where you think.
This is dangerous because the C++ language does not guarantee that globals with constructors are initialized before the first access.
This is default behavior.
This is defined here as a do-nothing function because we can't import django.utils.translation -- that module depends on the settings.
This is done after variable expansion so that conditions may take advantage of expanded variables.
This is done as a check when get_host() is invoked, but we check here as a practical consequence.
This is done as a property to ensure that the fully resolved value is returned.
This is done by identifying all tables that have their primary key included in the grouped columns and removing non-primary key columns referring to them.
This is done by repeatedly iterating over the input list of models.
This is done here, rather than on the field, because the field does not have access to the initial value
This is done in a separate loop up front, because the _included and _excluded keys need to be added to the_dict, and that can't be done while iterating through it.
This is done in order to keep the scene output and non-scene output code DRY
This is done to avoid some false positives with shifts.
This is done to ensure that for Python2 only, defining metaclasses still does not fail to create the model.
This is done to make it easy to build source paths.
This is done to more closely match the depth-first method used by DeepDependencies.
This is done with an exception rather than the default argument on pop because we don't want get_default() to be evaluated, and then not used.
This is executed in autocommit mode so that code in run_select_for_update can see this data.
This is expected to fail because the savepoint no longer exists.
This is falling back to the default value exposed by python-memcached on my system.
This is filed as Apple radar 6588391.
This is for backwards compat.
This is for backwards compatibility.
This is for backwards-compatibility: RequestContexts created via Context.new don't include values from context processors.
This is for efficiency and scripts should still return data if called with --host for backwards compat with 1.2 and earlier.
This is handled transparently, though.
This is hard because User defines equality in a non-duck-typing way See bug #12060
This is how the admin system's edit inline functionality works.
This is how you are officially supposed to set SO_REUSEADDR per https://docs.python.org/2/library/socketserver.html#SocketServer.BaseServer.allow_reuse_address
This is important because paths will be used as keys to the data dict and for references between input files.
This is important to make pages cacheable.
This is in-place sorting of an Options attribute, but that's fine.
This is intended for executable, shared_library and loadable_module targets where every configuration is set up to produce a PDB output.
This is intended to be used very sparingly.
This is intentional, as we do not want to block autocomplete.
This is interpolated into the hostname pattern below.
This is just an app - no model qualifier
This is just an example for testing purposes...
This is just here to clarify.
This is kind of optimization - if user told us destination is dir, do path manipulation right away, otherwise we still check for dest being a dir via remote call below.
This is mainly only useful for ad-hoc command line operation as in playbooks one would assume variables would be used appropriately
This is meant to be used with smoothing layer elements.
This is meant to silence warnings for conditional includes.
This is necessary as someone may be using PSQL without extensions installed but be using other features of contrib.postgres.
This is necessary as the other dependencies on them may be static libraries themselves, which are not compile time dependencies.
This is necessary as the shareability is disabled by default in pysqlite and it cannot be changed once a connection is opened.
This is necessary because the tag lets the length of loopvars differ to the length of each set of items and we don't want to leave any vars from the previous loop on the context.
This is needed because bisect does not take a comparison function.
This is needed on the Ansible control machine to be reasonably efficient with connections.
This is needed to cut chunks of band data out of PostGIS raster strings when decomposing them into GDALRasters.
This is non-reversible, but we shouldn't blow up when parsing it.
This is not a complete expression and cannot be used in GROUP BY.
This is not a fast-delete problem.
This is not a real id, it can be for example AJT for the news http://www.arte.tv/guide/fr/emissions/AJT/arte-journal
This is not a relational field, so further parts must be transforms.
This is not a url() instance
This is not clearly defined otherwise
This is not currently optimized with a dict as GetChildByPath is because it has few callers.
This is not expected to be much of a problem in practice.
This is not infinite-recursion proof.
This is not quite right, as it also protects these for actions, not just for rules where they are valid.
This is not true for static libraries, but currently the env is only written for bundles:
This is not wanted behavior, but this is how Django has always behaved for databases that do not return correct information about matched rows for UPDATE.
This is only an issue if it contains unescaped non-ASCII characters, which URIs should not.
This is only available when using MySQL 5.6, or when using MyISAM tables.
This is only non-None temporarily during the execution of some methods.
This is only triggered if both sides are missing spaces, even though technically should flag if at least one side is missing a space.
This is only useful for tests
This is order preserving, since self.extra_select is an OrderedDict.
This is part of rtmpdump's normal usage, AFAIK.
This is probably due to YouTube measures against IP ranges of hosting providers.
This is really ESRI format, not WKT -- but the import should work the same
This is required as a workaround for an  edge case in MySQL: if the same connection is used to create tables, load data, and query, the query can return incorrect results.
This is required by GDAL.
This is required to ensure the value is tested for change correctly when determine what extra forms have changed to save.
This is safe to ignore.

This is set by --linelength flag.
This is set by --root flag.
This is simply YouTube

This is slightly complicated, so worth an explanation.
This is so the string pointer can be freed within Python.
This is something that could be fixed later on.
This is strictly unnecessary for correctness, it's only to verify that e.g. /MANIFESTDEPENDENCY was not used in a #pragma comment.
This is temporary workaround to reduce burst of bug reports until we figure out the reason and whether it can be fixed at all.
This is tested directly on _key_to_file, as load() will swallow a SuspiciousOperation in the same way as an IOError - by creating a new session, making it unclear whether the slashes were detected.
This is the base table (first FROM entry) - this table isn't really joined at all in the query, so we should not alter its join type.
This is the canonical way to emulate LIMIT and OFFSET on Oracle.
This is the default in SQLite but can be changed with a build flag and might change in future, so can't be relied upon.
This is the default value

This is the return type used by binary output (WKB, HEX) routines.
This is the same as "attname", except if db_column is specified.
This is the same as "name", except in the case of ForeignKeys, where "_id" is appended.
This is the same as in the default project template

This is the sort order used by Xcode.
This is the template used to generate the GMap load JavaScript for each map in the set.
This is the thread-local connection, not the main connection.
This is the websocket client that will actually talk with meteor
This is tightly coupled to the implementation, but it's the most straightforward way to test the key.
This is to allow overriding the default filters for certain types of fields with some custom filters.
This is to avoid adding struct arguments to the nesting stack.
This is to handle the case where the test DB doesn't exist, in which case we need to create it, then just not destroy it.
This is typically used when parsing headers.
This is ugly, and a hack, but it makes things better than the alternative of predictability.
This is used by external sites like Weibo
This is used for error messages if further parsing fails due to an unclosed block tag.
This is used in the admin for save_as functionality.
This is used to pack and unpack the pixel values of PostGIS raster bands.
This is useful if the translation unit will be reparsed and you don't want to incur the overhead of reparsing the preamble.
This is useful if you only care about searching for declarations/definitions.
This is useful if you want to factor out common information for programming purposes, but still completely independent separate models at the database level.
This is useful under some testing situations and should never be used on a live site.
This is very common for TV series.
This is what we keep after the #endif.
This is where we actually say we are starting a play
This is written in such a way that it'll always pass on platforms without threading.
This is wrong for Django websites where UTF-8 is the default.
This isn't a raw save because: 1) we're testing inheritance, not field behavior, so none of the field values need to be protected.
This isn't a real primary/replica database, so restore the original from other
This isn't necessary on Windows since the Windows version of abspath handles this correctly.
This isolates the decision of what the system default is, so calling code can do "feedgenerator.DefaultFeed" instead of "feedgenerator.Rss201rev2Feed".
This isolates the final return value so that it isn't misattributed to the last stage.
This issue can happen if the value of 'list_filter' refers to a 'through__field'.
This item matches an exclude regex, so set its value to 0 (exclude).
This item matches an include regex, so set its value to 1 (include).
This item matches the exclude_item, so set its action to 0 (exclude).
This just checks that the uploaded data is JSON
This keeps the file writer from outputting something that would be treated as the end of a comment in the middle of something intended to be entirely a comment.
This keeps the model field from raising a required error.
This lead to wrong sorting.
This leads to self being  placed in the arguments twice.
This lets us pop a frame at the top of the loop, which makes it easier to include the final frame.
This lets us skip creating migrations for the test models as many of them depend on one of the following contrib applications.
This lets us test changes in username datatype, and non-text required fields.
This letter is removed from the final output.
This light wrapper "fakes" a dictionary interface, because some SQLite data types include variables in them -- e.g. "varchar(30)" -- and can't be matched as a simple dictionary lookup.
This limit is defined by Google.
This line will raise an Exception if prompt contains unencoded non-ASCII on Python 2.
This list is expanded on demand.
This list is not exhaustive, but that's okay.
This loads the GDAL/OGR C library
This logic is added to the end of the cmd at the bottom of this function.
This logic is list-specific, but since it relies on the associated dict key, it's checked in this dict-oriented function.
This looks a little crazy, but it's the equivalent of what the admin interface has to do for the edit-inline case.
This makes it possible to have captured parameters in the parent URLconf pattern.
This makes life easier, and is probably required for backwards compatibility with external tests against admin views.
This makes the definition of 'results' more readable.

This maps field names (not columns) for things like unique_together
This matches a square-bracketed expression with a port specification.
This matches an IPv4 address, but also permits range expressions.
This matches an IPv6 address, but also permits range expressions.
This matches the requested mod_type
This may be done in gyp files to force certain includes to come at the end.
This may be unrecognized because it's an exclusion list.
This may change the properties of the chosen random sequence slightly, but this is better than absolute predictability.
This may happen when users put an IP entry into their inventory, or if they rely on DNS for a non-inventory hostname
This may not have been checked above if merging in a list with an extension character.
This may seem a little strange, but later we will show how to require a minimum number of forms to be completed.
This means it reads expiration values as aware or naive datetimes, depending on the value of USE_TZ and whether the database supports time zones.
This means not only that the linker should not generate the intermediate manifest but also that the manifest tool should do nothing even when additional manifests are specified.
This means shared_library uses --whole-archive, while loadable_module doesn't.
This means that a vertex will have as many mapping coordinates as polygons of which it is a part.
This means that all variables in .mk-files clobber one another, and furthermore that any variables set potentially clash with other Android build system variables.
This means that all variables in .mk-files clobber one another.
This means that if you have a classmethod and a field with the same name, then such fields can't be deferred (we don't have a check for this).
This means that one cannot add both "foo:22" and "foo:23" to the inventory.
This means that the _meta._relation_tree is only called if related_objects is not in __dict__.
This means that we have to switch to absolute timestamps.
This means the delimiter and the next list item that follow this one in the .vcproj file will be misinterpreted as part of this item.
This means we shouldn't continue...raise an error.
This means we will not check single-line class definitions.
This mess below finds the best xattr tool for the job and creates a "write_xattr" function.
This message is displayed at the top of the output, regardless of its field's order in the form.
This method can only be called once the result cache has been filled.
This method encapsulates the logic that decides what name to give an accessor descriptor that retrieves related many-to-one or many-to-many objects.
This method intentionally doesn't work for all cases - part of the test for ticket #20278
This method is a little bit esoteric.
This method is available for pytz time zones.
This method is called for each object in self.target.
This method is performance-critical at least for Django's test suite.
This method is run in a separate thread.

This method returns True if all configurations in target contain a 'SYMROOT' attribute that is unique for the given target.
This method should be named "as_mysql" for MySQL, "as_postgresql" for postgres and so on, but as we don't know which DB we are running on, we need to use setattr.
This method takes a field name and returns the prefixed field, according to self.prefix.
This might be a rel on the other end of an actual declared field.
This might fail one day due to a hash collision.
This might look crazy but due to how IN works, this seems to be correct.
This mimics Xcode behavior by wrapping the comment in "/*" and "*/".
This mishandles IPv6 addresses, and is retained only for backwards compatibility.
This model is used to test a duplicate query regression (#25685)
This model looks like the new model and is used for teardown.
This module always tracks it as an object, but contains a hack to prevent it from printing the comment in the project file output.
This moved 'mark' in the 'default' database, move it back in 'other'
This must be a TransactionTestCase because the WSGI auth handler performs its own transaction management.
This must check the unexpanded includes list:
This must come after 'select', 'ordering', and 'distinct' -- see docstring of get_from_clause() for details.
This must come before int because bools are also ints
This name gets put at the end of the template name list so that user-supplied names override the automatically- generated ones.
This necessarily pokes at the SQL string for the query, since the duplicate problems are only apparent at that late stage.
This needs to be overridden in child classes.
This normally comes from a mathematical expression in the SELECT list.
This object is now relative to that variable, so it has no path attribute of its own.
This object retains its existing id and parent attributes.
This object understands how to convert a path to a file, and also how to handle None.
This occurs when rule outputs from distinct inputs are interdependent.
This one is triggering http://bugs.python.org/issue20747, that is Python will itself insert a newline in the header
This one needs demotion logic: the first filter causes a to be outer joined, the second filter makes it inner join again.
This one only accepts pointers to floats
This one should wrap error groups in the customized way.
This only becomes a problem when the order_by introduces a new join.
This only matches constant *strings* (things in quotes or marked for translation).

This option is not thread safe.
This page will redirect with code 301, not 302
This pair of tests relies upon the alphabetical ordering of test execution.
This parameter is set by the handler.
This particularly prevents that an empty value is cached while cloning.
This pattern is used to determine when a string can be printed unquoted.
This pattern should match any character that needs to be escaped by XCObject._EncodeString.
This playlist contains some extra videos other than the drama itself
This port is already in use, so we go on and try with the next one in the list.
This prevents header-spoofing based on ambiguity between underscores and dashes both normalized to underscores in WSGI env vars.
This prevents the database from tripping over IN (...,NULL,...) selects and returning nothing
This prevents trying to do selections on an empty set.
This prevents unicode from getting mangled by getting encoded into the potentially non-unicode database character set.
This probably shouldn't happen, but it will.
This procedure needs to give the impression that target_defaults is used as defaults, and the individual targets inherit from that.
This process continues until the input list is empty, or we do a full iteration over the input models without promoting a model to the final list.
This project file isn't yet linked to the other one.
This proves clean() checks the database during clean() rather than caching it at time of instantiation.
This provides empty defaults to each key, so that environment variable configuration (as opposed to INI configuration) is able to work.
This python file contains utility scripts to manage Django translations.
This python script runs db_stress multiple times.
This query retrieves each index on the given table, including the first associated field name
This quick hack merges the dictionaries.
This re-seeds the PRNG using a value that is hard for an attacker to predict, every time a random string is required.
This recurses into condition entries since they can contain toolsets as well.
This recurses into lists so that it can look for dicts.
This reg-exp is intentionally fairly flexible here.
This regex validates that the string looks like a GUID with all uppercase hex letters.
This regular expression is used only if the user does not have GDAL installed.
This remove the ParamCoerceMode checks that is usually in the beginning of the tests.
This replaces the gyp_* variables for the action rule with an absolute version so that the output goes in the right place.
This replaces the obj variable for the action rule with an absolute version so that the output goes in the right place.
This replacing migration cannot be used because it is partially applied.
This represents the unary-expression's (except sizeof and alignof).
This request sets a session variable.
This requires a bit of explanation: the basic idea is to make a dummy metaclass for one level of class instantiation that replaces itself with the actual metaclass.
This requires input file cooperation and it means that process_outputs_as_sources is unusable.
This restriction should remain in place until it's possible to load multiple YAML records from a single file, or it's too easy to create an encrypted file that can't be read back in.
This returns a different result each time, to make sure it only gets called once.
This saves bandwidth but slows down performance.
This script can be run manually but is more often run as part of gclient hooks.
This script creates the .pak files under locales directory, it is used to fool the ResourcesBundle that the locale is available.
This script requires the ``keyring`` python module
This script runs and kills db_stress multiple times.
This script works by starting with the unity build file and recursively expanding include directives.
This seems an acceptable compromise considering `runserver` runs indefinitely.
This seems to be needed
This sends an email to the site admins on every HTTP 500 error.
This series is moved to http://www.le.com/tv/10005297.html
This setting ensures we always read result sets fully into memory all in one go.
This should also be in the standard library somewhere, and definitely isn't.
This should be a dictionary containing initial values for one or more fields in the form, keyed by field name.
This should be a string representing the name of the executable (e.g., "psql").
This should be called after all files have been transferred.
This should be deleted once Py2.7 is available on all bots, see http://crbug.com/241769.
This should be handled by mspdbsrv, but rarely errors out with c1xx : fatal error C1033: cannot open program database By making the rules target separate pdb files this might be avoided.
This should be in the standard library somewhere, but as far as I can tell, it isn't.
This should be irrelevant, but some targets extract .o files from .a and depend on the name of the extracted .o files.
This should be registered last, because it's a last resort.
This should call a generator-provided function that observes the proper list-to-argument quoting rules on a specific platform instead of just calling the POSIX encoding routine.
This should delete both Restaurants, plus the related places, plus the ItalianRestaurant.
This should go into the build tree, but it's easier to keep it here for now.
This should instead use the correct API to determine the ID dynamically.
This should match the numerical portion of the version numbers (we can treat versions like 5.0.24 and 5.0.24a as the same).
This should never happen.
This should never receive unrendered content.
This should not actually do anything.
This should not crash.
This should not raise a validation error
This should not raise an exception.

This significantly reduces the amount of time required for creating complicated FileCheck Tests.
This similar to what an attacker would need to do when trying such an attack.
This simplifies manual builds of the target, and is required by the test framework.
This simulates primary/replica - the objects exist on both database, but the _state.db is as it is for all other tests.
This simulates what a template tag might do with the user from the context.
This slightly horrific process is so people who are testing on databases without transactions or who are using a TransactionTestCase still get a clean database on every test run.
This slightly odd comparison works around the fact that PostgreSQL will return 'one' and 'two' as strings, not Unicode objects.
This source file is part of the Swift.org open source project
This special case is considered in _check_id_field and here we ignore it.
This specifically tests that #6302 is fixed for both file fields and image fields.
This state is specific to certain functions and should be isolated there.
This string is intentionally duplicated in test.html
This structure allows a fairly standard loop do the normal printing.
This takes into account the situation where the lookup is a lookup to a related geographic field, e.g., 'address__point'.
This task will be skipped later due to this, so we just setup a dummy array for the later code so it doesn't fail
This technique is more accurate.
This terminology ("main value" and "dictionary of parameters") is from the Python docs.
This test assumes that PostgreSQL is configured with the default isolation level.
This test assumes there won't be a Django translation to a US variation of the Spanish language, a safe assumption.
This test creates two dummy

This test failed in #16715 because in some cases INNER JOIN was selected for the second foreign key relation instead of LEFT OUTER JOIN.
This test is executed after the previous one
This test needs to run outside of a transaction, otherwise closing the connection would implicitly rollback and cause problems during teardown.

This triggers a full clean.
This tuple came from calling `City.objects.aggregate(Extent())` -- we can't do that call here because `Extent` is not implemented for MySQL/Oracle.
This type of renditions are served through akamaihd.net, but they don't use f4m manifests
This typically indicates that I/O failed during save.
This unusual grouping/force_grouping combination may be triggered by the intcomma filter (#17414)
This use-case is useful for REPL.
This uses printf instead of echo because printf's behaviour with respect to escape sequences is more portable than echo's across different shells (e.g., dash, bash).
This validation should not be applied to MSVC2010 and later.
This value in the session is always serialized to a string, so we need to convert it back to Python whenever we access it.
This value is *not* used as a fallback if data isn't given.
This value must be unique across a Django project.
This value will be converted to unicode and stored in the database, so leaving False as-is is not acceptable.

This will be deprecated.
This will be overridden below if the failed_when property is set
This will be read by link.exe to know which instance of mspdbsrv.exe it should connect to (if it's not set then the default endpoint is used).
This will be relevant when both decorator and middleware are used.
This will be the case if it's an m2m using an autogenerated intermediate table (see BaseDatabaseIntrospection.sequence_list)
This will be the key as used in the request.META dictionary, i.e. the normalization of headers to all uppercase and the addition of "HTTP_" prefix apply.

This will make auto-reloader faster and will prevent the need to kill the server manually if a thread isn't terminating correctly.
This will never be a valid encoded hash

This will not save the file again, but leave it exactly as it is.
This will not save the image again, but leave it exactly as it is.
This will only work if our SSH user has root privileges, but since we can't reliably determine that from the username (think "toor" on FreeBSD), let's just try first and apologize later:
This will overflow the cache, causing a cull.
This will purge the relation tree and the fields cache.
This will put a 14-digit base36 timestamp into the token, which is too large.

This won't work during DST change, but we can't do much about it, so we let the exceptions percolate up the call stack.
This won't work on Powershell as-is, so we'll just completely skip until we have a need for it, at which point we'll have to do something different.
This won't, however, break any of the admin widgets or media.
This works around actions/rules which have more inputs than will fit on the command line.
This works as many levels deep as you want.
This works more or less because most programs (including the compiler, etc.) use that function to handle command line arguments.
This would be bad if we didn't catch the infinite loop.
This would fail with "TypeError: can't pickle instancemethod objects", only on Python 2.X.
This would fail with "TypeError: expected string or Unicode object, NoneType found".

Thus paramiko is faster for most users on these platforms.
Thus we end up with pickle thinking, in effect, that we are a distinct object from the wrapped object, but with the same __dict__.
Thus we must manually add the column to the inner query.
Thus, 6 joins plus the FROM table.
Thus, all of the various islands in Honolulu county will be in in one database record with a MULTIPOLYGON type.
Thus, collapse it into a list so it can be consumed more than once.

Thus, this slightly more restricted function, used by QueryDict.
Thus, we wrap any other type of File inside a FieldFile (well, the field's attr_class, which is usually FieldFile).

Tilde is part of RFC3986 Unreserved Characters http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.3 See also http://bugs.python.org/issue16285
TimeField are stored as TIMESTAMP with a 1900-01-01 date part.
Timeout value for 'default' cache, i.e. 30
TimestampSigner.unsign always returns unicode but base64 and zlib compression operate on bytes.
Timezone selection functions.
Titles should be double escaped by default (see #6533)
To achieve this in memcache backends, a negative timeout must be passed.
To achieve this we limit data_len to _TEST_FILE_SIZE and manually control block size when downloading a file.
To add entropy the hashable is enhanced with the names of all its children.
To add some, combine this with SeparateDatabaseAndState.
To allow for inheritance, check parent class' class_lookups.
To allow the widget to change the queryset of field1.widget.choices correctly, without affecting other forms, the following must hold:
To avoid "database is being accessed by other users" errors.
To avoid a circular reference the hashables used to compute a child id do not include the child names.
To avoid a constraint error, delete the entry before constraints are checked after the test.
To avoid dict-ordering related errors check only one lookup in single assert.
To avoid returning an instance of a subclass, this function returns `bytes(value)`.
To avoid reusing another user's session, create a new, empty session if the existing session corresponds to a different authenticated user.
To avoid the name collision, we use different names.
To avoid the problem entirely, we disallow users from adding users if they don't have change permission.
To avoid the problem, put in a quick sleep, which guarantees that there will be a time difference.
To avoid this problem, we mark the models as unmanaged, and temporarily revert them to managed during each test.
To avoid unnecessary changes to the project file after Xcode opens it, don't write comments for remoteGlobalIDString.
To avoid unnecessary persistent storage accesses, we set up the internals directly (loading data wastes time, since we are going to set it to an empty dict anyway).
To be threadsafe, updates/inserts are allowed to fail silently
To check the memcached backend, the test settings file will need to contain at least one cache backend setting that points at your memcache server.
To deal with that we make the property name field the first positional argument and self the second arg.
To delete something, we just need to set that form's special delete field to 'on'.
To do so, pass a extra argument to formset_factory.
To do this, just build up a new list of products based on the targets.
To ensure that Nuclide is easy to set up and install, we want to limit our dependencies to built-in Python libraries and libclang (which is provided in ../pythonpath)
To fix 'item in perms.someapp' and __getitem__ interaction we need to define __iter__.
To get serial runs this little bit of python does the same as the linux flock utility to make sure only one runs at a time.
To handle various inheritance situations, we need to track where managers came from (concrete or abstract base classes).
To help speed things up, pass -j COUNT to make so it does some work in parallel.
To keep rendering order consistent, we can't just iterate over items().
To keep track on which directories the finder has searched the static files.
To make sure this doesn't happen, get a clean connection at the start of every test.
To make them initially mismatch.
To make things more interesting, we will have our Texas reference point in different SRIDs.
To make things simple, right now we only read gcov report from the input
To preserve ordering of args
To prevent accidental data loss, ignore close requests on an in-memory db.
To prevent infinite recursion
To prevent overconsumption of server resources, reject any base36 string that is long than 13 base36 digits (13 digits is sufficient to base36-encode any 64-bit integer)
To prevent recalculating image dimensions when we are instantiating an object from the database (bug #11084), only update dimensions if the field had a value before this assignment.
To prevent this rule from executing on every build (expensive, especially with postbuilds), expliclity update the time on the framework directory.
To print out auto-adjustable column, we need to know the longest length of file names.
To properly test for the warning not happening unless we tell it to explicitly, we remove the project directory and will add back a conflicting file later.
To re-use the many-to-many intermediate table, we need to manually set up things up.
To replicate this issue, simulate the following steps: 1.
To save a formset as new, it needs a new hub instance
To set your password: python /path/to/vault-keyring.py set
To simplify development of Python modules, the functions available here can be used to do many common tasks
To simulate auto-incrementing primary keys in Oracle, we have to create a sequence and a trigger.
To somewhat reduce the probability of these consequences we will sleep random amount of time before each call to ViewClip.
To start, populate the migration graph with nodes for ALL migrations and their dependencies.
To support multiple relations to self, it's useful to have a non-None related name on symmetrical relations for internal reasons.
To test __search lookup a fulltext index is needed.

To test pickling we need a class that isn't defined on module, but is still available from app-cache.
To test, we want just one video
To transmit to the database, we need Unicode if supported To get size right, we must consider bytes.
To use fulltext indexes on MySQL either version 5.6 is needed, or one must use MyISAM tables.
To verify that the login form rejects inactive users, use an authentication backend that allows them.
To work around that bug, on SQLite, 'atomic' starts a transaction explicitly rather than simply disable autocommit.
To work around this the result of the `map` is explicitly converted to a `list`.
To work around this, if a target is building anything directly (not type "none"), then a second target is used to run the GYP actions/rules and is made a dependency of this target.
To work around, the type of the "target" property is reset below, after XCTarget is defined.
Tolerance has to be lower for Oracle
Too many params (4 in this case) should raise a ValueError.
Too much foreign keys to Person.

Using DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS isn't nice, but it is the best we can do here.
Using EWKT string parameter.
Using GEOSGeometry parameter
Using GEOSGeometry to compute the reference point on surface values -- since PostGIS also uses GEOS these should be the same.
Using OGRGeomType to convert from OGC name to Django field.
Using PHP7 versions of these tests
Using `field_name` keyword argument in one query and specifying an order in the other (which should not be used because this is an aggregate method on a spatial column)

Warp the raster into new srid
We (possibly) need to convert object IDs to the type of the instances' PK in order to match up instances:
We *could* pass in a queryset to restrict the Author objects we edit, but in this case we'll use it to display them in alphabetical order by name.
We actually allow both "foo" and "foo_id".
We add back in all of the non-compilable stuff to make sure that the make rules have dependencies on them.
We add csrf_protect here so this function can be used as a utility function for any view, without having to repeat 'csrf_protect'.
We add the group anyway, but make a note in pending_declarations to check at the end.
We added this journal field
We aim for a message size which will fit 4 messages into the cookie, but not 5.
We allow some, but not all, declarations of variables to be present in the statement that defines the class.
We also add "magic" variables back into the variables dict to make sure a certain subset of variables exist.
We also add some asserts to give better error messages in case people are using other ways to call cache_page that no longer work.
We also check "if" blocks here, since an empty conditional block is likely an error.
We also check for the case where the previous line is indented 6 spaces, which may happen when the initializers of a constructor do not fit into a 80 column line.
We also need to add special handling for SafeText and SafeBytes as MySQLdb's type checking is too tight to catch those (see Django ticket #6052).
We also need to move over any C++ files that don't match our local_cpp_extension, since Android will only generate Makefile rules for a single LOCAL_CPP_EXTENSION.
We also set the Territory to 'AMERICA' which forces Sunday to evaluate to a '1' in TO_CHAR().
We also set them to use the same tables as the "reference" models to avoid errors when other tests run 'migrate' (proxy_models_inheritance does).
We also want to prevent the add, change, and delete views from leaking a disallowed field value.
We always build CMake 2.8.8, so no need to do anything if the directory already exists.
We always get fresh droplets
We always want to ignore the environment when regenerating, to avoid duplicate or changed flags in the environment at the time of regeneration.

We are going to interpret the name as transform, and do an Exact lookup against it.
We are in a named backreference.
We are in a named capturing group.
We are not actually interested in it for normal cases, but need the cookies in order to be able to download the info webpage
We are probably not on PostgreSQL
We are seeing this user for the first time in this session, attempt to authenticate the user.
We are still keeping the less descriptive message because if lhs or rhs gets long, the error message might become unreadable.
We are testing if wrong objects get deleted due to using wrong field value in m2m queries.
We assume it is all in self.args.
We assume that objects retrieved are homogeneous (which is the premise of prefetch_related), so what applies to first object applies to all.
We avoid looking for values if either ct_id or fkey value is None
We borrow heavily from the kernel build setup, though we are simpler since we don't have Kconfig tweaking settings on us.
We build the url we will use to get the final track url This url is build in Bandcamp in the script download_bunde_*.js
We build up a list of every single one of the targets so we can slurp in the generated dependency rule Makefiles in one pass.
We cache this because we call this function multiple times (compiler.fill_related_selections, query.iterator)
We calculate state separately in here since our state functions aren't useful
We call private method that gives back all visible accessibility children for view
We call the path from the source root to the gyp file the "base directory" within the per-.gyp-file NinjaWriter code.
We can access its attributes as normal, and we don't have access to the dict that it returns when called.
We can accomplish this by using the empty_permitted argument to a form constructor.
We can accomplish this with form prefixes.
We can achieve the same thing by filtering for the case where the reporter is None.
We can also create a formset that is tied to a parent model.
We can also display more than 1 empty form passing min_num argument
We can also display more than 1 empty form passing min_num argument to formset_factory.
We can also do the above query using UTF-8 strings.
We can also increment through all of the fields attached to this feature.
We can also prefill a FormSet with existing data by providing an ``initial`` argument to the constructor.
We can also use the Article manager through an Author object.
We can build a direct link to the song
We can check whether the task is no_log but the argument spec can't be because that is only run on the target machine and we haven't run it thereyet at this time.
We can confirm that the doodad has been called
We can do this by passing the key_salt and our base key through a pseudo-random function and SHA1 works nicely.
We can end up here when saving a model in inheritance chain where update_fields doesn't target any field in current model.
We can even have proxies of proxies (and subclass of those).
We can filter on attribute relationships on same model obj, e.g. find companies where the number of employees is greater than the number of chairs.
We can grab them assuming bitrates to be default.
We can have one of action, local_action, or module specified action
We can just fill out one of the forms.
We can only have one '::' shortener.
We can only insert the line directive at a line break
We can perform arithmetic operations in expressions Make sure we have 2 spare chairs
We can perform kwarg queries across m2m relationships
We can provide a custom queryset to our InlineFormSet:
We can retrieve the answers related to a particular object, in the order they were created, once we have a particular object.
We can retrieve the ordering of the queryset from a particular item.
We can reuse self.children to append or squash the node other.
We can safely assume there is only one as we don't get to the direct value branch otherwise.
We can safely pop the build_file_data from per_process_data because it will never be referenced by this process again, so we don't need to keep it in the cache.
We can send it to the bottom using the last letter of the alphabet 'z'.
We can set one field to have the value of another field Make sure we have enough chairs
We can set the Django TZ to something else so that UTC, Django's TIME_ZONE, and the system timezone are all different.
We can set this from both an attribute and per call
We can simply ignore them since they're either empty line or doesn't find executable lines of the given file.
We can skip References to select clause, as all expressions in the select clause are already part of the group by.
We can squash the other node's children directly into this node.
We can still use `select_related()` to include related models in our querysets.
We can suppress output on the management command
We can then reverse the result of the topological sort at the end.
We can use .exists() to check that there are some
We can use the management command to create a superuser
We can use the management command to create a superuser We skip validation because the temporary substitution of the swappable User model messes with validation.
We can't access ``my_doodad.value`` in the template, because ``my_doodad.__call__`` will be invoked first, yielding a dictionary without a key ``value``.
We can't access `mcg' for whatever reason.
We can't ask the user, so act like the user aborted.
We can't ask the user, so set as not provided.
We can't assume much about the ID's created, except that the above created IDs must exist.
We can't be sure that these were actually Nuclide dumps, but they're temporary anyway.
We can't compare directly for NaN, since it is never equal to itself.
We can't compare results directly (since different databases sort NULLs to different ends of the ordering), but we can check that all results are returned.
We can't do the delete using subquery.
We can't do this for LEFT JOINs because we would miss those rows that have nothing on the outer side.
We can't just use lexicographic ordering in this check because then (1, 2, 1, 'gamma') inadvertently passes the version test.
We can't just use the project filename sans path, since there could be multiple projects with the same base name (for example, foo/unittest.vcproj and bar/unittest.vcproj).
We can't optimize across `other`.
We can't proxy this method through the `QuerySet` like we do for the rest of the `QuerySet` methods.
We can't rely on __mro__ directly because we only want to flatten abstract models and not the whole tree.
We can't rename it to include the browser name or create a subclass like we do with the remaining browsers as it would either duplicate tests or prevent pickling of its instances.
We can't reuse the same join again in the query.
We can't simply concatenate messages since they might require their associated parameters to be expressed correctly which is not something `string_concat` does.
We can't simply silence the warning on first sight of closing brace, because that would cause false negatives for things that are not initializer lists.
We can't simply unapply the migrations here because there is no implicit cast from VARCHAR to INT on the database level.
We can't test the DEFAULT_TABLESPACE and DEFAULT_INDEX_TABLESPACE settings because they're evaluated when the model class is defined.
We can't use displayname as it also includes the arguments.
We can't use is_secure() or get_host() because response.request is a dictionary, not an HttpRequest
We can't use strftime() because it produces locale-dependent results, so we have to map english month and day names manually
We cannot alter between m2m and concrete fields
We cannot reliably check this for backends like Oracle which consider NULL and '' to be equal (and thus set up character-based fields a little differently).
We cannot simply use assertRaises because a SkipTest exception will go unnoticed
We cannot synchronize the two threads with an event here because the main thread locks.
We capture the arguments to make returning them trivial
We categorize each error message we print.
We check for equality with a tolerance of 10e-5 which is a lower bound of the precisions of ref_line coordinates
We check here rather than inside ProcessLine so that we see raw lines rather than "cleaned" lines.
We check if a string was passed to `fields` or `exclude`, which is likely to be a mistake where the user typed ('foo') instead of ('foo',)
We check specifically for win_ping here, otherwise the code would look for ping.ps1
We check that all the formats have the format and format_id fields
We check to see if the options have the attribute, as it is not always added via the CLI
We classify each include statement as one of those 5 types using a number of techniques.
We connect receiver here and not in unit test code because we need to connect receiver before test runner creates database.
We constrain the pattern not to pick things like DocidForPrintf(foo).
We convert the audio (lossy)
We convert to a dict here.
We could do len(BLOCK_TAG_START) to be more "correct", but we've hard-coded the 2s here for performance.
We could end up here with NO_RECEIVERS even if we do check this case in .send() prior to calling _live_receivers() due to concurrent .send() call.
We could end up writing out parameters with unicode characters so we need to specify an encoding for the python source file
We could issue a warning here, but it probably resulted in a compiler error already.
We could optimize by only converting up to 4000 bytes here
We could skip this call if keepdb is True, but we instead give it the keepdb param.
We could try to override the global cache, but then people will still use direct imports, so we go with a documentation approach instead.
We could use perhaps additional logic here to see if some children could be used for pushdown here.
We could use some of these to add additional capabilities, I suppose, but they might not have parity with other platforms then.
We couldn't do this earlier, because settings weren't available.
We create a huge list of all the elements of the file.
We currently set the primary keys on the objects when using PostgreSQL via the RETURNING ID clause.
We defer variable evaluation to the lambda to ensure that terms are lazily evaluated using Python's boolean parsing logic.
We delete the copy manually so that it doesn't block the flush command under Oracle (which does not cascade deletions).
We demote it back to INNER join (in AND case a single vote is enough).
We didn't find a lookup.
We didn't find the current field, so move position back one step.
We didn't keep up with the live window.
We disable host name validation here so we can ping the server endpoint using localhost.
We disable this so that the severity can be better reflected in the UI.
We do also check for no-op saves later on for inheritance cases.
We do it manually and trigger re-encoding of the payload.
We do not exclude max_length if it matches default as we want to change the default in future.
We do not use `tarfile` here because: - We wish to support LZMA2 compression while also supporting Python 2.7.
We do the final setup for them a little differently from normal models.
We do the foo__bar splitting and handling when computing the SQL column names (as part of get_columns()).
We do this before the post validation due to the fact that the conditional may specify that the task be skipped due to a variable not being present which would otherwise cause validation to fail
We do this double conversion to get rid of characters that are illegal in the user's locale
We do this only here in the 'normal' action, as other action plugins may set this.
We do this ourselves to be timezone aware, email.Utils is not tz aware.
We do want to make sure these methods are ready if the ability to use .add or .remove with to_field relations is added some day.
We don't actually care about the content of the input file, either, so we actually stick *the new dependencies* in the input file, and copy that over the old dependencies (if present).
We don't add the "_excluded_files" filter.
We don't care about SRID because CoordTransform presupposes source SRS.
We don't enforce DNS length restrictions here (63 characters per label, 253 characters total) or make any attempt to process IDNs.
We don't fail here as there is code that better expresses the errors where the library is used.
We don't have access to bound_func in this scope, but we can cheat by using it on a dummy function.
We don't have any query to process, so just check what type the user expects, and return the IP address in a correct format
We don't have to deepcopy very much here, since most things are not intended to be altered after initial creation.
We don't have to wrap the following import in a 'try', because we already know 'readline' was imported successfully.
We don't hit parameter amount limits for a, so just one query for that + fast delete of the related objs.
We don't know how to merge.
We don't know this setting.
We don't know what IP version to assume, so let's check IPv4 first, then IPv6
We don't make these tests conditional because that means we would need to check and differentiate between: * MySQL+InnoDB, MySQL+MYISAM (something we currently can't do).
We don't need any fields from the model
We don't need quote_name_unless_alias() here, since these are all going to be column names (so we can avoid the extra overhead).
We don't need them for gettext anyway, so replace them with something innocuous
We don't need this filter anymore.
We don't need to check for codenames since we already have a list of the ones we're going to create.
We don't need to check stderr, but we don't want it in test output
We don't need to update the cache, just return.
We don't need to wait for certain messages, just for the ones with ids.
We don't test COOKIES content, as the result might differ between Python version because parsing invalid content became stricter in latest versions.
We don't test the output formatting - that's too fragile.
We don't try to enforce the 63-char length limit.
We don't use `import django` to figure that out, so we don't pick up a Django from site-packages or similar.
We don't use the original model instances as there are some variables that refer to the Apps object.
We don't want modules to determine that running the module fires notify handlers.
We don't want such lists to be stringified.
We don't want the individual qs doing prefetch_related now, since we have merged this into the current work.
We don't want to create dependencies between the replaced node and the replacement node as this would lead to self-referencing on the replacement node at a later iteration.
We don't want to proceed event (click on button for example), so we just skip it
We don't want to trigger the prefetch_related functionality by evaluating the query.
We end up here in the case select_related() resolution proceeds from parent model to child model.
We enforce it here for the duration of the transaction.
We examine the output line-by-line until we have negotiated any privilege escalation prompt and subsequent success/error message.
We exclude ungrouped here because it was already added as a child of 'all' at the time it was created.
We expect top level keys to correspond to groups, iterate over them to get host, vars and subgroups (which we iterate over recursivelly)
We explicitly connect to the "other" database here.
We failed silently on open().
We fallback to the stream_url in the original info, this cannot be always used, sometimes it can give an HTTP 404 error
We first look for clipid, because clipprog always appears before
We first sort by name, if present.
We generate definitions for these variables on the fly when processing a rule.
We generate one INNER JOIN to D.
We get 3 queries - 1 for main query, 1 for content_objects since they all use the same table, and 1 for the 'read_by' relation.
We get the available subtitles
We get the dictionary of the track from some javascript code
We got a text frame before we completed the previous one
We got an IP address, let's mark it as such
We had to look ahead, but it wasn't need to compute the quantifier, so use this character next time around the main loop.
We have a query string but it's not in the known query types.
We have a simple talk
We have a sub-filter.
We have a valid CIDR, so let's write it in correct format
We have change perm on books, so we can add/change/delete inlines
We have copied the file remotely and no longer require our content_tempfile
We have leading zeros up to or past the decimal point.
We have not changed self.cleaned_data.
We have not seen a closing angle bracket yet, but it's probably a few lines later if we look for it, so just return early here.
We have the parent data in the obj, but we don't have a nice way to turn that data into parent object instance.
We have to add and unref the alias so that join promotion has information of the join type for the unused alias.
We have to add extra_info to the results because it may be contained in a playlist
We have to do some pretty insane escaping to get those backslashes and dollar signs past make, the shell, and sed at the same time.
We have to explicitly override __getstate__ so that older versions of pickle don't try to pickle the __dict__ (which in the case of a SimpleLazyObject may contain a lambda).
We have to fetch the model to test with from the main app cache, as it's not a direct dependency.
We have to fixup the deps output in a few ways.
We have to handle the possibility that the QuerySet we just got back contains some prefetch_related lookups.
We have to import QueryDict down here to avoid a circular import.
We have to perform the one-time registration here.
We have to remove the javascript callback
We have to retrieve the url
We have to special-case M2Ms as a list of comma-separated PKs.
We have to test this carefully.
We have to try also with an explicit prefix of /usr/local in order to catch Debian's custom user site-packages directory.
We have to use SimpleLazyObject, not self.__class__, because the latter is proxied.
We have to use this slightly awkward syntax due to the fact that we're using *args and **kwargs together.
We have to use type(self), not self.__class__, because the latter is proxied.
We ignore any trailing whitespace and/or comments.
We ignored case earlier, but use it as a final ranking basis.
We implement a whitelist of safe macros instead of a blacklist of unsafe macros, even though the latter appears less frequently in google code and would have been easier to implement.
We install host executables into shared_intermediate_dir so they can be run by gyp rules that refer to PRODUCT_DIR.
We instead explicitly write all the rules we care about.
We intentionally register Promo and ChapterXtra1 but not Chapter nor ChapterXtra2.
We just do this once per app
We just ran chown successfully, so apparently we are root.
We just want to check the setting stuff works.
We just want to pass it.
We just wrote a non-BMP character
We keep this code here in case we have to special-case any tests (on a short-term basis) to be run serially after all of the parallel tests have finished.
We keep track of methods and subs that have been sent from the client so that we only return to the prompt or quit the app once we get back all the results from the server.
We know that there will already be a join on the join table, so we can just add the select.
We know that we've broken the __iter__ method, so the queryset should always raise an exception.
We limit the hash to 20 chars to keep URL short
We look for Open Graph info: We have to match any number spaces between elements, some sites try to align them (eg.: statigr.am)
We loop over every form.errors here rather than short circuiting on the first failure to make sure validation gets triggered for every form.
We made it this far, grab the first and hopefully only item in the list
We made it this far, grab the first and hopefully only server in the list
We make a single pass through each line of the inventory, building up self.groups and adding hosts, subgroups, and setting variables as we go.
We make an exception for nested parens ( (a+b) + c ).
We may get a filename encoded with 'encodeFilename'
We may have opened the empty placeholder file.
We may have previously seen a "all-models" request for this app (no model qualifier was given).
We may want to generate unique common name and verify it.
We may want to required that at least x number of forms are completed, but we'll show how to handle that later.
We may want to validate that they are consistent.
We might have a path or we might have to read the data into memory.
We might have an IPv4 mapped address.
We must be able to import youtube_dl
We must commit the transaction to ensure that MySQL gets a fresh read, since by default it runs in REPEATABLE READ mode
We must cope with more than one column having the same underlying sort field, so we base things on column numbers.
We must first write out each node within its file grouping before writing out any edges that may refer to those nodes.
We must have at least one label
We must keep track of which models we have already seen.
We must make sure the inner query has the referred columns in it.
We must promote any new joins to left outer joins so that when Q is used as an expression, rows aren't filtered due to joins.
We must use outer joins in OR case when the join isn't contained in all of the joins.
We need a new file name.
We need another database connection in transaction to test that one connection issuing a SELECT ...
We need nsapp to be top-level so our multiple-paths tests can add another location for it (if its inside a normal package with an __init__.py that isn't possible).
We need one instance for each group in order to get the right db:
We need the embed website after all
We need the field that points to the target model, so we can tell alter_field to change it - this is m2m_reverse_field_name() (as opposed to m2m_field_name, which points to our model)
We need the number of potentially affected rows after an "UPDATE", not the number of changed rows.
We need this because of django.db.models.query_utils.Q.
We need this to be a queryset since parent classes introspect it to find information about the model.
We need this to behave just like the CsrfViewMiddleware, but not reject requests or log warnings.
We need to avoid hitting __reduce__, so define this slightly weird copy construct.
We need to be able to dynamically add to the list of prefetch_related lookups that we look up (see below).
We need to be able to modify the inventory
We need to be careful so that we get the params in right places.
We need to change that to accommodate other language docs, but I can't work out how to make that work.
We need to define functions that get called later.)
We need to differentiate between "provided, but using default value", and "not provided".
We need to encode it back into a string to write it out.
We need to ensure that it is displayed
We need to ensure we don't keep adding lookups from the same relationships to stop infinite recursion.
We need to enter transaction management again, as this is done on per-thread basis
We need to generate a derived key from our base key.
We need to get a file object for Pillow.
We need to hardcode ModelBase and Field cases because its __str__ method doesn't return "applabel.modellabel" and cannot be changed.
We need to have at least one ':'.
We need to import QuerySet here so as to avoid circular
We need to inject a modified open() builtin into the images module that checks if the file was closed properly if the function is called with a filename instead of an file object.
We need to inspect the HTML generated by the fancy 500 debug view but the test client ignores it, so we send it explicitly.
We need to keep the cookies, see ticket #4994.
We need to load all fields for each model, except those that appear in "seen" (for all models that appear in "seen").
We need to modify model._meta.db_table, but everything explodes if the change isn't reversed before the end of this method.
We need to move any non-generated sources that are coming from the shared intermediate directory out of LOCAL_SRC_FILES and put them into LOCAL_GENERATED_SOURCES.
We need to run the related field's get_prep_value().
We need to set settings.DEBUG to True so we can capture the output SQL to examine.
We need to sort the keys, and iterate over the sorted list.
We need to take all dependencies from the first migration in the list as it may be 0002 depending on 0001
We need to temporarily resolve the swappable dependency to prevent circular references.
We need to test this way because datetime.datetime inherits from datetime.date:
We need to transform the geom to the srid specified in `transform()`, so wrapping the geometry placeholder in transformation SQL.
We need to undo this in order to adhere to the Django convention of using the empty string instead of null, but only if the field accepts the empty string.
We need to use DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS here, as QuerySet does not have (nor should it have) knowledge of which connection is going to be used.
We need to work with rendered models
We need two different tests to check URLconf substitution -  one to check it was changed, and another one (without self.urls) to check it was reverted on teardown.
We never need to explicitly depend on previous target's link steps, because no compile ever depends on them.
We note the need for the warning here, but present it after the command is run, so it's more likely to be seen.
We now execute the Python code in a context that contains a 'models' object, representing the versioned models as an app registry.
We now loop through the remaining parameters both to ensure that all the parameters are valid fields and to determine if at least one of them needs distinct().
We now pick which formats have to be downloaded
We only assign to this when initialization is complete as it is used as a flag for initialization being complete.
We only download the first fragment
We only download the first fragment during the test
We only get here if no undefined combinations of headers are specified.
We only look in og:video if the MIME type is a video, don't try if it's a Flash player:
We only need a single episode info, so restricting page size to one episode and dealing with page number as with episode number
We only need to add() if created because if we got an object back from get() then the relationship already exists.
We only need to log in once for courses or individual videos
We only special-case base64 transfer encoding We should always decode base64 chunks by multiple of 4, ignoring whitespace.
We only support row level perms
We only support timezone when formatting datetime objects, not date objects (timezone information not appropriate), or time objects (against established django policy).
We only test things here that are difficult to test elsewhere Many other tests are found in the main tests for builtin template tags Test parsing via the printed parse tree
We only want one redirect, bypassing CommonMiddleware
We only want the default expensive calculation run on creation and set
We only want the default expensive calculation run once
We only want to shim targets that have msvs_large_pdb enabled.
We only want to warn on the latter case.
We only write the file if the contents have changed so that simply regenerating the project files doesn't cause a relink.
We pay attention to timeouts only while negotiating a prompt.
We pick mp3-320 for now, until format selection can be easily implemented.
We pickle the wrapped object as the unpickler's argument, so that pickle will pickle it normally, and then the unpickler simply returns its argument.
We precreate them here as an optimization
We process each entry in the playlist
We provide a number of different signatures for this method, and the logic here is all about converting them into a 4-tuple single parameter which does the actual work of expanding the envelope.
We really need to operate as if they'd requested '/'.
We regroup everything inside the capturing group so that it can be quantified, if necessary.
We rely on the environment because it's currently the only way to reach WSGIRequestHandler.
We rely on the ordering of the creation_counter of the original instance
We rely on this, so don't change the order without changing the logic.
We remove "_gyp" from the names because it helps to diff them.
We remove every migration that we applied from this set so that we can bail out once the last migration has been applied and don't always run until the very end of the migration process.
We remove things from the deferred SQL that match our table name, too
We replace the current list of parent objects with the list of related objects, filtering out empty or missing values so that we can continue with nullable or reverse relations.
We replicate it here so that we can warn users when they have duplicate dict keys (pyyaml silently allows overwriting keys)
We replicate this behavior here.
We report migrate messages at one level lower than that requested.
We report only the first such error here.
We roughly follow DNS rules here, but also allow ranges (and underscores).
We run all tests in serial on Windows because Python's multiprocessing library has issues: https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html#windows
We run the old version through the field renames to account for those
We run the tests in Nuclide/spec in a separate integration test step.
We run this at the beginning of the next loop since we cannot be sure a file is complete until we hit the next boundary/part of the multipart content.
We set LOCAL_PATH just once, here, to the top of the project tree.
We set an explicit pk instead of relying on auto-incrementation, so we need to reset the database sequence.
We set any flags based on examining the output in self._flags.
We set the original url as the default 'Referer' header
We set this to a multiple of the value to speed up file reads.
We set up a rule to build the first output, and then set up a rule for each additional output to depend on the first.
We should also be able to pickle things that use select_related().
We should be able to handle pre-built project files by reading the GUID from the files.
We should be able to use Funcs when inserting new data
We should be more systematic here about defining what is acceptable, how quotes work, and so on.
We should call the contribute_to_class method only if it's bound
We should have seen (and removed) all the expected annotation texts.
We should have the debug flag in the template.
We should have the request object in the template.
We should never be asking for the build_dir if we've provided a VM path.
We shouldn't be able to render yet
We shouldn't have faked that one
We shouldn't raise a further exception.
We simplify things by making Oracle identifiers always uppercase.
We simply find the first C++ file and use that extension.
We skip this handler due to the fact that it may be using a variable in the name that was conditionally included via set_fact or some other method, and we don't want to error out unnecessarily
We sort them based on their priority so that certain fields can be loaded before others, if they are dependent.
We special-case `list` rather than something more generic like `Iterable` because we don't want to accidentally match user models that define __iter__.
We start out by making sure that Bob is in no groups.
We start out by making sure that Jane has no groups.
We start out by making sure that the Group 'CIA' has no members.
We start out with a some duplicate data.
We start with get() and not get_or_create() in order to use the db_for_read (see #20401).
We still perform lint checks on these lines, but
We still tell link to generate a manifest, but we only use that to assert that our simpler process did not miss anything.
We store a reference to the TU in the instance so the TU won't get collected before the cursor.
We store accumulated stdout and stderr output from the process here, but strip any privilege escalation prompt/confirmation lines first.
We support two kinds of shared objects (.so): 1) shared_library, which is just bundling together many dependent libraries into a link line.
We swallow that output with a pipe.
We test once if sshpass is available, and remember the result.
We test these methods because .add/.remove aren't available for m2m fields with through, but through is the only way to set to_field currently.
We test this by checking if the file was opened.
We then serialize the current state of the database into a string and store it on the connection.
We translate between these two notions of paths with two helper functions:
We treat FormSet pretty much like we would treat a normal Form.
We trust that users of values() know what they are doing.
We try three options, in order of decreasing preference.
We try to start accessibility server only if we don't have needed method active
We update the file only if the content has changed (ignoring line ending differences).
We update the info dict with the best quality format (backwards compatibility)
We use IntegerField and not AutoField because the model is going to be deleted immediately and with an AutoField this fails on Oracle
We use PostgreSQL specific SQL here.
We use STATEMENT_TIMESTAMP to be cross-compatible with other databases.
We use codecs here because sometimes Python decides to use the ascii codec and chokes on utf-8 characters.
We use default here to ensure we can tell the difference between a read request and a write request for Auth objects
We use frozenset to make the dictionary hashable.
We use partial to give each method the name of the Attribute that it is for.
We use the name 'gyp_all_modules' as the Android build system doesn't allow the use of the Make target 'all' and because 'all_modules' is the equivalent of the Make target 'all' on Android.
We use these names to disambiguate LLDB commands from C-style expressions.
We used to return the parent's Detail record here by mistake.
We want a pattern followed by an integer or range subscript.
We want clicking on this header to bring the ordering to the front
We want journal to always take text type syslog takes bytes on py2, text type on py3
We want running the bad tests to still complete.
We want to fix up these paths
We want to get SDO Geometries as WKT because it is much easier to instantiate GEOS proxies from WKT than SDO_GEOMETRY(...) strings.
We want to know which chunks are placeholders.
We want to let any rules apply to files that are resources also.
We want to match something comprising:
We wil then just set it.
We will assign None if the field belongs to this model.
We will check again that the class does actually exist anyway.
We will get type arguments if there is a mismatch in the number of arguments.
We will need to skip the extract part and instead go directly with the originating field, that is self.lhs.lhs.
We will need to skip the extract part, and instead go directly with the originating field, that is self.lhs.lhs
We will only process correct ratios.
We will prefer bootstrap url over inline bootstrap info when present.
We will register this class temporarily in the test method.
We will stick with latter thus recursively encoding the whole query.
We will work around this by providing adjusted implementations.
We will write three rules: - All outputs depend on an intermediate file.
We wrap each .mk include in an if statement so users can tell make to not load a file by setting NO_LOAD.
We write the file in the base_path directory.
We write to a dep file on the side first and then rename at the end so we can't end up with a broken dep file.
We'll detect these cases using the exit code, which should cause 'check_call' to raise.
We'll only move things we want into 'good'.
We'll return None on FIPS enabled systems
We'll say it should occur by line 10.
We'll see how to handle that case later.
We'll then go through that list later and order it and split into migrations to resolve dependencies caused by M2Ms and FKs.
We'll update counters on each iteration just below.
We're checking the rights to an auto-created intermediate model, which doesn't have its own individual permissions.
We're dealing with a literal, so it's already been "resolved"
We're dealing with a variable that needs to be resolved
We're forcing a transaction on a non-transactional-DDL backend
We're going to have to initialize the wrapped object to successfully pickle it, so we might as well just pickle the wrapped object since they're supposed to act the same way.
We're not testing the plugin run() method, just the helper methods ActionBase defines
We're not using .download here sine that is just a shim for outside error handling, and returns the exit code instead of the result dict.
We're only interested in the fields of the result expressions.
We're only interested in the latest replaced node, so filter out replaced nodes that are parents of other replaced nodes.
We're out of ports, LiveServerTestCase correctly fails with a socket error.
We're requesting escalation with a password, so we have to wait for a password prompt.
We're requesting escalation without a password, so we have to detect success/failure before sending any initial data.
We're testing app registry presence on load, so this is handy.
We're using a custom command so we need the alternate settings
We're using regular expressions rather than time.strptime because: - They provide both validation and parsing.
We're using the posixpath module to mix paths and URLs conveniently.
We're writing a python string that's used by a variety of shells on the remote host to invoke a python "one-liner".
We've acquired a port, ensure our server threads acquired different addresses.
We've already cached all the paths at this point
We've already got a longhand ip_str.
We've determined that the last portion was an identifier and thus, not part of the module name
We've requested escalation (with or without a password), now we wait for an error message or a successful escalation.
Webpage may be served in different layout (see https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/issues/7607)
Weird field that saves the count of items in its value
Weird output rules for PBXBuildFile.
Weird output rules for PBXFileReference.
Weird, but matches Xcode.
What is inside the square brackets is validated later.
What it does, for "/usr/lib" libraries, is do "-L/usr/lib -lname" which is dependent on the library order and cause collision when building Chrome.
What matters here is that the key is in include_state.
What we do is daemonize a part of this module, the daemon runs the command, picks up the return code and output, and returns it to the main process.
What we're left with now must be an IPv4 or IPv6 address, possibly with numeric ranges, or a hostname with alphanumeric ranges.
When '*' is a fragment by itself, it matches a non-empty dotless fragment.
When RadioSelect is used with auto_id, and the whole form is printed using either as_table() or as_ul(), the label for the RadioSelect will point to the ID of the *first* radio button.
When USE_TZ is True, this is interpreted as the default user time zone.

When there are multiple paths to a table from another table, we have to be careful not to accidentally reuse an inappropriate join when using select_related().
When there are several instances of the origin
When there is a loop-in-loop, the state is bound to the inner loop, so it resets when the outer loop continues.

field order is deliberately inverted.
field.default may be unhashable, so a set isn't used for "in" check.

first two asserts are just sanity checks, this is the kicker:
first two asserts just sanity checks, this is the kicker:
first we assert that the defaults as viewed as a whole are the merged results of the defaults from each role, with the last role defined "winning" when there is a variable naming conflict
first we check with the full result of get_name(), which may include the role name (if the handler is from a role).
first we compile any vars specified in defaults/main.yml for all roles within the specified play
first we pull the role name out of the data structure, and then use that to determine the role path (which may result in a new role name, if it was a file path)
first we test with a bad errno to verify it bombs out
first, we use the original parent method to correctly load the object via the load_data/preprocess_data system we normally use for other playbook objects
first_found loops are special.

helper methods for use below in evaluating changed/failed_when
here is where we build the table of contents...
here we don't need to make an additional call, will default to 'us-east-1' if the below evaluates to None.
here we encode the args, so we have a uniform charset to work with, and split on white space
here we place any excess chunk back onto the stream, as well as throwing away the CRLFCRLF bytes from above.
here we rely on .split() being called inside the _fetch() in trans_real.translation()
here's a fun little line of code for you:
hex has invalid boolean value
hexadecimal begin:end
hh should should work with 0 retries.
hhvm_wrapper emits an extra line to let us know its compiling bytecode.
hit, return cached response
hls formats may have invalid width
host 0 shouldn't be in the failed hosts, as the error was handled by a rescue block
host keys are actually saved in close() function below in order to control ordering.
host migh not exist anymore
host might not exist anymore
hostname is often empty for non-static IP hosts

if we have a task and we're delegating to another host, figure out the variables for that host now so we don't have to rely on hostvars later
if we have a task in this context, and that task has a role, make sure it sees its defaults above any other roles, as we previously (v1) made sure each task had a copy of its roles default vars

if we're checking for prompts, do it now
if we're looking to start at a specific task, iterate through the tasks for this host until we find the specified task
if we're ok with getting a 304, set the timestamp in the header, otherwise make sure we don't get a cached copy

o cleanup ctypes wrapping, would be nice to separate the ctypes details more clearly, and hide from the external interface (i.e., help(cindex)).
o expose code completion APIs.
o fix memory management issues (currently client must hold on to index and translation unit, or risk crashes).
o implement additional SourceLocation, SourceRange, and File methods.

reverse instance collections
reverse sorting is needed because prepending using deque.extendleft also effectively reverses values
rhs should be an iterable of 2 values, we use batch_process_rhs to prepare/transform those values
rigged assets are parented under armature nodes
role names that are simply numbers can be parsed by PyYAML as integers even when quoted, so turn it into a string type
roles listed in a file, one per line
roles were specified directly, so we'll just go out grab them (and their dependencies, unless the user doesn't want us to).
root can read things that don't have read bit but can't execute them without the execute bit, so we might need to set that even if we're root.

save current position so we know when we've looped back around and need to break try and find an unblocked host with a task to run
save the attributes on the existing (duped) stdin so that we can restore them later after we set raw mode
save the error, which we'll raise later if we don't end up skipping this task during the conditional evaluation step
save the failed/unreachable hosts, as the run_handlers() method will clear that information during its execution
save the notification target in the result, if it was specified, as this task may be running in a loop in which case the notification may be item-specific, ie.
save the omit value for later checking
save the original ds for use later
save the play context variables to a temporary dictionary, so that we can modify the job vars without doing a full copy and later restore them to avoid modifying things too early
save work of second scan if the directories are the same
save_instance should honor the passed-in exclude keyword.

there is one user on each database
there should be no problem saving - but the attribute is not saved
there shouldn't be any messages on second GET request
there will be a blank line at the end of 'trace'
there's a ticket to add a date lookup, we can remove this special case if that makes it's way in
there's blend shapes, let check for animation
these all write to temp3.txt.gz
these are the separators for non-monetary numbers.
these don't fail because you may want to transfer a log file that possibly MAY exist but keep going to fetch other log files
these don't really return anything or raise errors, so we're pretty much calling these for coverage right now
these keys will be compared case sensitive in self.has_changed()
these tests use each other's data
these values will be casted to int
these variables keep track of opening block locations, as we only want to replace matched pairs of print/block tags
this URL now comes through reverse(), thus url quoting and iri_to_uri encoding
this allows one level of nesting.
this also tests correct video id extraction
this can be configured to blacklist SCMS but cannot add new ones unless the code is also updated
this can be made configurable, not should not use ansible.cfg
this can happen from particular API usages, particularly if not run from /usr/bin/ansible-playbook
this can happen with modules which take no params, like ping:
this can happen with powershell modules when there is no analog to a Windows command (like chmod)
this can occasionally happen, simplify
this changes the default search order paramiko implements

this is a field attribute, so copy it over directly
this is a hashed known host entry
this is a little sloppy, but makes life easier allow GEOSGeometry types (python wrappers) or pointer types
this is a loader as well
this is a much simpler form of what is in pydoc.py
this is a variant of code found in connection_plugins/paramiko.py and we should modify the paramiko code to import and use this.
this is an important step.
this is ideal for skipping controller or proxy nodes that may apply to a Blender but not a 3js scene
this is needed for applying modifiers, if it is necessary record the selected nodes so that selection is restored later
this is not used since 0.5 but people might still have in config
this is obviously a bug
this is purely for testing the data doesn't matter here :)
this is the 'extra gross' scenario detailed above, so we grab the args and pass them in as additional arguments, which can/will be overwritten via dict updates from the other arg sources below
this is the actual test for #18432
this is the exception we expect when the alarm signal fires, so we simply ignore it to move into the cleanup
this is the overridden behaviour
this is the whitelist of AST nodes we are going to allow in the evaluation.
this just needs to be set to use TLS
this key does not match a field attribute, so it must be a role param
this key is both longer than 250 characters, and has spaces
this line will be found in the file
this line will not be found, as it is out of the index range
this line will raise an AttributeError without the accompanying fix
this list matches the expected URL types and names returned when you try to resolve a non-existent URL in the first level of included URLs in named_urls.py (e.g., '/included/non-existent-url')
this makes isdisjoint work for untagged
this method will be used to create object labels by the QuerySetIterator.
this might not work well after fork
this particular item is to be skipped
this prevents setting defaults on required items
this sets distribution to what's in the data, e.g. CentOS, Scientific, ...
this should also set self.enabled
this should be something we can parse with urlparse
this should never happen, but error out with a helpful message to the user if it does...
this should never happen, but if it does fail quitely and not with a traceback
this should show if systemd is the boot init system, if checking init faild to mark as systemd these mirror systemd's own sd_boot test http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/sd_booted.html
this should start a new server
this should work as if blocktrans was not there (#19915)
this should work by default but doesn't, so we fix it
this sometimes happens and retrying helps
this task added a new group (group_by module)
this task added a new host (add_host module)
this task had a loop, and has more than one result, so loop over all of them instead of a single result
this typically means we couldn't even parse the docstring, not just that the YAML is busted, probably a quoting issue.
this url exists, but requires an argument
this url is used on mobile devices
this uses exceptions as it happens before we can safely call fail_json
this videos are protected by DRM, the f4m downloader doesn't support them
this way we don't get ugly syntax coloring
this will be addressed in a future version of this script.
this will be called again in parent, but it's needed now - before we get the spatial_aggregate_name
this will preserve the order of hosts after intersecting them
this would be the usual behaviour

we add to this as we go through.
we added exactly one item, len() should reflect that
we also test the case where matchpathcon returned a failure
we always start the search for roles in the base directory of the playbook
we are actually running plays
we are doing a listing
we are going to ignore unknown lines here - this may be a bad idea - but you can override it in your subclass
we are just doing a listing
we assume each item in the list is itself a list, as we support "conditional includes" for vars_files, which mimics the with_first_found mechanism.
we can get normals by retrieving each control point
we can only use tty when we are not pipelining the modules.
we can't mix TextField (NCLOB) and CharField (NVARCHAR), so convert all fields to NCLOB when we expect NCLOB
we can't use .assertRaises, since we want to inspect the exception
we continue on loader failures
we create a new data structure here, using the same object used internally by the YAML parsing code so we can preserve file:line:column information if it exists
we create the state in a different dir from the one we run our tests on, to verify that the saved state does not depend on any absolute paths
we do not have a full context here, and the missing variable could be because of that, so just show a warning and continue
we do not want to include the u"" or u'' prefix so we build the string rather than interpolate the tuple
we don't care about nonzero exit codes...
we don't care here, because the action may simply not have a corresponding action plugin
we don't create repo_dir using mkdtemp() because we want to create it with copytree().
we don't currently care about this final response, we just receive it and drop it.
we don't define the usual template_name here
we don't have access to the cwd, probably because of sudo.
we don't need to store the salt, but Django used to do this
we don't use iteritems() here to avoid problems if the underlying dict changes sizes due to the templating, which can happen with hostvars
we don't want the full set of attributes (the task lists), as that would lead to a serialize/deserialize loop
we don't want to re-assign these values, which were determined by the ModuleArgsParser() above
we expect negative retncode if kill option was given
we expect zero retncode if no kill option
we find no header, so we just mark this fact and pass on the stream verbatim
we first test the cases where the python selinux lib is not installed
we first try to load this data as JSON
we force saving language to a cookie rather than a session by excluding session middleware and those which do require it
we handle any 'vars' specified in the ds here, as we may be adding things to them below (special handling for includes).
we have a field which also returns a name
we have our match, so clear the start_at_task field on the play context to flag that we've started at a task (and future plays won't try to advance)
we have registered two models from two different apps
we have to use indexes, and then parse out the other parts not supported by indexing
we import here to prevent a circular dependency with imports
we import this here to prevent an import loop problem, since the objects code also imports ansible.errors
we know we can skip this, as it's not going to be found on galaxy.ansible.com
we merge in vars from groups specified in the inventory (INI or script)
we need to clean up after ourselves -- only do this on test success
we need to do this so decimal places get normalized
we need to register a custom ModelAdmin (instead of just using ModelAdmin) because the field creator tries to find the ModelAdmin for the related model
we need to test only one call of migrate
we only allow one callback of type 'stdout' to be loaded, so check the name of the current plugin and type to see if we need to skip loading this callback plugin
we only cache in the case where we have a single variable name, to make sure we're not putting things which may otherwise be dynamic in the cache (filters, lookups, etc.)
we only extract files, and remove any relative path bits that might be in the file for security purposes and drop the leading directory, as mentioned above
we ran out of attempts, so mark the result as failed
we replicate Color to register with another ModelAdmin
we return the values in the order they were originally specified in the given hosts array
we run the --json version first because --json --refactor doesn't change any files, but plain --refactor does (i.e. the latter isn't idempotent)
we should be redirected to the login page.
we shouldn't get a 500 error caused by a NoReverseMatch
we shouldn't include a file more than once.
we skip basic code as they are added explicitly
we split on spaces and newlines separately, so that we can tell which character we split on for reassembly inside quotation characters
we store the role path internally
we strip off the top-level directory for all of the files contained within the tar file here, since the default is 'github_repo-target', and change it to the specified role's name
we unfortunately need to template the delegate_to field here, as we're fetching vars before post_validate has been called on the task that has been passed in
we use an in-source build for now and never want to install
we want to get rid of files encrypted with the AES cipher
we want to upstream this to atom, so do not require nuclide- prefix
we won't error here, as it may *not* be a problem, and we don't want to break modules unnecessarily
we'll also need a temp file to hold our module arguments
we're done with the child state, so clear it and continue back to the top of the loop to get the next task
we're not changing the length of the sequence
we're only interested if we can find a function parameter of that type
we're running as root on the local system so do some trivial checks for ensuring 'host' is actually a chroot'able dir
we're using a real play context here
we've moved the module_common relative to the snippets, so fix the path
