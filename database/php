As a convenience, this class also implements the Iterator interface, allowing the collection of values to be navigated using the methods defined in that interface.
As a result, gd automatically blends the existing color at that point with the drawing color, and stores the result in the image.
As a rule of thumb your code should always be able to work correctly if assertion checking is not activated.
As a rule, there is no need to invoke it directly, from either inside or outside the `WP_Query` object.
As a rule, there is no need to invoke it directly.
As an example, if you want to edit the global config.json file.
As an extra last resort, Change back to / if the folder wasn't found.
As error levels are added, the range of integers increases, so older integer-based error levels will not always behave as expected.

As per the ECMA and JSON specification an object may have any string as a property.
As soon as HHVM is changed to "normal" Zend behavior, these tests need to be edited/removed
As stated above, the first value wins.
As such, it can be used to implement a set (a collection of unique values) where the quality of an object being unique is determined by the value returned by this function being unique.
As such, this test had to be slightly modified.
As we can't fix it, we document how it has behaved from the first day on.
As we couldn't find a site, we're simply not installed.
As we just have valid percent encoded sequences we can just explode and ignore the first member of the returned array (an empty string).

At least IIS can be configured to do this.
At least one host must be given (port optional, always defaulting to 27017) and as many hosts as desired may be connected to.

Attachments can be 'inherit' status, we need to base count off the parent's status if so.
Attachments have since changed since version 2.5, so this is most likely inaccurate, but serves generally as an example of what is possible.
Attachments may also be made the child of a post, so if that is an accurate statement (which needs to be verified), it would then be possible to get all of the attachments for a post.

Be aware that all executable phar archives must contain .phar in their filename.
Be aware that no non-executable archives cannot contain .phar in their filename.
Be aware that some non-compliant headers (notably cookie headers) cannot be joined this way.
Be careful if you choose to escape characters 0, a, b, f, n, r, t and v.
Be careful when using this option, as it will also disable autodiscovery.
Be sure to check the object's exists() method if you need to confirm the theme's existence.
Be sure to flush the rewrite rules - see flush_rewrite_rules() - when your plugin gets activated and deactivated.
Be warned, be careful.
Because PHP's integer type is signed and many platforms use 32bit integers, filesize() may return unexpected results for files which are larger than 2GB.
Because a `Pair` is immutable by default, this just returns the current object.
Because every system is setup differently, phpinfo() is commonly used to check configuration settings and for available predefined variables on a given system.
Because exported to JS and assigned to document.title.
Because it's setting these settings for the entire page (as is the nature of HTTP headers), this should only be used once per page (again, at the top).
Because of eccentricities in the performance of libresolv between platforms, DNS_ANY will not always return every record, the slower DNS_ALL will collect all records more reliably.
Because of the MessageFormatter class, the program does not need to know the order of the fragments.
Because of the way splay trees work, the engine also has to deal with a lot of changes to the large tree object graph.
Because of this, it is highly recommended to ensure that your webpages are served as UTF-8.
Because of this, it may be best to reserve this function for servers which explicitly require preallocation.

For built-in post types such as posts and pages, the 'public' value will be evaluated.
For case-insensitive searches, use stristr().
For cases where the array was converted to an object.
For certain 'transient' failures, like download_failed, we should allow retries.
For clearing the cache during unit tests, consider using wp_cache_init().
For comment authors who are the author of the post
For compatibility, always connect to the IPv4 address.
For consistency with explode(), however, it may be less confusing to use the documented order of arguments.
For currencies you can use currency format type to create a formatter that returns a string with the formatted number and the appropriate currency sign.
For custom post types, we need to add on endpoints as well.
For custom taxonomies use get_the_terms().
For data that is larger than this (movies, music, Henry Kissinger's autobiography), use MongoGridFS.
For data that is smaller than 16MB, you may find it easier to embed it within the document using MongoBinData.

For every step of the algorithm, the hare takes two steps and the tortoise one.
For example MO/PO can derive the logic from their headers.
For example, ": foo" will not be recognized as an XHP name by the parser.
For example, "MMMdd" and "mmhh" are skeletons.
For example, 'header_textcolor', 'header_image', and so on depending on the theme options.
For example, 200 for success and 500 for server error.
For example, Britain converted in 1752, The USSR in 1918 and Greece in 1923.
For example, MONTH_IN_SECONDS wrongly assumes every month has 30 days and YEAR_IN_SECONDS does not take leap years into account.
For example, MessageFormatter enables you to print the phrase "Finished printing x out of y files..." in a manner that still allows for flexibility in translation.
For example, PDO_PGSQL() requires you to specify the name of a sequence object for the name parameter.
For example, Twenty Fourteen already has tag.php for Tag archives, category.php for Category archives, and author.php for Author archives.
For example, Twenty Thirteen already has tag.php for Tag archives, category.php for Category archives, and author.php for Author archives.
For example, Twenty Twelve already has tag.php for Tag archives, category.php for Category archives, and author.php for Author archives.
For example, both "MMM-dd" and "dd/MMM" produce the skeleton "MMMdd".
For example, default posts term counts (for custom taxonomies) don't include private / draft posts.
For example, during a timeout in a query, the MySQL connection gets closed.
For example, if .mo files are located in the locale folder then Domain Path will be "/locale/" and must have the first slash.
For example, if there is no occurrence of pattern, an array with only one element will be returned.
For example, if you set the limit to 2, and you try a third connection on the same pool, an `AsyncMysqlConnectException` exception will be thrown.
For example, if you use bar as thousands_sep on the number 1000, number_format() will return 1b000.
For example, if you're simply outputting data straight from an HTML form.
For example, it may allow protected and private methods to be invoked.
For example, it may allow protected and private properties to be accessed.
For example, it puts together the home page when no home.php file exists.
For example, it seems that on Linux when connecting to MySQL 5.1, the server always manages to send a full a reply.
For example, libenchant.dll loads libenchant_myspell.dll or libenchant_ispell.dll
For example, logged-on user's ID.
For example, on Linux, reiserfs may provide better performance than ext2fs.
For example, puts together date-based pages if no date.php file exists.
For example, set fuzz to 10 and the color red at intensities of 100 and 102 respectively are now interpreted as the same color for the purposes of the floodfill.
For example, sqlite will wait for up to this time value before giving up on obtaining an writable lock, but other drivers may interpret this as a connect or a read timeout interval.
For example, suppose that the input pattern is "hhmmssSSSS", and the best matching pattern internally is "H:mm:ss", and the decimal string is ",".
For example, suppose that the input skeleton is "GyyyyMMMd", and there is no matching pattern internally, but there is a pattern matching "yyyyMMMd", say "d-MM-yyyy".
For example, suppose you tried to insert two documents with the same _id:  This would produce output like:  Note that the MongoDB error code (11000) is used for the PHP error code.
For example, tag.php (Tag archives), category.php (Category archives), author.php (Author archives), etc.
For example, the files document is something like:  and the chunks documents look like:  Of course, the default chunk size is thousands of bytes, but that makes an unwieldy example.
For example, the screen ID for the Posts list table is edit-post, so the filter for that screen would be manage_edit-post_columns.
For example, they are allowed in the VALUES() list of an INSERT statement (to specify column values for a row), or in a comparison with a column in a WHERE clause to specify a comparison value.
For example, this can be used to set the envelope sender address when using sendmail with the -f sendmail option.
For example, this returns "foo":    However, these return NULL:    To avoid surprising behavior, it is best not to depend on MongoDB to decide what to return, but to explicitly state a return value.
For example, to embed an image in a document, one could write:    This class contains a type field, which currently gives no additional functionality in the driver or the database.
For example, to insert the name O'reilly into a database, you will need to escape it.
For example, to profile all queries that take longer than one second, run:    Profiled queries will appear in the system.profile collection of this database.
For example, to retrieve options at the socket level, a level parameter of SOL_SOCKET would be used.
For example, use the WHERE and SORT BY clauses in SQL to restrict results before retrieving and processing them with PHP.
For example, we could do: Example #2 Iterating over MongoCursor  This will go through each document in the collection, loading and garbage collecting documents as needed.
For example, what tests caused the regression.
For example, when the plugin is located in wp-content/plugins/sampleplugin/sample.php, then the name of this hook will become 'activate_sampleplugin/sample.php'.
For example, when the plugin is located in wp-content/plugins/sampleplugin/sample.php, then the name of this hook will become 'deactivate_sampleplugin/sample.php'.
For example:  Filter call.
For example: Example #1 Storing dates with MongoDate    MongoDB stores dates as milliseconds past the epoch.
For example: The segments filter can expand or ignore paths.
For flex, limit size of image displayed to 1500px unless theme says otherwise
For frameworks running in serial, just the framework name will be printed right now.
For full terms see the file COPYING.
For hierarchical taxonomies, we can't assign a term when multiple terms in the hierarchy share the same name.
For instance if PHP times out before step 6, then you will not be able to access any portion of your site.
For instance, adding a sort causes the query to become a subfield of a bigger query object, like: This method is for adding a top-level field to a query.
For instance, in the default "C" locale characters such as umlaut-a will not be converted.
For instance, in the string 'abcdef', the character at position 0 is 'a', the character at position 2 is 'c', and so forth.
For instance, this will not work:  This does not query for a user named "joe" with an age of 20.
For instance, when the single default option, 'plugins' is enabled, site administrators are granted access to the Plugins screen in their individual sites' dashboards.
For integers which may be larger than XML-RPC supports ensure we return strings.
For integration with other applications, this function can be overwritten to instead use the other package password checking algorithm.
For international trackbacks.
For iterators that return SplFileInfo objects, the second parameter is required.
For languages that use characters not supported by the font, the font can be disabled.

For non-async connections, this returns ASYNC_OP_INVALID.
For non-existent options, the default value is 'yes'.
For non-null defaults, see param_tostring_hh.php
For non-variable routes, generate links.
For now offsets are deteminded OK with readEBMLint() and that's the most important thing.
For now this will emit a warning just like if zend was compiled withot zlib
For now, as this is the one difference only between 0.9.x and 1.x, it's handled with placeholders to not to duplicate the test.
For now, remove any logging and code coverage settings from the configuration file.
For now, suppress the PHP error so as to match the missing HPHP one.
For now, surface some sort of error here.
For now, we don't do IMemoizeParam type checks on generics.
For now, we don't grow tuple-like arrays - appending to them just downgrades them to vector-like arrays

For other request methods, you will receive a return value.
For other successful queries mysqli_query() will return TRUE.
For other tax queries, grab the first term from the first clause.

For tar-based phar archives, the default extensions are .phar.tar, .phar.tar.gz, and .phar.tar.bz2.
For taxonomies that belong only to custom post types, point to a valid archive.
For test reliability, we always want this to be set
For that fatal case, we handle that a bit differently.
For that reason running wp_editor() inside of a metabox is not a good idea unless only Quicktags is used.
For that, use show_admin_bar(false) or the 'show_admin_bar' filter.
For the 'weekly' key, the 'display' would be `__( 'Once Weekly' )`.
For the below strings: 'English' is ASCII only, 'Japanese' has no ASCII characters and 'Greek' is mixed.
For the final piece: when UPLOADS is used with ms-files rewriting in multisite, the resulting URL is /files.
For the last page, need to unset earlier children in order to keep track of orphans.
For the name of just the operating system, consider using the PHP_OS constant, but keep in mind this constant will contain the operating system PHP was built on.
For the parameter, if the file is called "footer-special.php" then specify "special".
For the parameter, if the file is called "header-special.php" then specify "special".
For the parameter, if the file is called "sidebar-special.php" then specify "special".
For the purpose of this function, 'word' is defined as a locale dependent string containing alphabetic characters, which also may contain, but not start with "'" and "-" characters.
For the rest Memcache::add() behaves similarly to Memcache::set().
For the rest Memcache::replace() behaves similarly to Memcache::set().
For the stream wrapper to stat a file.
For theme-added sizes

If we pull/merge, the HEAD SHA changes.
If we reach here, PHP has failed us.
If we really need that functionality, we can do something like this instead: https://phabricator.fb.com/P20754288
If we rolled back, we want to know an error that occurred then too.
If we run N times and fail to get N bytes of random data, then CAPICOM has failed us.
If we simply failed to update before we tried to copy any files, then assume things are OK if they are now running the latest.
If we still cannot determine a value, then cycle through a list of preset possibilities.
If we still have items in the switched stack, consider ourselves still 'switched'

If we're matching a permalink, add those extras (attachments etc) on.
If we're not clearing the destination folder and something exists there already, Bail.
If we're not dealing with one of these installs, then the important part is determining the network first, because we need the network's path to identify any sites.
If we're not in wp-admin and the post has been published and preview nonce is non-existent or invalid then no need for preview in query
If we're not sure, we don't want it
If we're on the blog page that is not the homepage or a single post of any post type, use the post title.
If we're processing a 404 request, clear the error var since we found something.
If we're still here, then we're going to use this size.
If we're switching to the same blog id that we're on, set the right vars, do the associated actions, but skip the extra unnecessary work
If we're the first byte of sequence:
If we're using the direct method, we can predict write failures that are due to permissions.

MySQL server has gone away, try to reconnect
MySQL server may not support this - ignore errors
MySQL will silently truncate this data if it is inserted into a `utf8` column.
N.B pi() ignores all specified arguments no error  messages are produced if arguments are spcified.
NB: DateTimeZone class does not define a customized compare class handler so standard object handler will be used
NB: The names need to be all-lowercase to ensure that "someexception" has a lower litstr id than "other" (both original and lowercase versions of the name get put in the litstr table).
NB: The strings passed are *NOT* necessarily encoded in the encoding passed to the function.
NB: These will return false in server mode
NB: basic functionality tested in tests/strings/001.phpt
NOTE - this will cause an error and it OK When using unbuffered prepared statements MySQL expects you to fetch all data from the row before sending new data to the server.
NOTE this test can fail on asm builds of zlib 1.2.5 or  1.2.7 on at least Windows and Darwin.

NOTE:* Any current target attributed will be stripped and replaced.
NS  target: FQDN of the name server which is authoritative for this hostname.
NSV  - audio/video - Nullsoft Streaming Video (NSV)
NULL indicates an invalid argument was supplied to the function.
NULL is also returned in case of an error such as an invalid callback.
NULL is returned if no error occurred.
NULL is returned if the json cannot be decoded or if the encoded data is deeper than the recursion limit.
NULL may be passed instead, to reset this handler to its default state.
NULL or not there at all
Name could be the name of the single test file for a given framework, or the actual framework name if we are running in serial, for example

Note that seeking past EOF is not considered an error.
Note that short query responses (less than 1MB) are always effectively snapshotted.
Note that slug cannot be updated via wp_update_nav_menu_object().

Note that the data itself is not encrypted.
Note that the default return value comes BEFORE the arguments to the function.
Note that the default value must be a URL, NOT an attachment ID.

Note that the function does not transition the post object in the database.
Note that the keys are used in the comparison unlike array_diff() and array_udiff().
Note that the keys are used in the comparison unlike in array_intersect().
Note that the keys are used in the comparison unlike in array_uintersect().

Note that this can be thrown by any database request that receives a reply, not just queries.
Note that this cannot be used in the same SimpleTag as TagString.
Note that this changes the return value in an array where every element is an array consisting of the matched string at offset 0 and its string offset into subject at offset 1.
Note that this changes the value of matches into an array where every element is an array consisting of the matched string at offset 0 and its string offset into subject at offset 1.
Note that this comparison is case sensitive, and unlike strcmp() this function is not binary safe.
Note that this comparison is case sensitive.
Note that this function is hooked into the after_setup_theme hook, which runs before the init hook.
Note that this function modifies this Vector in place.
Note that this ignores the keys of this ImmMap and the specified Iterable.
Note that this ignores the keys of this Map and the specified Iterable.
Note that this implementation does not use a stack as in Oliver's pseudo code, but recursive calls which may or may not speed up the whole process.
Note that this is a C constant, but not exposed to PHP, so we don't define it here.
Note that this is an inclusive list: users must match *each* role.
Note that this is different from xdebug.
Note that this is not the case when compiling with WholeProgram mode, and Option::HardTypeHints, so this test is disabled for repo.
Note that this means that a cursor does not "contain" the database results, it just manages them.
Note that this means that you won't have an indication that a shard is down in your query response.
Note that this method may echo the partial *or* return the partial as a string or array, but not both.
Note that this parameter is always treated as an ASCII string regardless of the value of input-charset.
Note that this parameter is applied to the stream processed by the filters.

Note that this will only return false if this function fails to return any data.
Note that type_label is not included here.
Note that we have overridden this.
Note that we purposely don't return a reference here, since this essentially is a clone() method.
Note that we treat `-` (dashes) and `_` (underscores) as the same character, as per header parsing rules in both Apache and nginx.
Note that we're basically reimplementing next() here.
Note that when an XHP name is used in a function signature it's okay to use the XHP name without preceding whitespace as long as the previous token is not ':'.
Note that when you set a handler to an object method, that object's reference count is increased which makes it persist until you either change the handler to something else, or your script ends.
Note that you may put multiple tokens in the token parameter.
Note that you must also call MongoLog::setLevel() to turn on logging.
Note that you must also call MongoLog::setModule() to choose what part of the driver to log.
Note that you probably want to specify the mode as an octal number, which means it should have a leading zero.
Note that you should use this function even if you do not use the automatic routing to secondaries.
Note that, since 4.3.0, wp_unique_post_slug() prevents the creation of post slugs that would result in a date archive conflict.
Note the absence of FilesystemIterator::SKIP_DOTS
Note the preview-applied flag is cleared at priority 9 to ensure it is cleared before a deferred-preview runs.
Note this value is returned internally to PHP for processing.
Note we need to allow negative-integer IDs for previewed objects not inserted yet.
Note, the main site in a post-MU network uses wp-content/uploads.
Note, this does not just run on user-facing admin screens.
Note: Bad string raise Warning.
Note: Did not start form -22 offset.
Note: Due to detect order, detected as UTF-8

Note: For offset(-15).
Note: If the caption text is empty, the caption shortcode will not be appended to the image HTML when inserted into the editor.
Note: If the widget has no form, the text echoed from the default form method can be hidden using CSS.
Note: It can leak the length of a string when arguments of differing length are supplied.
Note: It does not return TRUE/FALSE for setting char
Note: No error conditions relating to passing arguments can be tested because these are not functions but statements, it will result in syntax error.
Note: Non-widescreen (4:3) mode with `width` and `height` set to `auto` will default to 480x360 video resolution.
Note: Other than string type, PHP raises Warning
Note: SWC requires zlib

Note: The filter is evaluated on both the front end and back end, including for the Inactive Widgets sidebar on the Widgets screen.
Note: The returned URL is NOT escaped.
Note: This function only returns results from the default "category" taxonomy.
Note: This implements ArrayAccess, and acts as an array of parameters when used in that manner.
Note: This is a multi-use hook in that it is leveraged both for editable post URIs and term slugs.
Note: This path may vary depending on customizations to bin-dir in  composer.json or the environmental variable COMPOSER_BIN_DIR.
Note: This should only be used in WP_REST_Server::serve_request(), as it cannot handle WP_Error internally.
Note: Though Nginx is detected, WordPress does not currently generate rewrite rules for it.
Note: Wanted to use builtin SPL for this, but it seems like the order cannot be guaranteed with their iterators.
Note: When using features provided by ArrayAccess, be aware that WordPress deliberately does not distinguish between arguments of the same name for different request methods.
Note: Will always return true if the current user is a super admin, unless specifically denied.
Note: a string of comma- separated IDs will NOT work.
Note: a string of comma-separated IDs will NOT work.
Note: arguments must be ordered as documented.

Note: basic use cases in Zend/tests/010.phpt
Note: basic use cases in Zend/tests/is_a.phpt
Note: bind_result before execute
Note: configure with --enable-dba

Note: returns last character
Note: the first four values are valid as they will all be cast to 1L.
Note: the number of weeks in a year is the date in which Dec 28 appears.

Note: these actions are also fired in wp_ajax_update_widget().
Note: this cache could easily be shared between threads
Note: this function will be removed in 4.6.

Now do it with unbuffered queries
Now exchange fruits for locations
Now extract the merged array.
Now insert the key, hashed, into the DB.
Now it is deprecated and stubbed.
Now it tells WP::parse_request() to check if a URL matching the page permastruct is actually a page before accepting it.
Now just a meaningful subset of the above, since lots of them are not number in any context on any version, and we've proven that in a couple ways already.
Now just get the incoming data unitl we find some sort of status data
Now look for larger loops.
Now parse what we've got back
Now replace any bytes that aren't allowed with their pct-encoded versions

Step 1, direct link or from language chooser.
Step 1: Find the two points with the min and max x positions.
Step 2: Use the line between the two points to divide the remaining points into two sets, one for each side of the line.
Step 3: Find the point that is farthest from the dividing line.
Step 4: Filter out all points inside the triangle formed by the new point.
Step 5: Using the two new lines, recursively create triangles to filter points until there are no more left.
Step out from this line will cause us to handle an iternext, with a fall-thru destination of the first opcode of the line after the foreach in main().

These four primitive capabilities are checked in core in various locations.
These functions are needed to load Multisite.
These functions are needed to load WordPress.
These functions are not optimized for speed, but they should only be used once in a while, so speed shouldn't be a concern.
These functions can be replaced via plugins.
These functions must be used within the WordPress Loop.
These include arguments auto-detected by the function, based on query vars, system settings, etc.
These items will not be re-installed in future upgrades, this behaviour is controlled by the introduced version present here being older than the current installed version.

These should be visible through C
These tests give us a WP-generated permalink
These three are stripslashed here so they can be properly escaped after mb_convert_encoding().
These two constants specify how many times a packet is queued and how many times a task is put on hold in a correct run of richards.
These two temps may alias, so before decrefing to overwrite it with an array(), it needs to observe the may-alias sets to ensure the incref for the return value isn't pushed past that decref.
These types will be automatically detected if your build of PHP supports them: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WBMP, and GD2.
These values are used for mb_ereg_search(), mb_ereg_search_pos(), and mb_ereg_search_regs().

They can be implemented as module functions, but there won't be many users need them.
They can get around this if they -really- want to, so don't count on it.
They don't have any meaning a such but are characteristic of a correct run so if the actual queue or hold count is different from the expected there must be a bug in the implementation.
They should all return false
They will be treated as though you called PDOStatement::setFetchMode() on the resultant statement object.
They will end up in an arbitrary relative position.
They will now be removed with the array_diff
Thickbox image paths for Network Admin.
Thickness and styled are not supported.
Things seems faster (I'm not sure I understand why) when the shortest sequence is in X.
Things that aren't switched: - autoloaded options.
Think twice before changing the default value of 1 second - you can lose all the advantages of caching if your connection is too slow.

This basically copies zend/ext/spl/tests/SplFixedArray_setSize_param_null.php but changes the expectf to match hhvm's var_dump output
This behavior is different from that of strstr().
This behavior is expected, and due to how parity was matched with the `enable_xmlrpc` UI option the filter replaced when it was introduced in 3.5.
This behaviour is unlike what array_udiff_assoc() does, since the latter compares the indices by using an internal function.
This better not iterate the dataflow algorithm forever:
This block should only be run once
This blog has more than 1 category so twentyfifteen_categorized_blog should return true.

We count the objects we leave on the stack, and expect the destruct count to be quite close to that.
We define a default value here but themes can override this by defining a "max_posts" entry in the second parameter passed in the call to add_theme_support( 'featured-content' ).
We detect legacy argument format by checking if (a) a second non-empty parameter is passed, or (b) the first parameter shares no keys with the default array (ie, it's a list of taxonomies)
We do not need to constrain the type parameter for type definitions since they cannot put constraints on their type parameters
We do only the most necessary to test it.
We do some consolidation here because the behavior when testing is really non-deterministic.

We may get one or more warnings, but then a real test status will come afterwards.
We may however, want to match EXPECT on more than 200 results, so this may need to change later.

ZEND_INIT_FCALL_BY_NAME
ZEND_INIT_STATIC_METHOD_CALL
ZEND_ISSET_ISEMPTY_VAR
ZEND_VM_DISPATCH_TO_HELPER
Zend allows the class name to be explicitly set to PDOStatement.
Zend doesn't understand 'string' and 'int' typehints, and will only allow NULL defaults.
Zend drops this set without a notice or fatal.
Zend is in the process of deprecating this behavior.
Zend will cast the NULL to 0
Zend's implementation of call_user_func() and forward_static_call() has a few corner cases where its behavior is strictly incorrect.
Zend's implementation of forward_static_call contains a check for this, implying intent to uphold this invariant.
Zero argument, expected 1 argument
Zero if they fall equally.
Zero indicates that no records were updated for an UPDATE statement, no rows matched the WHERE clause in the query or that no query has yet been executed.
Zero indicates that no records where updated for an UPDATE/DELETE statement, no rows matched the WHERE clause in the query or that no query has yet been executed.
Zero is returned if no issues are found with the input string.
Zero means no error occurred.
Zero on attempted deletion of default Category.
Zero or FALSE on failure.

`WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY` defaults to true.
`WP_DEBUG` must be true in addition to the filter evaluating to true.
`await` or `join` this result to obtain the actual connection.
`child` has tag-indexed keys after the namespace, each member of which is an indexed array matching this same format.
`compareseq' usually chooses the one at the beginning, but usually it is cleaner to consider the following identical line to be the "change".
`fun` is a special function used to create a "pointer" to a function in a typeable way.
`getException()` is the same as `getResult() in this case.
`getResult()` is the same as `getException() in this case.

array_multisort() can be used to sort several arrays at once, or a multi-dimensional array by one or more dimensions.
array_pad() returns a copy of the input padded to size specified by pad_size with value pad_value.
array_pop() pops and returns the last value of the array, shortening the array by one element.
array_product() returns the product of values in an array.
array_push() treats array as a stack, and pushes the passed variables onto the end.
array_push() will raise a warning if the first argument is not a suitable container.
array_reduce() applies iteratively the function function to the elements of the array input, so as to reduce the array to a single value.
array_replace() is not recursive : it will replace values in the first array by whatever type is in the second array.
array_replace() replaces the values of the first array with the same values from all the following arrays.
array_replace_recursive() is recursive : it will recurse into arrays and apply the same process to the inner value.
array_replace_recursive() replaces the values of the first array with the same values from all the following arrays.
array_shift() shifts the first value of the array off and returns it, shortening the array by one element and moving everything down.
array_slice() returns the sequence of elements from the array array as specified by the offset and length parameters.
array_sum() returns the sum of values in an array.
array_uintersect_assoc()
array_uintersect_uassoc() - by method call
array_uintersect_uassoc() - with ordinary function
array_unique() sorts the values treated as string at first, then will keep the first key encountered for every value, and ignore all following keys.
array_unshift() prepends passed elements to the front of the array.
array_values() returns all the values from the input array and indexes numerically the array.

key of the current element
key() returns the index element of the current array position.
key_exists() is the same as array_key_exists().
key_exists() returns TRUE if the given key is set in the array.
keys are cache-unique, so storing a second value with the same key will overwrite the original value.

libiconv(1.8) doesn't know "UTF8" but "UTF-8".
libmysql and mysqlnd will show the pdo_type entry at a different position in the hash
libmysql gives a less descriptive error message but mysqlnd, we did not unify the error messages but ignore this slight difference silently
libmysql has supported utf8mb4 since 5.5.3, same as the MySQL server.
libmysql needs this - otherwise we get a 2015 error
libmysql only - needs extra compile flag, no way to check properly in the PHP user land if its compiled in or not
libmysql return value seems to depend on server version
libmysql should return a string here whereas mysqlnd returns a native int

mb_adaptive_frame_field_flag
mb_convert_variables() assumes all parameters have the same encoding.
mb_convert_variables() join strings in Array or Object to detect encoding, since encoding detection tends to fail for short strings.
mb_ereg 'successfully' matching incorrectly:  Bug now seems to be fixed - error message is now generated when an 'empty' pattern is supplied to mb_ereg.
mb_ereg_search_init() sets string and pattern for a multibyte regular expression.
mb_internal_encoding() should be set to same encoding.
mb_output_handler() converts characters in the output buffer from internal character encoding to HTTP output character encoding.
mb_output_handler() is ob_start() callback function.
mb_send_mail() uses this setting to encode e-mail.
mb_strcut() performs equivalent operation as mb_substr() with different method.
mb_stripos() returns the numeric position of the first occurrence of needle in the haystack string.
mb_stristr() finds the first occurrence of needle in haystack and returns the portion of haystack.
mb_strpos bounds check is byte count rather than a character count: The multibyte string should be returning the same results as the ASCII string.
mb_strrchr behaves differently in different versions of libmbfl (https://github.com/facebook/hiphop-php/issues/68)
mb_strrchr() finds the last occurrence of needle in haystack and returns the portion of haystack.
mb_strrichr() finds the last occurrence of needle in haystack and returns the portion of haystack.
mb_strripos() performs multi-byte safe strripos() operation based on number of characters.
mb_strstr() finds the first occurrence of needle in haystack and returns the portion of haystack.
mbstring currently implements the following encoding detection filters.

mysqli_change_user() is automatically called on connections opened from the connection pool.
mysqli_fetch_lengths() is valid only for the current row of the result set.
mysqli_kill() "trick" does not work for any of the following because of an E_COMMANDS_OUT_OF_SYNC
mysqli_ping() cannot be tested, because one would need to cause an error inside the C function to test it
mysqli_poll() is then used to get results from such queries.
mysqli_real_connect doesn't support the host param including a port or socket like mysql_connect does.

proc_close() is similar to pclose() except that it only works on processes opened by proc_open().
proc_close() waits for the process to terminate, and returns its exit code.
proc_get_status() fetches data about a process opened using proc_open().
proc_nice() changes the priority of the current process by the amount specified in increment.
proc_nice() is not related to proc_open() and its associated functions in any way.
proc_open() is similar to popen() but provides a much greater degree of control over the program execution.
proc_terminate() allows you terminate the process and continue with other tasks.
proc_terminate() returns immediately and does not wait for the process to terminate.

socket connection failed
socket connection succeeded
socket_close() closes the socket resource given by socket.
socket_create_listen() creates a new socket resource of type AF_INET listening on all local interfaces on the given port waiting for new connections.
socket_create_pair() creates two connected and indistinguishable sockets, and stores them in fd.
socket_getpeername() may also return FALSE if the socket type is not any of AF_INET, AF_INET6, or AF_UNIX, in which case the last socket error code is not updated.
socket_getsockname() may also return FALSE if the socket type is not any of AF_INET, AF_INET6, or AF_UNIX, in which case the last socket error code is not updated.
socket_listen() is applicable only to sockets of type SOCK_STREAM or SOCK_SEQPACKET.
socket_read() returns a zero length string ("") when there is no more data to read.
socket_recv() can be used to gather data from connected sockets.
socket_recvfrom() can be used to gather data from both connected and unconnected sockets.
socket_select() accepts arrays of sockets and waits for them to change status.
socket_strerror() takes as its errno parameter a socket error code as returned by socket_last_error() and returns the corresponding explanatory text.

we are aiming for maximum compression to test MYSQLI_CLIENT_COMPRESS
we are in an array, so just push an element onto the stack
we are in an object, so figure out the property name and set an element in an associative array, for now
we are lucky, we can run the test
we assume the above as test_mysqli_get_client_stats_table_1ed and in the following we check only those
we can now properly var_dump() FVs

we have to trim as AES rounds the blocks and decrypt doesnt detect that
we haven't read a line and eof came
we know the type, position and name of this symbol, but we won't know where it's definition is
we might get the old handle
we need exclusive access for a moment
we need it to be fresh
we need to check, if the server allows anonymous login (empty user)
we need to differentiate serialized(false) and false returned because of a bad string
we need to skip this test_mysqli_get_client_stats_table_1 in unicode - we send set names utf8 during mysql_connect
we only want to know that src directory is in the include path
we really want to skip it...
we should add ruled when to expect them
we should never get here, we use warnings, but never trust a system...
we should not let date() interfere with our specially computed timestamp
we sohuld have no default link
we sohuld have no default link anymore
we want headers also, so fopen
we will repeat a max of 20 times
we'll let that decision stand
we'll override this later if the plugin can be included without fatal error
we're assuming loopback is 1.
