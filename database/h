The / semantics are that its base is evaluated and discarded, then 'b' is / evaluated and returned as the result of the expression.
The first filter in the chain is invoked on the brigade and (depending on it's return value), the next filter is invoked and so on.
The macro should be followed by a method body, which can refer to "json", "view" and "defaultView" to implement the required logic.
The size passed to mallocSmallSize does not need to be an exact size class (although stats accounting may undercount in this case).
The sqlite3_prepare() and sqlite3_prepare_v2() interfaces use UTF-8, and sqlite3_prepare16() and sqlite3_prepare16_v2() use UTF-16.
These stubs call a helper that looks up the original catch trace from the call, executes it, then executes a REQ_POST_DEBUGGER_RET.
This function finds the shared object in the custom section, loads it dynamically, and calls the initialization function within it.
This function will also pass back by reference the previous PC (if prevPc is non-null) and the previous SP (if prevSp is non-null).
This is allowed to be an implicit constructor because Operand is a wrapper class that doesn't normally perform any type conversion.
This is especially useful if you use SpatialDBOptions::bulk_load Num threads determines how many threads we'll use for compactions.
This means user might not always get full information, but whenever returned by the GetThreadList() is guaranteed to be consistent.

If the return status is non-ok, it means the specified RocksDB instance might not be correctly opened with the input set of options.
If we're doing an optimized translation, it also holds the TransID for the profiling translation associated with this piece of code.
Implementation notes: x86_64: - Since all x86_64 compilers use SSE by default, it is probably unnecessary to use these macros there.
In RepoAuthoritative mode, we flatten all traits into their users in the compile phase, which leaves m_usedTraits empty as a result.
In addition, we support an option where the request processing order can flip between FIFO or LIFO based on the length of the queue.

We need the unwinder to ignore the half-built ActRec allocated on the stack and certainly to avoid attempting to decref its contents.
We only write to prev_height_ if the nobody else has, to avoid invalidating the root of the skip list in all of the other CPU caches.
We store associated types using their index in their parent protocol in order to avoid bloating LinkEntity out to three key pointers.

Edges coming out of blocks are repesented in three ways:  - fallthrough edges (the end of the block unconditionally jumps to the named block).
For example, a ClassStatement generates different source code, depending on whether we are generating a header file or an implementation file.
For example, we may know the name of a class in a res::Class, but do not know for sure which php::Class struct is actually associated with it.
Given a heap-object instance, with some heap-object type, produce a / reference to its heap metadata by dynamically asking the runtime for it.

However, it would not be okay to / return +0 for a load from a mutable 'var', because that could / be mutated before the end of the statement.
However, other types may still refer to them (though this is very rare), so they need to be represented somehow without actually parsing them.
However, you can also pass in your FbsonWriterT or any stream object that implements some basic interface of std::ostream (see FbsonStream.h).
If an alias class contains multiple locations (e.g., a range of stack slots, multiple frame locals), we need to use multiple bits in this map.
If you're writing a C++ extension, try to avoid Variant when you can (but you often can't, and we don't really have a replacement yet, sorry).
In some cases for re-entry, we're checking for space other than just the callee, and `extraCells' may need to be passed with a non-zero value.

Insert elem into the result_ (just BEFORE the current element / byte) / Note: if Done() (i.e.: iterator points to end), this will append elem.
Instructions with these memory effects can be removed and replaced with a Mov if we have a value available that's known to be in the location.
It also has a query that / allows a client to determine whether the list is incomplete in the / sense that there may be unrepresented callees.
It exists in order to provide some encapsulation for the tricky macrology required on x64 OSX to obtain the memory locations of thread locals.
It is expected to perform better than TailingIterator by removing the encapsulation and making all information accessible within the iterator.
It may still call C++ functions on a slow path (which is why there's a Fixup operand) but it will save any required registers before doing so.
Multiple object type ids can refer to the same object type, since object types can appear multiple times (usually in different compile-units).
PropertiesInfo packages the PropState for private instance and static properties, which is cross-block information collected in CollectedInfo.

That template parameter would deduce to 'long', making this a better match than the first overload even without the first overload's EnableIf.
The FileData is stored in a shared_ptr and managed by new/delete, so it is safe to store in an object whose lifetime is longer than a request.
The IRInstruction* must not escape `func'---the aforementioned gen() methods use IRUnit::clone() to duplicate the instruction in arena memory.

The `preExit' is an exit block right before the loop that is suitable to be the target of check instructions that are hoisted out of the loop.
The class provides basic functionality to handle a reference but gives no access to it unless the reference is released, thus no longer owned.
The first process cannot proceed because it is blocked by the second and the second process cannot proceed because it is blocked by the first.
The purpose of this function is to make destructor protected so that this object is not accidentally used in conjunction with shared pointers.
The reason that this is a function that returns "this" instead of a constructor is to enable chaining of multiple similar calls in the future.

There are is a mechanism that hooks the enter/exit of every PHP function, using the Surprise flags leverages that mechanism and calls logging.
There could be a race condition if two or more processes are calling this function at the same time -- they could both pick the same filename.
These instructions are for exception handling or state syncing and do not represent any actual work, so they're excluded from the nop counter.
This file defines the LocalTypeDataCache type, which is used by IRGenFunction to cache the information available for types in a local context.
This is because doing it here would either require us to allocate more memory than we need or write into the input Array, which we don't want.
To keep the handled decl array small, we remove the Decl when it is checked, so you can only call declWasAlreadyHandled once for a given decl.
Unless otherwise noted, all methods on FlushScheduler should be called only with the DB mutex held or from a single-threaded recovery context.
Used by automatically generated separable extension code created by running thrift compiler, for example,  thrift --gen hphp my_service.thrift
We WILL change the `char *' entries, so make sure that you allocate a separate buffer for them and that you free them after sapi_deactivate().
end namespace value_witness_types / A standard routine, suitable for placement in the value witness / table, for copying an opaque POD object.
if we compile with Xcode, we don't run build_detect_vesion, so we don't generate these variables this variable tells us about the git revision
renderTo will take opacity into account and draw renderLayerTo off-screen if there is opacity specified, then composite that onto the context.
resize() and resizeIfNeeded() will grow or compact the array as necessary to ensure that there is room for a new element and a new hash entry.
(2) For people who are interested in implementing a high-performance HTTP server, derive a new class from Server just like LibEventServer does.
/    E.g. if a struct contains 2 references, a mayWrite effect means that /    memory is written to one of the referenced objects (or to both).

Also, an in-memory merge may result in writing lesser data to storage if there are duplicate records in each of these individual write buffers.
Also, we don't really need to null out vmfp() here, but doing so will cause an assert to fire if we try to re-enter before the next popVMState.
Applications that build logic basic based on file creations and deletions is suggested to implement OnFlushCompleted and OnCompactionCompleted.
As a note for future consideration, we could consider precomputing a 64-bit mask, so that the fraction of the last qword can be checked faster.

Here are the possible values that can be returned:  Pass: A value with DataType `dt' will always be compatible with the annotation at run time.
However, it is often used as system time such as in GenericRateLimiter and other places so a port needs to return system time in order to work.
If a C string is compared with an STL string object, we know it's meant to point to a NUL-terminated string, and thus can print it as a string.
If it is non empty, the log files will be in the specified dir, and the db data dir's absolute path will be used as the log file name's prefix.
If set, this expression is being re-type checked as part of diagnostics, / and so we should not visit bodies of non-single expression closures.

Misc stubs for functions which should be defined in the core standard library, but are difficult or impossible to write in Swift at the moment.
Most of the compile-time options are saved with the compiled regex so that they can be inspected during studying (and therefore JIT compiling).

SILVisitor - This is a simple visitor class for Swift SIL nodes, allowing / clients to walk over entire SIL functions, blocks, or instructions.
SQLite expects that the sqlite3_file.pMethods element will be valid after xOpen returns regardless of the success or failure of the xOpen call.
Since this is a template, it will only instantiate cases that are used and thus we still require full coverage of the AST nodes by the visitor.

Sorts and then uniques a container with random access iterators and an erase / method that removes a range specified by random access iterators.
Stubs are not allowed to spill registers to the stack, so the native stack pointer will only be adjusted if the stub code does so intentionally.
The Ptr enum is a lattice that represents the "pointerness" of a type: whether it's a pointer at all, and what kind of location it may point to.
The VM can also send messages to the client via the proxy, either in reponse to messages from the client, or to poll the client for information.

Allocating database file space in large chunks (say 1MB at a time), may reduce file-system fragmentation and improve performance on some systems.
Assumes it can load more words than the size to compare (this is often possible in HPHP when you know you dealing with request-allocated memory).
At this point we are sure that the object we found is of the same type we are looking for, so we downcast it to that type without further checks.
But that compiler magic ended up generating such a flurry of bug reports that we have taken it all out and gone back to using simple noop macros.
COPY_WHEN_ABSOLUTE is 2 under Win32 because by chance both regular absolute paths in the file system and UNC paths need copying of two characters

In the requests executed before reaching this limit, the profile counters are set very high so that no retranslation in optimized mode is triggered.
In this case there is no "blocking connection", so invoking sqlite3_unlock_notify() results in the unlock-notify callback being invoked immediately.
InstantStatic allows defining a static in-class variable that is initialized during program startup, without actually needing to define it anywhere.
It does not add  extra data to the FTS index or require FTS5 to query for multiple terms, so it is efficient in terms of disk space and query speed.
Like / StoredWithTrivialAccessors, accessors have been synthesized / which simply read and write through the addresses returned by / the addressors.
Note that we have to update the LRU list before we increment m_size, so that other threads don't attempt to evict list items before they even exist.
One can customize this greatly by using custom actions at the allocation site (see below), and adding custom annotations to the types being scanned.
Or, if iCol is non-negative but less than the number of columns in the table, set pnToken to the number of tokens in column iCol of the current row.

In particular, deleted and overwritten versions are discarded, and the data is rearranged to reduce the cost of operations needed to access the data.
In these situations, we set up a "strange marker" by calling updateMarker() before the instruction is done (but after the pre-live ActRec is pushed).
It may still call other user-level functions via re-entry (e.g., for destructors and autoload), and it may make calls to builtins using FCallBuiltin.

NewTableReader() is called in three places: (1) TableCache::FindTable() calls the function when table cache miss and cache the table object returned.
Other than the registers passed into Pop, the stack pointer and (possibly) the system stack pointer, these methods do not modify any other registers.

Persistence is possible when a Class is uniquely named and is defined in a pseudomain that has no side-effects (except other persistent definitions).
Providing the ability to disable the optimization allows the older, buggy application code to work without change even with newer versions of SQLite.
Query ** Querying into containers is through the member functions find (for key/value pairs) and get (for array elements), and is in streaming style.

Returns: true if the supplied TypedValue is a Cell, and either has a non-reference counted type, or is a KindOfString that points to a static string.
Returns: whether two TypeConstraints are compatible, in the sense required for PHP inheritance where a method with parameter typehints is overridden.
Some of these methods don't use the RegisterDump argument, but they have to accept them so that they can overload those that take register arguments.
The `destroys_locals' flag indicates whether the call can change locals in the calling frame (e.g. extract() or parse_str(), when called with FCall).
The difference between this and UniversalTersePrint() is that for a (const) char pointer, this prints both the pointer and the NUL-terminated string.
The exception is HNI functions declared with NeedsActRec, which do not have nativeFuncPtr's and have unique builtinFuncPtr's which do all their work.
The keys in the right sub-tree must all be strictly greater than End, because if any key equals End, that node should have been merged into this one.
The pair represents the zero or more instructions to replace the input with, plus the SSATmp* to use instead of the input instruction's dst (if any).
The second argument of DefaultPrintTo() is needed to bypass a bug in Symbian's C++ compiler that prevents it from picking the right overload between:
The value of MATCH_LIMIT determines the default number of times the internal match() function can be called during a single execution of pcre_exec().
This allows multiple schemas to coexist in the same database, which is especially important if multiple versions of hhvm are in use at the same time.
This file defines ScalarTypeInfo, which is a convenient abstract implementation of TypeInfo for working with types that are efficiently scalarizable.
This is a variant of virtual member function NewTableReader function with added capability to disable pre-fetching of blocks on BlockBasedTable::Open
This is here because MSVC decides that StringPiece matches both this overload as well as the FormatValue overload for string-y types in folly itself.
This would leave 4 byte padding hole, though, which some users (e.g. IndexedStringMap) might have a use for, so we expose it as a slot for our users.
Up to max_write_buffer_number write buffers may be held in memory at the same time, so you may wish to adjust this parameter to control memory usage.
Using the CoreFoundation module in the core stdlib would create a circular dependency, so instead we import these declarations as part of SwiftShims.
When this variable is set to a non-null pointer, then the status of the current thread will be updated when a function of ThreadStatusUtil is called.
XXX: vspprintf and spprintf have slightly different semantics and flags than C99 printf (because PHP) so we can't annotate them with ATTRIBUTE_PRINTF

Detect any backedges that are unknown to SILLoopInfo and mark the blocks / that form the head/tail of the backedge as unknown control flow boundaries.
Don't reset the debug scope after leaving the outermost scope, because the debugger is not expecting the function epilogue to be in a different scope.
Emit the fixes computed as part of the solution, returning true if we were / able to emit an error message, or false if none of the fixits worked out.
Every ProxygenTransport is in the list initially, and gets unlinked when it is enqueued or aborted, or destructed if it is never handed to the server.
For reasons that I do not understand, the expression in this GET2 macro is treated by gcc as a signed expression, even when a is declared as unsigned.
Formats log entry severity, provides a stream object for streaming the log message, and terminates the message with a newline when going out of scope.
GO_ARGS is inserted implicitly by the linker for any function that also has a Go prototype and therefore is usually not necessary to write explicitly.
If `at' is "bool", "int", "float", "string", "array", or "resource", then equivDataTypes() can definitively tell us whether or not `dt' is compatible.
If include_memtable is set to true, then the result will also include those recently written data in the mem-tables if the mem-table type supports it.
If the number of expected substrings is small, the wrapper function uses space on the stack, because this is faster than using malloc() for each call.
If we instead put its logic inside the previous CopyArray() function, arrays with different sizes would lead to different copies of the template code.
In addition, extra data belonging to IRInstructions that may be hashed in IRInstrTables must:  - Implement an equals() member that indicates equality.
Insert performance was observed to degrade rapidly when there is a heavy concurrent insert/evict load, mostly due to locks in the underlying TBB::CHM.
It attempts to optimize / for the case of being able to represent as many pointer cases as possible / while allowing for indices to be stored as well.
Iterators cannot store Elm pointers (because it's possible for m_data to change without bumping m_version in some cases), so indices are used instead.
ListColumnFamilies will open the DB specified by argument name and return the list of all column families in that DB through column_families argument.
ManagedIterator is a special type of iterator that supports freeing the underlying iterator and still being able to access the current key/value pair.
Modules will be sychronously instantiated if they haven't already been, potentially blocking both the calling thread and main thread for a short time.
Note / that we still do compile-time availability checking with '*', so the / compiler will still catch references to potentially unavailable symbols.
OVERSEE means that the program should prepare the appropriate environment for a child process to execute the death test, then wait for it to complete.
Pass that walks over the dominator tree and replaces uses of SSATmps that have more-refined versions available with uses of the more refined versions.
Produces the 'natural' SILDeclRef for the given ValueDecl or / AbstractClosureExpr: / - If 'loc' is a func or closure, this returns a Func SILDeclRef.
Remove all entries in this batch (Put, Merge, Delete, PutLogData) since the most recent call to SetSavePoint() and removes the most recent save point.

The implementation of the service request will return the TCA at which to resume execution even if it's another stub rather than the calling function.
The latest point we can move Instruction without moving it over an / instruction that might be able to decrement the value with reference / semantics.
The least valid pointer value for an actual pointer (as opposed to / Objective-C pointers, which may be tagged pointers and are covered / separately).
The reason it must still count its parameter locals is that the caller may or may not pass any of the parameters, regardless of how many are declared.

This is an optimisation used predominantly with RKScrollViews but it is applied recursively to all subviews that have removeClippedSubviews set to YES
This test is here only for compile-time type checking, and has no overhead in an optimized build at run-time, as it will be optimized away completely.
This version includes context information about lower errors arguments: with the macro, the function name, file and lineno are automagically recorded.
Traits that returns the type of the extra C++ data structure for a given instruction, if it has one, along with some other information about the type.
We cannot rely on numeric_limits in STL, as __int64 and long long are not part of standard C++ and numeric_limits doesn't need to be defined for them.

An attempt at getting the results of gdImageTrueColorToPalette to look a bit more like the original (im1 is the original and im2 is the palette version
As a policy matter, we currently define / contexts broadly: a lambda expression in a function is a new / DeclContext, but a new brace statement is not.
Atomically release *mu and block on this condition variable until either a call to SignalAll(), or a call to Signal() that picks this thread to wakeup.

Emit the allocation for a local variable, provides an Initialization / that can be used to initialize it, and registers cleanups in the active / scope.
Flags: - (never set any flags) Note: breakpoint instruction is not supported by all architectures (e.g. ppc) It falls back to SLJIT_NOP in those cases.
For example, / if the primary locator refers to a function argument, the target locator / will be set to refer to the corresponding function parameter.
Given that this is an entry block argument, and given that it does / not correspond to an indirect result, return the corresponding / SILParameterInfo.
Here we add all uses of I to the worklist, replace all uses of I with the new value, then return I, so that the combiner will know that I was modified.
If a value-type (e.g. a struct) contains multiple / references, it is treated as a single "pointer" which may point to any / of the referenced objects.
If multithreaded compaction is being used, each created CompactionFilter will only be used from a single thread and so does not need to be thread-safe.
If none of the above is defined, it will print the debug string of the value if it is a protocol buffer, or print the raw bytes in the value otherwise.
If that edge goes to a block with other predecessors, this function only returns that block if it also dominates the sources of its other predecessors.
If the caller of this function needs to push the stored value on stack, it should set 'incRefNew' so that 'newVal' will have its ref-count incremented.
If this Transaction was created by an OptimisticTransactionDB, calling UndoGetForUpdate can affect whether this key is conflict checked at commit time.
In this situation, we have to be careful not to have every thread simultaneously attempt to evict the extra entries, since we could end up underfilled.
InitExistentialMetatypeInst - Given a metatype reference and a set / of conformances, creates an existential metatype value referencing / the metatype.
It is used after doing a raw copy of the array elements (without manipulating refcounts, as an uncounted won't hold any reference to refcounted values.
It may either have fields that require runtime /   initialization, or be missing requirements at the end for /   which default witnesses are available.
Like constrainGuard(), this returns true iff `tc' is more specific than the existing constraint, and does not constrain the guard if `tc.weak' is true.
Make this object store an independent copy of the out of line / data it currently stores, simply overwriting the current pointer / without deleting it.
Map from associated type requirements to the corresponding substitution, / which captures the replacement type along with any conformances it requires.
NB: We don't apply superclass substitutions to members because we want consistent metadata layout between generic superclasses and concrete subclasses.
NOLINT A compile-time bool constant that is true if and only if x is a null pointer literal (i.e. NULL or any 0-valued compile-time integral constant).
Nested types are handled a bit funny here because a nominal typeref always stores its full mangled name, in addition to a reference to the parent type.
Note that the Context is adjusted to account for the fact that Closure __invoke methods run in the context of a class other than their declaring class.
Note that this may differ from m_funcVecLen, since numMethods() is the exact number of methods, and m_funcVecLen is only required to be an upper bound.
Other kinds of conversion are done in place when it is possible, but sometimes they are not possible and in those cases prior pointers are invalidated.
Perform a flow-sensitive type analysis on a function, using the given Index and Context when we need information about things outside of this function.

Returns the sequence number that is guaranteed to be smaller than or equal to the sequence number of any key that could be inserted into this memtable.
Returns true if this string is "strictly" an integer in the sense of is_strictly_integer from util/hash.h, and if so provides the integer value in res.
Similarly, if loc is PostProp, locName is the name of the property if it was known, and locTy gives as much information about the object type it is in.
Simulating the inlining measures the cost of pushing a dummy frame (or not if we are able to elide it) and any effects that may have on alias analysis.
So in the case that the helper throws an exception, the unwinder will believe it has to decref three normal stack slots (where the pre-live ActRec is).
Starts the JS application from an "bundle", i.e. a JavaScript file that contains code for all modules and a runtime that resolves and executes modules.
Such as when have hit a registered breakpoint (regardless of type), when interrupt forcing is enabled, or when the pc is over an active line breakpoint
The Func class cannot be safely extended, because variable amounts of memory associated with the Func are allocated before and after the actual object.
The first argument is an integer which is 0 to disable FK enforcement, positive to enable FK enforcement or negative to leave FK enforcement unchanged.
The library will internally keep track of the operations, and apply them in the correct order once a base-value (a Put/Delete/End-of-Database) is seen.
These are things that look like constants to PHP, but their values aren't known at compile time and are instead determined per request at startup time.
This allows one to write such a macro on a system that does not support death tests and be sure that it will compile on a death-test supporting system.
This file is designed for caching those frequently used IDs and provide efficient portal (i.e, a set of static functions) to access java code from c++.
This function automatically preserves caller-saved registers so that calling code can use Printf at any point without having to worry about corruption.
This function may only be used to reduce the size of the string, or increase the size of the string to a value in range after a call to appendCursor().
This is a fast version of strlcpy which should be used, if you know the size of the destination buffer and if you know the length of the source string.
Though it has CR and LF characters, a common practice has been to use its NL (0x15) character as the line terminator in C-like processing environments.
Using / NullablePtr is just a convenient way to make sure that we assert if we / attempt to use Region during initialization before the pointer is set.
We don't protect writing to has_owner_ here, as it's the caller's responsibility to ensure that the current thread holds the mutex when this is called.
dropped column families might still be included in this iteration (we're only removing them when client drops the last reference to the column family).
emitDecRef() returns the status flags register that results from the decrement, since callers may want to check the result and invoke data destructors.
methodWrapper() behaves the same as functionWrapper(), but also prepends either an ObjectData* (instance) or Class* (static) argument to the signature.
- Set a maximum allowed space limit for SST files that when reached the DB wont do any further flushes or compactions and will set the background error.
/ - Releases the calling thread's ownership of the read lock /   and synchronizes-with the subsequent successful lock operations on /   the same object.
/ / Note that this is used for imported `void * _Nonnull`, which may include / reinterpret_cast-ed integers, so we only get NULL as an extra inhabitant.
/ / This is flow insensitive since we just add all of the potential / users/decrements in subregions without caring if there is only one along a / path.
/ / When this scope exits, any changes beyond this will be reverted to / bring the graph back to its state prior to the introduction of this / variable.
Alias references are special in that they do not own the object and can therefore safely be converted to and from its corresponding plain JNI reference.
Although we do not currently "hide" the HDF struct implementation, we recommend you use the accessor functions instead of accessing the values directly.
As NetWare LibC has optind and optarg macros defined in unistd.h our local variables were getting mistakenly preprocessed so undeffing optind and optarg
As a result, the construction order of the function static variables can be controlled by properly invoke their first function calls in the right order.

Developers should either implement PartialMergeMulti, or implement PartialMerge which is served as the helper function of the default PartialMergeMulti.
Emit the allocation for a local temporary, provides an / Initialization that can be used to initialize it, and registers / cleanups in the active scope.
Failing to detach from a thread before it exits will cause a crash, as will calling Detach an extra time, and this guard class helps keep that straight.

Generate the filter using the keys that are added The return value of this function would be the filter bits, The ownership of actual data is set to buf
However, this return value does not indicate that there is no more memory (does not set the current error code of the compiler to out-of-memory status).
If the requested page is already in the page cache, then the page cache implementation must return a pointer to the page buffer with its content intact.
If there is no attached database N on the database connection D, or if database N is a temporary or in-memory database, then a NULL pointer is returned.
If you want this yourself in a non-FB build, feel free to define HAVE_LIBBFD and specify the right options to link in libbfd.a in the extra C++ options.
In this case, the type is not quite as constrained / as a dynamic Self, because it is bound to the conforming type, / not the dynamic type of the value.
Make dest directory look identical to src by copying files and directories, without copying identical files (so they keep the same timestamp as before).
Note that the all the pointer options (except table_factory, which will be described in more details below) will be initialized with the default values.
Now that we have type-checked an entire module, perform any type / checking that requires the full module, e.g., Objective-C method / override checking.
Returns the location of the node that introduced this refinement context / or an invalid location if the context reflects the minimum deployment target.
Such containers often using type-punning and other tricks, which means an exact scan will fail to find valid pointers (where as conservative scan will).
The difference from UniversalTersePrint() is that this function prints both the pointer and the NUL-terminated string for a (const or not) char pointer.
The first argument passed to an unlock-notify callback is a pointer to an array of void* pointers, and the second is the number of entries in the array.

This class describes types for working with requirements of generic signatures and the layout of the generic arguments section of generic type metadata.
This executor factory can only create a single executor instance because it moves executorInstance global reference to the executor instance it creates.
This flag specifies that the implementation should optimize the filters mainly for cases where keys are found rather than also optimize for keys missed.
This function returns true and sets the res parameter if arKey is a non-empty string that matches one of the following conditions: 1) The string is "0".
This function will query both this batch and the DB and then merge the results using the DB's merge operator (if the batch contains any merge requests).
This helper template allows PrintTo() for tuples and UniversalTersePrintTupleFieldsToStrings() to be defined by induction on the number of tuple fields.
This is necessary during unwinding because another object being destructed by the unwind may decide to do a debug_backtrace and read a destructed value.
This is ok for private properties for now because we don't ever infer inner-array types on properties, but if that changes new mechanisms may be needed.
This set of constructors act like the normal constructors for the given types except that they do not increment the reference count of the passed value.
Using the Darwin (or Glibc) module in the core stdlib would create a circular dependency, so instead we import these declarations as part of SwiftShims.
When const_iterator is an input iterator but not a forward iterator, this inferred type may not match value_type, and the print output may be incorrect.
does not work, as gcc supports variable-length arrays whose sizes are determined at run-time (this is gcc's extension and not part of the C++ standard).
post_debugger_ret is a similar request that is used when translated code returns from a frame that had its saved return address smashed by the debugger.

For RefDatas in RDS, we need a way to check if they are initialized while avoiding the usual kind assertions (kind will be zero if it's not initialized).
However, notice that the new types may result in inconsistent operand types for instructions that are unreachable (but not yet removed from the IR unit).
If a key is Put/Merge/Deleted after DisableIndexing is called and then is fetched via Get/GetForUpdate/GetIterator, the result of the fetch is undefined.
If the client requires a new compaction filter to be used for different compaction runs, it can specify compaction_filter_factory instead of this option.
If two or more threads call one or more of these routines against the same prepared statement and column at the same time then the results are undefined.
If we have reached the end of either list, visit the rest of the other list, We do not need to worry about duplicates since each array we know is unique.
In particular, the / proxy in this iteration does not read a value and therefore does not create a LocalRef / until one of these other operators is used.
It also has the peculiar (but maybe occasionally useful) property of iteration order matching insertion order as long as you haven't erased anything yet.
Needs to be updated after appending bytes for the key meta_bytes_buf: buffer for extra meta bytes meta_bytes_buf_size: offset to append extra meta bytes.
NotFound if the named file does not exist, the calling process does not have permission to determine whether this file exists, or if the path is invalid.
Note that (as usual) memory locations we haven't assigned bits to may still be affected, but this module only reports effects on locations assigned bits.
Note that we don't track the sizes of stubs anywhere---this code only works because all service requests emit a code segment of size svcreq::stub_size().
Note that when a function is invoked by the runtime via invokeFunc(), the "pre-live" state is skipped and the ActRec is materialized in the "live" state.
Perform a top-down splay operation, attempting to set things up / so that Root is the least upper bound and its left child is the / greatest lower bound.
Property "rocksdb.iterator.is-key-pinned": If returning "1", this means that the Slice returned by key() is valid as long as the iterator is not deleted.
Query guarantees that it will return all elements intersecting the specified bounding box, but it might also return some extra non-intersecting elements.
ROCKSDB_LITE If true, then DB::Open / CreateColumnFamily / DropColumnFamily / SetOptions will fail if options file is not detected or properly persisted.
Returns whether this type has the no override attribute, that is, if it is a final class (explicitly marked by the user or known by the static analysis).
Similar to fcallArrayHelper, but takes an additional arg specifying the total number of args, including the array parameter (which must be the last one).
Since fpOff is given as an offset from the frame pointer as if it were in the normal place on the main stack, we have to reconstruct that "normal place".
Since this is often used as a static global, we want to do anything that might try to access ThreadInfo::s_threadInfo here instead of in the constructor.
Sqlite3_aggregate_context() is normally called once for each invocation of the xStep callback and then one last time when the xFinal callback is invoked.

The CollectedInfo structure can be initialized by the caller to enable collecting some pass-specific types of information (e.g. public static property types).
The Nokia compiler _can_ decide between class template specializations for T and T*, so a tr1::type_traits-like is_pointer works, and we can overload on that.
The meaning of these values is imposed externally by the / type infos, except that it is expected that they will be passed / as arguments in exactly this way.
The result is truncated if / Offset is smaller than a pointer, with an assertion that the / pre-truncation result is a sign extension of the truncated result.

all the cases below (as provided by upstream) define: word as atomic_int_t, and unsigned word as atomic_uint_t and only use volatile atomic_uint_t as atomic_t
scanPtr() is used in the custom scanners because its possible for two types to mutually refer to each other via certain containers (so we need a cycle check).
-- Function attributes (static, abstract, etc) must all make sense, certian attributes are mutually exclusive, others aren't, some imply bytecode restrictions.

If multithreaded compaction is being used, the supplied CompactionFilter instance may be used from different threads concurrently and so should be thread-safe.
If positive, specifies the default wait timeout in milliseconds when a transaction attempts to lock a key if not specified by TransactionOptions::lock_timeout.
If the 3rd parameter is non-negative, then it must be the byte offset into the string where the NUL terminator would appear if the string where NUL terminated.
If the SrcKey points to the last instruction in a function, this will advance past the end of the function, and potentially contain an invalid bytecode offset.
In this way, by maintaining a relatively sparse set of entries in a vector, we can use least upper bound searches on an offset key to find its corresponding T.
It is only for / use in pathways that deal with reporting fatalErrors to avoid the / potential / for recursive fatalErrors that could happen if you used Mutex.
Note:  You should not write or delete anything from the batch directly and should only use the functions in the Transaction class to write to this transaction.
People usually want the fail-fast behavior of FAIL and ASSERT_*, but those writing data-driven tests often find themselves using ADD_FAILURE and EXPECT_* more.

In order to prevent a circular module dependency between the core standard library and the Foundation overlay, we import these declarations as part of SwiftShims.
It relies on type_ being statically initialized to 0 (effectively setting it to kStatic) and on ThreadSafeLazyInit() to lazily initialize the rest of the members.
Note that its usually best to at least start by bisecting with name2 only, since (for some optimizations) skipping earlier optimizations can change later results.
Note: Bottom is a type with no value, and Uninit/InitNull/Nullptr are considered types with a single unique value, so this function returns false for those types.
The RDS starts with a small header that is statically layed out, followed by the main "normal" segment, which is initialized to zero at the start of each request.
The Value must be a trivially copyable and assignable type, and it must be legal to copy from it without synchronization (this table may do this during a rehash).
The more natural way to do this would be to left-recurse, but we have to right-recurse because C++ only lets you pattern-match things off the beginning of a pack.
The second argument specifies a string representing the calling location The third argument, lfname, is the name of the function which will be created and called.
These represent compilation units for the JIT, and are used to key into several runtime structures for finding profiling data or tracking translation information.
This is a variable-sized / structure that describes how to find and parse a generic parameter vector / within the type metadata for an instance of a nominal type.
This is important because gcc is incapable of re-using stack space even for temporary variables, so every EXPECT_EQ reserves stack space for another AssertHelper.
This is mainly for templates (like the standard containers) where we have request heap aware versions and is to prevent people accidently using the standard kind.
This routine is typically called in response to a user action such as pressing "Cancel" or Ctrl-C where the user wants a long query operation to halt immediately.

If the methods in your module need to interact with UIKit methods, they will probably need to call those on the main thread, as most of UIKit is main- thread-only.
In case of collision while inserting, the builder attempts to insert in the next cuckoo_block_size locations before skipping over to the next Cuckoo hash function.
In these cases we represent the / conformance as a null ProtocolConformance* pointer, because there is no / static conformance associated with the conforming type.

The WithNestedExecution version supports commands that cause the server to run PHP on send when we want to be able to debug that PHP before completing the command.
The iterators themselves can find their registered container using their m_container pointer, but arrays must linearly search this table to go the other direction.
The sqlite3_open_v2() interface works like sqlite3_open() except that it accepts two additional parameters for additional control over the new database connection.
Then, when translatePendingCppExceptionToJavaException is called at the topmost level of the native stack, the wrapped Java exception is thrown to the java caller.

These iterators were designed to operate within the foreach() structures provided by the engine, but could be extended for use with other iterative engine opcodes.
These subtypes represent common parameters (e.g., statically known Func, local variable ID, stack offset, etc.) that are useful for a variety of HHIR instructions.
This can be used for validating that assumptions from static analysis are not violated (for example, by unserializing objects with changed private property types).
This file defines IndirectTypeInfo, which is a convenient abstract implementation of TypeInfo for working with types that are always passed or returned indirectly.
To cope with SunOS4 and other systems that lack memmove() but have bcopy(), define a macro for memmove() if HAVE_MEMMOVE is false, provided that HAVE_BCOPY is set.
Used whenever an entity is a child of another entity - does all the work of determining if the object should be written with/without a name and if we need a comma.
We cannot determine these outside the compilation (e.g. by running a program as part of "configure") because PCRE is often cross-compiled for use on other systems.
When using a TransactionDB: If Transaction::SetSnapshot is used, TransactionDB will read either in-memory write buffers or SST files to do write-conflict checking.
Your implementaitn should call invokeFiltersOnClose() before anything else to make sure that any user-provided php_user_filter instances get to flush and clean up.

In addition, it remembers whether it performed the attach or not, so it is safe to nest it with itself or with non-fbjni code that manages the attachment correctly.
In certan case, it is desirable to alter the underlying options when the TableFactory is not used by any open DB by casting the returned pointer to the right class.
In some applications, it would be better to match all instances of "first place" or "1st place" regardless of which form the user specified in the MATCH query text.
It would be abstractly good to allow conversion to a base protocol to be trivial, but it's not clear that there's really a structural guarantee we can rely on here.
Look up a (possibly overloaded) value set at top-level scope / (but with the specified access path, which may come from an import decl) / within the current module.
Note, this is disabled by default because of the need to have an intersection operation in the type system to maintain index invariants---it doesn't quite work yet.
Note: m_maybeRefReturn used to implement an optimization to avoid unbox checks when we call functions where we know no function with that name returns by reference.
One other note: having the interpreter visit blocks when they are unreachable still potentially merges types into object properties that aren't possible at runtime.
Pointer to the array of Class pointers, allocated immediately after `this', which contain this class's inheritance hierarchy (including `this' as the last element).
Rather than depending on error-prone ordered lists or syntactically unpleasant pass-by-reference, we return an object with named parameters (like *_fetch_object()).
Remove all entries in this batch (Put, Merge, Delete, SingleDelete, PutLogData) since the most recent call to SetSavePoint() and removes the most recent save point.
Return a file index range in the next level to search for a key based on smallest and largest key comparison for the current file specified by level and file_index.
Some of the implementations also interact with the VM to setup further notifications, though this is not the only place the debugger interacts directly with the VM.
The ParameterizeTestCaseRegistry class holds a collection of pointers to the ParameterizedTestCaseInfo objects and calls RegisterTests() on each of them when asked.
The following two constructors are primarily for using this with the ArrayData interface (see GlobalsArray), which expects iterators to be represented by a ssize_t.
The iterator returned by NewIterator when this option is set will behave just as if the underlying store did not contain any non-matching keys, with two exceptions.
There are also two supported shortcuts: If ObjFn is a bool, and 'it' is not an array, and not a collection, IterateV will do nothing, and return the value of objFn.
This includes a list of TestPartResults, a list of TestProperties, a count of how many death tests there are in the Test, and how much time it took to run the Test.
This system of day numbering is sometimes referred to as Julian days, but to avoid confusion with the Julian calendar, it is referred to as serial day numbers here.
To access the underlying object of a weak reference, the reference must either be released, or the weak reference can be used to create a local or global reference.
When ConstantProp is on, the types we create here can reflect that we'll be changing bytecode later to actually make these into non-reference-counted SStr or SArrs.
Within vixl, we use SPRegInternalCode to distinguish the stack pointer (to avoid accidentally emitting encodings where the programmer means one and gets the other).
You can define GTEST_HAS_GLOBAL_STRING to 1 to indicate that ::string is available AND is a distinct type to ::std::string, or define it to 0 to indicate otherwise.
a list of all files that we'll consider deleting (every once in a while this is filled up with all files in the DB directory) (filled only if we're doing full scan)

Currently, does not invalidate pointers or references to elements at indexes less than InternalSize, but we don't want to depend on this without documenting it here.
Developers can further specify these three options by casting the return value of TableFactoroy::GetOptions() to BlockBasedTableOptions and making necessary changes.
Earlier conformance / kinds supersede later conformance kinds, possibly with a / diagnostic (e.g., if an inherited conformance supersedes an / explicit conformance).
GTEST_INCLUDE_GTEST_INTERNAL_GTEST_TYPE_UTIL_H_ Due to C++ preprocessor weirdness, we need double indirection to concatenate two tokens when one of them is __LINE__.
HHVM tracks the types that were inferred, and if an unserialize happens that would violate what we've inferred, we'll raise a notice and unserialize() returns false.
If this flag is set for an arithmetic operation, it uses only the lower 32 bit of the input register(s), and set the CPU status flags according to the 32 bit result.
In other words, it is possible to jump to any label from anywhere, even from a code fragment, which is compiled later, if both compiled code shares the same context.
It is caller's responsibility to synchronize the operation, i.e. don't delete the backup when you're restoring from it See also the corresponding doc in BackupEngine
It is initialized YES, then is set to NO in RCTUIManager after the layout pass is done and all frames have been extracted to be applied to the corresponding UIViews.
Keeps track of active selector-based lookups, so that we don't infinitely / recurse when checking whether a method with a given selector has already / been imported.
MArrayIter works by "registering" itself with the array being iterated over, in a way that any array can find out all active MArrayIters associated with it (if any).
Map the given type, which is based on an interface SILFunctionType and may / therefore be dependent, to a type based on the context archetypes of this / SILFunction.
Most users don't need to concern themselves with any of this, as most of the complexity is hidden behind the allocator interface and standard container replacements.
NLBLOCK, PSSTART, and PSEND are defined in the various modules to indicate in which datablock the parameters exist, and what the start/end of string field names are.
Non-anonymous allocations can be created in two ways:  rds::bind(Symbol) uses an RDS-internal link table to find if there is an existing handle for the given symbol.
Note: For boxed values, this will generate a LdRef instruction which takes the given exit trace in case the inner type doesn't match the tracked type for this local.
NullablePtr pointer wrapper - NullablePtr is used for APIs where a / potentially-null pointer gets passed around that must be explicitly handled / in lots of places.
Position at the first key in the source that at or past target The iterator is Valid() after this call iff the source contains an entry that comes at or past target.
Returns Status::Busy if there are read or write conflicts that would prevent us from committing OR if we can not determine whether there would be any such conflicts.
Special case for Timers + ContextExecutor - instead of the default if jsthread then call else dispatch call on jsthread ensure the call is made async on the jsthread
The GNU compiler emits a warning if nested "if" statements are followed by an "else" statement and braces are not used to explicitly disambiguate the "else" binding.
The Message constructor at the end allows the syntax of streaming additional messages into the macro, for compilational compatibility with EXPECT_DEATH/ASSERT_DEATH.
The SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMICnnn values mean that writes of blocks that are nnn bytes in size and are aligned to an address which is an integer multiple of nnn are atomic.

The struct UserIniData should be subclassed to hold data specific to an initialization regime, such as the zend compatibility layer implementation of zend_ini_entry.
The table may be optionally attached to an ActRec, in which case it will contain a kNamedLocalDataType TypedValue per every named local defined in ActRec's function.
There is also a 'data' section containing things like jump tables, floating point constants, and other values that must be directly addressable from translated code.
These are used for contexts where the type you're allocating isn't statically known, and also for allocations before the type-scanning infrastructure is initialized.
They were rewritten by a user so as not to use loops, because in some environments this gives a significant performance advantage, and it seems never to do any harm.
This helper routine for a given block, creates successor edges in between / the block's region and all of the regions associated with the block's / successor blocks.
This is a class which maintains the state of the combiner and simplifies / many operations such as removing/adding instructions and syncing them with / the worklist.
This is a problem as in some cases Google Test is used where exceptions are enabled, and we may want to implement ASSERT_* using exceptions where they are available.
This is useful when you have a call which is initiated from C++-land, and therefore doesn't automatically get a local JNI frame managed for you by the JNI framework.
This is usually a noop, but if the hybrid object is a base class of other classes which register JNI methods, this will get the right type for the registered method.
This parameter has to be compiled but not evaluated by this macro, to ensure that this macro only accepts expressions that a macro such as EXPECT_DEATH would accept.
UnresolvedMemberExpr - This represents '.foo', an unresolved reference to a / member, which is to be resolved with context sensitive type information into / bar.foo.
When merging a vector with a vector, new elements are always appended, and this is also different from operator "+", where existing numeric indices are not modified.
When wchar_t is a typedef, defining an overload for const wchar_t* would cause unsigned short* be printed as a wide string, possibly causing invalid memory accesses.
With this option on, from an empty DB, we make last level the base level, which means merging L0 data into the last level, until it exceeds max_bytes_for_level_base.
getBaseType - Determine the type of the base object provided for the / given overload set, which is only non-null when dealing with an overloaded / member reference.
"kIndexUnknown" and "kIndexUnknownNoPtrs" are special type indices representing an unknown type, with the later being an assertion that the type contains no pointers.
/ / If the pointer appears within a larger aggregate, the 'bits' and 'offset' / arguments can be used to position the inhabitant within the larger integer / constant.

Also note that the simpler approach of overloading IsContainerTest(typename C::const_iterator*) and IsContainerTest(...) doesn't work with Visual Age C++ and Sun C++.
ArgsSizeUnknown is set in Func.argsize to mark all functions whose argument size is unknown (C vararg functions, and assembly code without an explicit specification).
Compute a sequence of moves and swaps that will fill the dest registers in the moves map with their correct source values, even if some sources are also destinations.
Creates a factory of a table property collector that marks a SST file as need-compaction when it observe at least "D" deletion entries in any "N" consecutive entires.
During an active request the session will only write POST data and will do so using the onBody() callback which will perform thread safe writes to an internal buffer.
Finally, if an error occurs with the xTokenize() implementation itself, it may abandon the tokenization and return any error code other than SQLITE_OK or SQLITE_DONE.
If a snapshot has not been set, the transaction guarantees that keys have not been modified since the time each key was first written (or fetched via GetForUpdate()).
If semanticContextWeight isn't modified, a fuzzyMatchWeight of N means that a perfect match is worth the same as the worst possible match N/10 "contexts" ahead of it.
If true, this means that the Slice returned by key() is valid as long as PinnedIteratorsManager::ReleasePinnedIterators is not called and the Iterator is not deleted.
In RocksDB-land, this happens when compacting a database where keys are not randomly distributed across L0 files but nearby keys are likely to be in the same L0 file.
In the unit test, 'Happens After' relationship among sync points could be setup via SyncPoint::LoadDependency, to reproduce a desired interleave of threads execution.
Like the object type id, it is up to the debug parser implementation to decide how to assign these ids, but using the offset in the debug information file is easiest.
Otherwise, either a catch or fault handler was identified and the VM state has been prepared for entry to it, or end of execution was reached and vmpc() will be zero.
PinnedIteratorsManager will be notified whenever we need to pin an Iterator and it will be responsible for deleting pinned Iterators when they are not needed anymore.
Revision 1.8  93/02/19  15:01:26  ian Numerous changes from Guy Harris too numerous to mention but including byte-order independance, fixing "old-style masking", etc.
Set up the stub call frame---which has the same layout as the native call frame (and hence is platform dependent), except not all components are required to be valid.
The `trflags' version side exits to the current offset, and passes extra flags to the service request which can be used while JITing to disable certain optimizations.
The possessification table called "opcode_possessify" in pcre_compile.c must also be updated, and also the tables called "coptable" and "poptable" in pcre_dfa_exec.c.
The referenced data is enough to lay out an aggregate containing a value of the type, but can't uniquely represent the type or perform value witness operations on it.
The region will be broken before the first instruction that attempts to consume an input with an insufficiently precise type, or after most control flow instructions.
The sqlite3_close_v2() interface is intended for use with host languages that are garbage collected, and where the order in which destructors are called is arbitrary.
The type of the operator and / RHS are also set, but the rest of the expression may not be typed / / The LHS should already be type-checked or this will be very slow.
The values between FIRST_AUTOTAB_OP and LAST_AUTOTAB_RIGHT_OP, inclusive, are used in a table for deciding whether a repeated character type can be auto-possessified.
This also mean that if you make a down cast that is invalid there will be no one stopping you and the wrappers currently does not detect this which can cause crashes.
This is an optimization to reduce the likelihood of conflicts that could occur in between the time SetSnapshot() is called and the first write/GetForUpdate operation.
This is used for the ReturnHook to prevent uses of the stack and frame, and for killing stack slots below the re-entry depth for potentially re-entering instructions.
This makes sense for values that are returned +1 from an / instruction, like partial_apply, and therefore must be released on all paths / via strong_release or apply.
To ensure that the offset to the parent class remains the same, we simulate inheritance by placing the parent class below the object instead of using c++ inheritance.
Unions, intersections, and subtractions are all supported, though for implementation-specific reasons certain combinations of specialized types cannot be represented.
When a cmd is setup, or receives an interrupt and determines it is not complete, it will do one of three things to ensure it gets interrupted again in the future:  1.
When returning from a frame that had its m_savedRip smashed by the debugger, the return stub stashes values here to be used after running the appropriate catch trace.
When thread_updater_initialized_ is set to true, this variable will not be updated until this thread_updater_initialized_ is again set to false in UnregisterThread().

A convenience initializer is an initializer that initializes a complete / object by delegating to another initializer (eventually reaching a / designated initializer).
A mapping from imported declarations to their "alternate" declarations, / for cases where a single Clang declaration is imported to two / different Swift declarations.
Additionally, if a new resource is created for a node which itself is attached to a document with no associated resource, a resource will be created for that document.
Also, note that for very small universes, even if the bits are sparse there's a good chance you'll be better off with some kind of bitset than the set version of this.
An alternative might be to memset() owner_ to all zeros, but there's no guarantee that a zero'd pthread_t is necessarily invalid or even different from pthread_self().
Before returning the pointer, this increments the population count---the caller must make some change to this element to cause its first uint64_t bytes to be non-zero.
Different from the usual thread-local-storage, ThreadLocalPtr has the ability to distinguish data coming from different threads and different ThreadLocalPtr instances.
Essentially this is a per-thread memory region, along with an internal dynamic link table to give the segment the same layout for each thread as new data is allocated.
FCGI parameters Modified properties These paramaters are also passed as FCGI_PARAMS but require modifications which cause them to differ from their original parameters
Given a memory location and a map between the expansions of the location / and their corresponding values, try to come up with a single SILValue this / location holds.
If a branch is taken or an exception is thrown, the supplied callback is used to indicate when/where the state referenced in the Interp structure should be propagated.
If the same value is passed to multiple invocations of the same SQL function during query execution, under some circumstances the associated metadata may be preserved.
If true, then rocksdb is currently slowing-down all writes to prevent creating too many Level 0 files as compaction seems not able to catch up the write request speed.
If we're creating assert types with options.InsertAssertions, we need to keep track of which array types exist in the whole program in order to include it in the repo.
InlineSkipList is derived from SkipList (skiplist.h), but it optimizes the memory layout by requiring that the key storage be allocated through the skip list instance.
It is very easy to implement a stack data structure, since the growth ratio can be added to the current limit, and sljit_stack_resize will do all the necessary checks.
Note that adding a new element with the next available integer key may fail, in which case ret is set to point to the lval blackhole (see lvalBlackHole() for details).
Note: it is fine to continue to reuse one AliasAnalysis structure after mutating the IR, because the information it contains is both flow-insensitive and conservative.
Otherwise, if `this' is not an interface, the classVec check will determine whether it's an instance of cls (including the case where this and cls are the same trait).
Run-time limits are intended for use in applications that manage both their own internal database and also databases that are controlled by untrusted external sources.
SubstitutedType - A type that has been substituted for some other type, / which implies that the replacement type meets all of the requirements of / the original type.
The SQLite core has no knowledge of its size or internal structure and never deals with the sqlite3_pcache object except by holding and passing pointers to the object.
The collating function must return an integer that is negative, zero, or positive if the first string is less than, equal to, or greater than the second, respectively.
The dynamic semantics are that evaluates / the variable bindings from the capture list, then evaluates the / subexpression (the closure itself) and returns the result.
The functions in this section are responsible for encoding and decoding Ops to and from bytecode streams, and should be the only pieces of code that know how to do so.
The reason is that C++ injects the name of a class as a member of the class itself (e.g. you can refer to class iterator as either 'iterator' or 'iterator::iterator').
This can be thought of as an RPO on the CFG of Func starting from a virtual empty "entry" block, with edges to each DV entry point and an edge to the main entry point.
This file defines the SILVTable class, which is used to map dynamically dispatchable class methods and properties to their concrete implementations for a dynamic type.
This is not an opcode, but is used to check that tables indexed by opcode are the correct length, in order to catch updating errors - there have been some in the past.
Thus, when the reference is destructed, the plain JNI reference, i.e. the underlying JNI reference (like the parameters passed directly to JNI functions), is released.
/ / Generally well-suited for when the reference may be dynamically / initialized, but will only refer to objects within the linkage unit / when statically initialized.
/ / The result of simplification is a constraint system that consisting of / only simple constraints relating type variables to each other or / directly to fixed types.

/ Semantically, however, it serves only as grouping parentheses and / does not form an expression of tuple type (unless the sub-expression / has tuple type, of course).
A note on the so-called "pseudo" type:  For various reasons, including efficiency, the type parser may not find every single type defined in a file's debug information.
A resumable wait handle is a wait handle that represents asynchronous execution of PHP code that can be resumed once the result of awaited WaitHandle becomes available.
Construct AsioExternalThreadEvent  Subclass may optionally pass a PHP object (usually defined by extension) that can be accessed during unserialize() via getPrivData().

If php_http_should_keep_alive() in the on_headers_complete or on_message_complete callback returns true, then this will be should be the last message on the connection.
Increment the strong retain count of an object which may have been / deallocated, aborting if it has been deallocated, and decrement its / weak/unowned reference count.
It is recommended that when a database filename actually does begin with a ":" character you should prefix the filename with a pathname such as "./" to avoid ambiguity.
Normally points to an Opcode, but has type const uchar* because during a given instruction it is incremented while decoding immediates and may point to arbitrary bytes.
Note that NULL termination is needed even for a binary string, because String class only wraps such a "safe" one that can work with any functions that takes a C-string.
Or, if iCol is non-negative but less than the number of columns in the table, return the total number of tokens in column iCol, considering all rows in  the FTS5 table.
RCTProfile  This file provides a set of functions and macros for performance profiling  NOTE: This API is a work in progress, please consider carefully before using it.
Returns true iff `t' is specific enough to fit `tc', meaning a consumer constraining a value with `tc' would be satisfied with `t' as the value's type after relaxation.
The `kills' set is an additional alias class of locations that cannot be read after the return, which is used to provide the range of stack that can be considered dead.
The sljit_emit_enter function emits the necessary instructions for setting up a new context for the executable code and moves function arguments to the saved registers.
There is no compile time mechanism for doing this, but by putting them in the same section as some other, referenced function in the same file, we can keep them around.
These operations are allowed to change the instructions themselves, provided they still behave appropriately (e.g., a fallthrough jmp can be smashed to a nop sequence).
This is a set of callbacks / following the Visitor pattern for the various JobAction subclasses, which / returns an executable name and arguments for the Job to be run.

Visit all the slots and pre-live ActRecs on a live eval stack, handling FPI regions and resumables correctly, and stopping when we reach the supplied activation record.
We do two special-case optimizations to partially inline 'singleton' accessor functions (functions that just return a static local or static property if it's not null).
When using methods (2) or (3), it is important that the tokenizer only provide synonyms when tokenizing document text (method (2)) or query text (method (3)), not both.

it guarantees that there is no column family with id greater than or equal to the returned value in the current running instance or anytime in RocksDB instance history.
number of times bloom was checked before creating iterator on a file, and the number of times the check was useful in avoiding iterator creation (and thus likely IOPs).
(This is making use of the x64 property that "canonical form" addresses have all their upper bits the same as bit 47, and that this is zero for linux userland pointers.)

1 second If positive, specifies the wait timeout in milliseconds when writing a key OUTSIDE of a transaction (ie by calling DB::Put(),Merge(),Delete(),Write() directly).
A variable environment consists of the locals for the current function (either pseudo-main, global function, or method), plus any variables that are dynamically defined.
After an OOM fatal, the memory manager refuses to raise another OOM error until this flag has been reset, to try to avoid getting OOMs during the initial OOM processing.
Cuckoo-hash is a closed-hash strategy, in which all key/value pairs are stored in the bucket array itself intead of in some data structures external to the bucket array.
External dictionary ** During query processing, you can also pass a call-back function, so the search will first try to check if the key string exists in the dictionary.
Fast replacement of a value v1 with a second value v2 guaranteeing that / v2 is placed into the same array index as v1, just deleting v1 if v2 is / already in the array.
Given an existential metatype, / "opens" the existential by returning a pointer to a fresh / archetype metatype T.Type, which also captures the (dynamic) / conformances.
If `inst' does not represent the correct smashable instruction, the _target() routines will return nullptr, and the remaining routines will produce unspecified behavior.
If its an array or a collection, the ArrayData is passed to preArrFn, which can do any necessary setup, and as with preCollFn can return true to bypass any further work.
If set to 1, then all write buffers are flushed to L0 as individual files and this increases read amplification because a get request has to check in all of these files.
If the ReadOptions.read_tier is set to do a read-only fetch, then value_found will be set to false if it cannot be determined whether this value exists without doing IO.
If the caller is holding an active db snapshot, we know that no key could have existing after this snapshot (since we do not compact keys that have an earlier snapshot).
If this transaction was created by an OptimisticTransactionDB(), Status::Busy() may be returned if the transaction could not guarantee that there are no write conflicts.
In addition, a non-nullptr debuggerReturnSP is used as the flag to endCatchHelper that it should perform a REQ_POST_DEBUGGER_RET rather than resuming the unwind process.
In principle, people compiling for non-Windows, non-Unix-like (i.e. uncommon, special-purpose environments) might want to stick other stuff in front of exported symbols.
InVarOrLetPattern has this value when parsing a pattern in which bound / variables are implicitly immutable, but allowed to be marked mutable by / using a 'var' pattern.
Instance variable offsets are kept in fields in metadata, and / the offsets of those fields within the metadata must be loaded / from "indirect offset" global variables.
It can also be used by generic specialization and existential devirtualization passes to promote witness_method and protocol_method instructions to static function_refs.
It takes ownership of the plain JNI reference so be sure that no one else owns the reference when you adopt it, and make sure that you know what kind of reference it is.
Maps certain instructions dealing with locals to the source of the local's type coming into the instruction: usually either a guard or the last known value of the local.
NominalType - Represents a type with a name that is significant, such that / the name distinguishes it from other structurally-similar types that have / different names.
Or the implementation might recognize that a database file will be doing page-aligned sector reads and writes in a random order and set up its I/O subsystem accordingly.
ProxyOriginRaw and ProxyPercentageRaw may be mutated by background threads and should only be read or written using the helper functions defined with HttpRequestHandler.
Sessions decode and encode FastCGI records to facilitate communication between the webserver and the FastCGITransport (which in turn is responsible for managing the VM).

The bridge initializes any registered RCTBridgeModules automatically, however if you wish to instantiate your own module instances, you can return them from this method.
The default shift of -1 indicates that the move instruction will calculate an appropriate 16-bit immediate and left shift that is equal to the 64-bit immediate argument.
The intention is to provide a uniform interface over the most common operations that are used within PHP itself, rather than a complete API for all memory mapping needs.
The reason this exists is because certain functions on the index may cause it to need to consult information in the bodies of functions other than the Context passed in.
This function is to help users can determine: if they want to iterate all keys prefixing `prefix`, whetherit is safe to use prefix bloom filter and seek to key `prefix`.
This is necessary when pushing or otherwise adding things to the stack, to satisfy the AAPCS64 constraint that the memory below the system stack pointer is not accessed.
This is used when receiving a response to a HEAD request which may contain 'Content-Length' or 'Transfer-Encoding: chunked' headers that indicate the presence of a body.
This will / be null for top-level types or local types, and for non-generic types / will simply be the same as the declared type of the declaration context / of TheDecl.
TransactionDBMutex and TransactionDBCondVar APIs allows applications to implement custom mutexes and condition variables to be used by a TransactionDB when locking keys.
We can assume that the pinned flag isn't set unless the refcount is nonzero, and or'ing it in gives us a more efficient mask: the check just becomes "is newval nonzero".
We can't (easily) remove items from m_expQueue, so if we add a new entry every time an item is updated we could end up with a lot of copies of the same key in the queue.
When a cleanup (non-side-exiting) catch trace is executing, this will point to the currently propagating exception, to be passed to _Unwind_Resume at the end of cleanup.
gdcache.h  Caches of pointers to user structs in which the least-recently-used element is replaced in the event of a cache miss after the cache has reached a given size.
isDerivedClassSelfOnly - Return true if this memory object is the 'self' / of a derived class init method for which we can assume that all ivars / have been initialized.

"rocksdb.dbstats" - returns a multi-line string with general database stats, both cumulative (over the db's lifetime) and interval (since the last retrieval of kDBStats).
/ / For a given nested type name, there may be multiple potential archetypes / corresponding to different associated types (from different protocols) / that share a name.
/ / In the case of LSLocation, the base represents the base of the allocated / objects and the ProjectionPath tells which field in the object the / LSLocation represents.
/ / This type is defined by the AST library because it must be capable / of appearing in secondary positions, e.g. within tuple and / function parameter and result types.
After a value reaches its TTL, it's considered "expired", and most operations on the table will act like it's not present (exceptions to this should be documented below).
For this reason, and also to make the code easier to maintain, the storing and loading of offsets from the byte string is now handled by the macros that are defined here.
Generally you should be able to figure out if your key is a pure string (not-integer-like) or not when using ArrayInit, and if not you should probably use toKey yourself.
If a node is "computed" and the constraint passed from above is identical to the constraint used to perform the last computation, we skip laying out the subtree entirely.
Immediates are always treated as sign-extended values, but it's often convenient to use unsigned types, so we allow it with an implicit implementation-defined conversion.
In addition, generating the scanner functions after the final executable is produced provides certain advantages (such as having the final relocated addresses available).
Loads a set of networks from configuration, then is used to test candidate addresses to see if they fall into one of the forbidden networks for a particular request type.
Macros in this section tell Google Test what kind of environment it is being used in, such that Google Test can provide environment-specific features and implementations.
Note / that this is not state kept as part of SolverState, so it only supports / function attributes that need to be set invariant of the actual typing of / the solution.
Say that token is in fact "first", so that when the user inserts the document "I won 1st place" entries are added to the index for tokens "i", "won", "first" and "place".
Stop profiling and return a JSON string of the collected data - The data returned is compliant with google's trace event format - the format used as input to trace-viewer
Such explicit ImplicitCast_s are necessary in surprisingly many situations where C++ demands an exact type match instead of an argument type convertable to a target type.
The FPI Region protects the range of instructions that execute with the partial activation on the stack, which is the instruction after FPush* up to and including FCall*.
The collection of following routines wrap the representation difference in / between the self substitution being first, but the self parameter of a / function being last.
The following functions are used to get a count of the number of bytes used by the different kind of objects that can be stored via APC in the ConcurrentTableSharedStore.
The maximum cells for a function includes all its locals, all cells for its iterators, all temporary eval stack slots, and all cells it pushes for ActRecs in FPI regions.
The relative relocations we form to metadata aren't valid in ELF shared objects, and leaving them relocatable at load time defeats the purpose of the relative references.
The thread-local cached ThreadStatusUpdater that caches the thread_status_updater_ of the first Env that uses any ThreadStatusUtil function other than UnregisterThread().
This excludes litstrs that are instead found in the global table---thus, it is not a source of truth for the number of litstrs a Unit needs, only those it happens to own.
This is the amount of "slack" in stack usage checks - if the stack pointer gets within this distance from the end (minus overhead), throw an infinite recursion exception.
This was part of a project aimed at improving performance by doing the fixup in advance, i.e. eagerly -- the benefits turned out to be marginal or negative in most cases.
WARNING: Under certain (very uncommon) conditions, we may find that external information (e.g., from static analysis) conflicts with the instruction stream we have built.
We do not anticipate changes to experimental interfaces but reserve the right to make minor changes if experience from use "in the wild" suggest such changes are prudent.
When a parameterized test case is instantiated with a particular generator, Google Test creates and runs tests for each element in the sequence produced by the generator.

Right now we have a static maximum number of tracked locations---passes using information from this module must be conservative about locations that aren't assigned an id.
The canonical example of this behavior is the FCall instruction, so we use "non-call control flow" to describe the set of CF instruction that do not exhibit this behavior.
There is no need to encode them, since all browsers support UTF-8 natively, and we are ok to send out UTF-8 encoding characters without turning them into printable ASCIIs.
These restrictions make it more likely that / the view will be "pinned" rather than copied (for example, the VM may / suspend garbage collection within a critical region).
This function must be called anywhere the interpreter does something that could change the type of public static properties named `name' on classes of type `cls' to `val'.

This value represents the maximum number of threads that will concurrently perform a compaction job by breaking it into multiple, smaller ones that are run simultaneously.
max_nesting_level: Same as in php5 xdebug, except that the default value has been changed to 0, from 100 in order to prevent the profiler from being automatically enabled.
visitOperands visits all operands of the given instruction, calling visitor.imm(), visitor.use(), visitor.across(), and visitor.def() as defined in the VASM_OPCODES macro.

And because a hash function has to both distribute good _and_ has to be very fast to compute, those few numbers should be preferred and seems to be the reason why Daniel J.
Before translating/processing each bytecode instruction, the driver of the irgen module calls this function to move to the next bytecode instruction (`newSk') to translate.
CAPI3REF: Obtain Aggregate Function Context METHOD: sqlite3_context  Implementations of aggregate SQL functions use this routine to allocate memory for storing their state.
If a ResourceData is a mix of request allocated data members and globally allocated data members, sweep() has to be overwritten to only free the globally allocated members.
If so, we disallow recovering from the E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR we raise if you violate a return typehint, because doing so would allow violating assumptions from the optimizer.
If the operand of the BindOptionalExpr / evaluates to a missing value, the OptionalEvaluationExpr / immediately completes and produces a missing value in the result / type.
If this write would cross one or more preallocation blocks, determine what the last preallocation block necesessary to cover this write would be and Allocate to that point.
In addition, an uppercase "T" character MUST be used to separate date and time, and an uppercase "Z" character MUST be present in the absence of a numeric time zone offset.
Introduce a loop-escape edge from the exiting regions that associates /   the specific successor number of the region with the loop successor edge /   that we just created.
It does not check for overflow/underflow, in which case the return value becomes different from strtoll(3c) that sets the result to LLONG_MAX/LLONG_MIN and errno to ERANGE.
It is used in IRBuilder::constrain*() functions to determine how to constrain the typeParam and src values of Check instructions, and the src values of Assert instructions.
It may not exist, and we may not be able to create one, which is only guaranteed if the loop starts with an ExitPlaceholder instruction (optionally preceded by a DefLabel).

Support for collecting a set of generic requirements, both explicitly stated and inferred, and computing the archetypes and required witness tables from those requirements.
The IndirectFixup record stores an offset to the saved frame pointer *two* levels deeper in C++, that says where the return IP for the call to the shared stub can be found.
The SQLITE_IOCAP_SAFE_APPEND value means that when data is appended to a file, the data is appended first then the size of the file is extended, never the other way around.
The enumeration type should map to a distinct type, but we don't / know the intended semantics of the enum constants, so conservatively / map them to independent constants.
This / is just for debugging purposes --- e.g. the destructor asserts / that it's true --- but is otherwise derivable from / RemainingArgsForCallee, at least between calls.
This is not an optimal solution This value is in principle a constexp, but the integer-to-pointer cast would require a reinterpret cast, which is not allowed in a constexpr
Type data may be cached concretely, meaning that it was already fully computed, or abstractly, meaning that we remember how to recreate it but haven't actually done so yet.
Using the  built-in tokenizers, the FTS5 query 'first + place' will match instances of "first place" within the document set, but not alternative forms such as "1st place".
Writer* leader:         From EnterAsBatchGroupLeader Writer* last_writer:    Value of out-param of EnterAsBatchGroupLeader Status status:          Status of write operation
symmetric cases for Prev() and SeekToLast() We sometimes also skip entries of more recent updates than the snapshot we read from, but they are not included in this counter.
/ / Normal typedef-name declarations imported into Swift will maintain / equality between the imported declaration's underlying type and the / import of the underlying type.
Additionally we consider a pending call to onComplete() from a currently open transport a pending event as the transport may try to call us to write data until it completes.
Also aligns the file position indicator to the start of the next block by reading the rest of the data from the EOF position to the end of the block that was partially read.
ColumnFamilySet has interesting thread-safety requirements CreateColumnFamily() or RemoveColumnFamily() -- need to be protected by DB mutex AND executed in the write thread.
Default is 4mb, which is reasonable to reduce random IO as well as prevent overallocation for mounts that preallocate large amounts of data (such as xfs's allocsize option).
FastCGISession has an absurd number of callbacks to handle asynchronous reading and writing on its socket, and communication with the FastCGITransport that runs the request.
Find the address of the stored value corresponding to the / smallest key larger than the given one, or return a null pointer / if the key is larger than anything in the map.
For example, if the comparator ignores trailing spaces, it would be incorrect to use a FilterPolicy (like NewBloomFilterPolicy) that does not ignore trailing spaces in keys.
Given a Class that is assumed to be a concrete, regular (not a trait or interface), pure PHP class, and an allocation size, return a new, uninitialized object of that class.
If it is empty, the log files will be in the same dir as data, dbname is used as the data dir by default If it is non empty, the log files will be in kept the specified dir.
If we introduce such a thing, we will / need a new instruction that a frontend can use to introduce aliasing / relationships when TBAA would say that aliasing can not occur.
In SQLite version 3.5.0 and 3.5.1, it was possible to define the SQLITE_OMIT_MEMORY_ALLOCATION which would cause the built-in implementation of these routines to be omitted.
Initializes this structure so rpoBlocks contains the func's blocks according to rpoSortAddDVs(), each bdata entry has an rpoId index, and all block states are uninitialized.
Note that even if the string/array is already uncounted but not static, we still have to make a copy, as we have no idea about the lifetime of the other uncounted item here.
Note that for memory usage inside Cache class, we will only report the usage of the input "cache_set" without including those Cache usage inside the input list "dbs" of DBs.
Once the session calls onBodyComplete() it will not make any further calls to the transport, though it will remain available to receive calls to onStdOut() and onComplete().
Return true iff this Vunit needs register allocation before it can be emitted, either because it uses virtual registers or contains instructions that must be lowered by xls.
Returns column family handle for the selected column family REQUIRES: use this function of DBImpl::column_family_memtables_ should be under a DB mutex OR from a write thread
The following special properties are used only in XCLASS items, when POSIX classes are specified and PCRE_UCP is set - in other words, for Unicode handling of these classes.
The polarity of these bits is chosen so that, when doing struct layout, the flags of the field types can be mostly bitwise-or'ed together to derive the flags for the struct.
The second long contains a gs-relative index to a pointer to the block of memory containing the thread-local, and the third long contains the offset to it within that block.
These checks are needed when an FPush* instruction is in a different region from its FCall, and we don't know statically whether the callee will want arguments by reference.
This is necessary for correctness in a number of cases---e.g., toplevel functions defined in the pseudomain need to be available before the line where the definition occurs.
Those offsets need to be guaranteed to be in ascending order so the keys they are pointing to are also in ascending order to make sure we can use them to do binary searches.
To do this in C, we need to do signed promotion to get the sign extension, but we need to perform arithmetic on unsigned values, since signed overflow is undefined behavior.
relaxConstraint returns the least specific TypeConstraint 'tc' that doesn't prevent the intersection of knownType and relaxType(toRelax, tc.category) from satisfying origTc.
setRaw() assigns a value to the specified key in this Map, but doesn't check for an immutable buffer and doesn't increment m_version, so it's only safe to use in some cases.
where pred_format is a function or functor that takes n (in the case of ASSERT_PRED_FORMATn) values and their source expression text, and returns a testing::AssertionResult.
- simplification pass  After the preOptimize pass, IRBuilder calls out to Simplifier to perform state-independent optimizations, like copy propagation and strength reduction.
/ / It must have been returned by swift_allocObject and the strong reference / must have the RC_DEALLOCATING_FLAG flag set, but otherwise the object is / in an unknown state.
/ / Note that a nullary Objective-C attribute may represent either a / selector for a zero-parameter function or some other Objective-C / entity, such as a class or protocol.
/ / The depth of the BindOptionalExpr indicates which / OptionalEvaluationExpr is completed, in case the BindOptionalExpr / is contained within more than one such expression.
/ / There is one major risk with (3): naively implemented, a single / function value which undergoes many coercions could build up a / linear number of re-abstraction thunks.
/ / This value is cached but is not serialized, because it is a property / of the definition of the constructor that is useful only to semantic / analysis and SIL generation.
/ / Various places in the AST keep track of the generation numbers at which / their own information is valid, such as the list of extensions associated / with a nominal type.
/ Indicates that a memory location is uninitialized at / this point and needs to be initialized by the end of the function and before / any escape point for this instruction.
A concurrent reader that observes the new value of max_height_ will see either the old value of new level pointers from head_ (nullptr), or a new value set in the loop below.
A pathname with multiple consecutive separators may occur either through user error or as a result of some scripts or APIs that generate a pathname with a trailing separator.
An iterator that filters and transforms the results of an / underlying forward iterator based on a transformation from the underlying / value type to an optional result type.
Because all constants defined in hhvm programs create a process-lifetime string for the constant name, this module also manages a mapping from constant names to rds::Handles.
CAPI3REF: Setting The Result Of An SQL Function METHOD: sqlite3_context  These routines are used by the xFunc or xFinal callbacks that implement SQL functions and aggregates.
ClassMethodInst - Given the address of a value of class type and a method / constant, extracts the implementation of that method for the dynamic / instance type of the class.
Create some short-hand type aliases for sparse-id-containers using pointers to IR datastructures, where the ids are extracted from pointer types (IRInstruction* and SSATmp*).
Get the FilterBitsReader, which is ONLY used for full filter block It contains interface to tell if key can be in filter The input slice should NOT be deleted by FilterPolicy
However, in the final pass, other threads might be optimizing a callee's bytecode and changing it, so we should not be reading from it to perform type inference concurrently.
However, we cannot cast it to const void* directly, even using reinterpret_cast, as earlier versions of gcc (e.g. 3.4.5) cannot compile the cast when p is a function pointer.
In an basic scenario where a client is debugging a remote VM, the VM will create a proxy when the client connects (via DebuggerServer) and listen for commands via this proxy.
In builtins, m_fp points to the caller's frame if called through FCallBuiltin, else it points to the builtin's frame, in which case, getPrevVMState() gets the caller's frame.
Internally the family of APC entities (all APCXXXX classes, e.g. APCString, APCArray, ...) embed the handle and provide an API to return the instance from the handle pointer.
NOTE: Our practice here is to set all the thread operation properties and stage before we set thread operation, and thread operation will be set in std::memory_order_release.
On platforms we care about, consume is no more expensive than relaxed, so there's no reason to branch here (and LLVM isn't smart enough to eliminate it when it's not needed).
Otherwise, / if the Clang type is not itself a declaration context (for / example, a typedef that comes into Swift as a strong type), / the type declaration will be provided.
Pointer values with / bits from this mask set are reserved by the ObjC runtime and cannot be / used for Swift value layout when a reference type may reference ObjC / objects.

Return whether two DataTypes for primitive types are "equivalent" as far as user-visible PHP types are concerned (i.e. ignoring different types of strings, arrays, or nulls).
The purpose of ZArrVal is to give us a way to intercept certain uses Z_ARRVAL so that we can make a copy of the array when appropriate so that PHP5 extensions work correctly.
The source of this conformance entry , which is either a / DeclContext (for an explicitly-specified conformance) or a / link to the conformance that implied this conformance.
These registers should not be used for scratch purposes between tracelets, and have to be specially handled if we are returning to the interpreter or invoking the translator.
This function is optionally called internally from the web request thread to retrieve result of the operation after markAsFinished() was called to signal the result is ready.
This leads to O(n) And we need / to run every function through the a sequence of function passes which might / invalidate the functions and make the computed list incomplete.
This will instantiate tests in test case AnimalTest each one with the parameter values tuple("cat", BLACK), tuple("cat", WHITE), tuple("dog", BLACK), and tuple("dog", WHITE):
Unlike ArrayData::size(), this function doesn't delegate to the vsize() function, so its more efficient to use this when you know you don't have a GlobalsArray or ProxyArray.
annotCompat() takes a DataType (`dt') and tries to determine if a value with DataType `dt' could be compatiable with a given AnnotType (`at') and class name (`annotClsName').
/ / Generally well-suited for when C compatibility is a must, dynamic / initialization is the dominant case, or the runtime performance / of accesses is an overriding concern.
/ / Note: when a generic declaration is nested inside a generic function, the / generic parameters of the outer function do not appear in the inner type's / generic signature.
/ / The canonical form of a protocol composition type is based on a sorted (by / module and name), minimized (based on redundancy due to protocol / inheritance) protocol list.
/ / This function requires a valid unbound generic type with the correct / number of generic arguments given, whereas applyGenericArguments emits / diagnostics in those cases.
/ / This name should only be used for debugging dumps and other / developer aids, and should never be part of a diagnostic or exposed / to the user of the compiler in any way.
/ Furthermore, take-initializing a buffer from a buffer is just a / memcpy of the buffer (-1), and take-assigning a buffer from a / buffer is just a destroy and a memcpy (-1).
A relative reference can only be symbolic if the object actually has a symbol at runtime, which may require exporting many internal symbols that would otherwise be strippable.
By inheriting OpaqueNSError, the SwiftError structure reserves enough space within itself to lazily emplace an NSError instance, and gets Core Foundation's refcounting scheme.
CollectionUpcastConversionExpr - Convert a collection whose / elements have some type T to the same kind of collection whose / elements have type U, where U is a subtype of T.
Currently all allocation and deallocation is done eagerly, therefore the performance of the module is dependent on accurately detecting unreachable functions and translations.
GTEST_HAS_DEATH_TEST This macro is used for implementing macros such as EXPECT_DEATH_IF_SUPPORTED and ASSERT_DEATH_IF_SUPPORTED on systems where death tests are not supported.
If "property" is a valid property understood by this DB implementation (see Properties struct above for valid options), fills "*value" with its current value and returns true.
If so, we disallow recovering from the E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR we raise if you violate a parameter typehint, because doing so would allow violating assumptions from the optimizer.
If the RepoAuthType carries strings, they are stored as Id's, and how to look up the Id depends on whether we're pulling it out of a UnitEmitter or a Unit, so it's overloaded.
If the Type is able to support the specialization (i.e., supports() returns true for the corresponding SpecKind), but no specialization is present, Spec::Top will be returned.
If you have small UI component, it's often easier to configure it in a test and compare an image of the view to a reference image that write lots of complex layout-code tests.
In order to catch the mistake of putting tests that use different test fixture classes in the same test case, we need to assign unique IDs to fixture classes and compare them.
It is stored globally instead of inside DB is to avoid the situation where DB is closing while GetThreadList function already get the pointer to its CopnstantColumnFamilyInfo.
It is used to transfer context between MCGenerator::translate() and MCGenerator::finishTranslation() when the initial phase of translation can be done without the write lease.
Major reason for this is because the original get_next_char() bothers me, sacrificing performance for some character sets that people rarely used or that people shouldn't use.
Otherwise, any Get() will search "level" first, and will likely return an old/stale value for the key, since it always searches in increasing order of level to find the value.

Returns a pointer to the Initialization that the current expression should / store its result to, or null if the expression should allocate temporary / storage for its result.
The SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE flag, when paired with the  SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE, is used to indicate that file should always be created, and that it is an error if it already exists.
The client of this package should switch to a new name whenever the comparator implementation changes in a way that will cause the relative ordering of any two keys to change.
The only exceptions are SLJIT_IMOV and SLJIT_IMOVU (SLJIT_MOV_SI/SLJIT_MOVU_SI with SLJIT_INT_OP flag) which can convert any source argument to SLJIT_INT_OP compatible result.
The session and transport borrow the server's thread-pool, however, with the exception of the acceptor, none of the other FastCGI classes communicate with the server directly.
This allows branch to return an SSATmp* that is only defined in the next branch, without letting it escape into the caller's scope (most commonly used with things like LdMem).
This is / really less interesting than keeping a stash of all of the reference / counted values that we have seen and computing their last post dominating / consumed argument.
This operation may fail many times if there are other / contending threads, but eventually the head pointer is set to the new / link that already points to the old head value.
raise_typehint_error() is the same as raise_recoverable_error(), except when compiled in RepoAuthoritative mode with HardTypeHints the error handler is not allowed to recover.
retranslate_opt(SrcKey target, TransID transID)  A request to retranslate a function entry `target', leveraging profiling data to produce a larger, more optimized translation.
/ / When a conformance is ultimately instantiated from a GenericWitnessTable, / this value must be greater than or equal to the GenericWitnessTable's / WitnessTableSizeInWords.
/ / When the context into which a declaration will be imported matches / a Clang declaration context (the common case), the result will be / expressed as a declaration context.
/ If at least one of the pointers refers to a local object and the / connection-graph-nodes of both pointers do not point to the same content / node, the pointers do not alias.
/ Returns a ParenType instead if there is exactly one element which / is unlabeled and not varargs, so it doesn't accidentally construct / a tuple which is impossible to write.
By overriding  system calls with functions under its control, a test program can simulate faults and error conditions that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to induce.
Compute the subsequence relation in between LHS and RHS which tells the / user whether or not the two sequences are unrelated, equal, or if one is a / subsequence of the other.
DebuggerClient is consulted at the beginning of the parsing of various DeclKinds to see whether the decl should be parsed in the global context rather than the current context.
If WAL_ttl_seconds is not 0 and WAL_size_limit_MB is 0, then WAL files will be checked every WAL_ttl_secondsi / 2 and those that are older than WAL_ttl_seconds will be deleted.
MSVC's Preprocessor is completely idiotic, so we have to play by its rules and forcefully expand the variadic args so they aren't all interpreted as the first argument to func.
Normally it's not ok to modify the return value of getValueRef, but the whole point of mutable array iteration is that this is allowed, so this const_cast is not actually evil.
Note that php5 xdebug doesn't distinguish internally between this and a conditional breakpoint (which is in the spec) The encoded condition is kept around for display purposes.
Of course the last two scratch registers (R2 and R3) from this four will be saved on the stack, because they are defined as saved registers in the application binary interface.
The `initial_opt' argument performs two functions, if non-null:  o It is an output param indicating whether whether this was the first time this unit was found in this request.
This category makes the current RCTUIManager instance available via the RCTBridge, which is useful for RCTBridgeModules or RCTViewManagers that need to access the RCTUIManager.
This class should be specialized by any integral type that converts / to/from a JSON scalar where there is a one-to-one mapping between / in-memory values and a string in JSON.
This file defines the IterativeTypeChecker class, which performs iterative type checking by tracking the set of outstanding type-checking requests and servicing them as needed.
This uses the real JNI function as a non-type template parameter to cause a (static member) function to exist with the same signature, but with try/catch exception translation.
ThreadLocalNoCheck is a pointer wrapper like ThreadLocal, except that it is explicitly initialized with getCheck(), rather than being initialized when it is first dereferenced.
When there are active mutable iterators, it is also overwhelmingly the case that there is only one, and on real applications exceeding 4 or 5 simultaneously is apparently rare.

/   - Generic code works with T*s a fair amount, but it usually /     doesn't have to deal with B*s after initialization /     because initialization returns a reliable pointer.
/ / A request is anchored on a declaration if the request is / specifically about that declaration, e.g., the superclass of a / class or some inheritance clause entry of a type.
/ / Being able to propagate values is important because there are a / number of cases (involving, say, property accessors) where values / are implicitly or previously generated.

1 second If set, the TransactionDB will use this implemenation of a mutex and condition variable for all transaction locking instead of the default mutex/condvar implementation.
All other fields are invalid if a state is not initialized, and notably, after all analysis has run, any blocks that still don't have initialized input states are not reachable.
Although 'relaxed' is formally UB by C++11 language rules, we should be OK because neither the processor model nor the optimizer can realistically reorder our uses of 'consume'.
BuiltinUnsafeValueBufferType - The builtin opaque fixed-size value / buffer type, into which storage for an arbitrary value can be / allocated using Builtin.allocateValueBuffer.
CAPI3REF: Tracing And Profiling Functions METHOD: sqlite3  These routines register callback functions that can be used for tracing and profiling the execution of SQL statements.
Cleanup function that will be called for a stored thread local pointer (if not NULL) when one of the following happens: (1) a thread terminates (2) a ThreadLocalPtr is destroyed
Currently the layout of this array kind is set up to match MixedArray, with some of the fields uninitialized to make the code path that transitions from struct to mixed cheaper.
Each loop contains a header block and a set of blocks that are dominated by the header and that can reach the header in the reverse CFG starting at any of the loop's back-edges.
Furthermore, all locations that contain values the instruction may decref should be included in `stores', even if (as an "optimization") we don't need to store anything over it.
However, if the compaction filter overrides IgnoreSnapshots to make it return false, the compaction filter will be called even if the keys were written before the last snapshot.
If "tableptr" is non-nullptr, also sets "*tableptr" to point to the Table object underlying the returned iterator, or nullptr if no Table object underlies the returned iterator.
In an effort to address this, newer versions of SQLite (version 3.3.8 and later) include support for additional result codes that provide more detailed information about errors.
It additionally performs dead code elimination when it initially adds instructions to the work queue in order to reduce compile time by not visiting trivially dead instructions.
Please note that INSTANTIATE_TEST_CASE_P will instantiate all tests in the given test case, whether their definitions come before or AFTER the INSTANTIATE_TEST_CASE_P statement.
Reads from compaction thread don't need to be cached because they are going to be soon made obsolete (due to nature of compaction) Usually you would pass Env::Default() as base.
The ability to disable the use of covering indices for full table scans is because some incorrectly coded legacy applications might malfunction when the optimization is enabled.
The fourth argument fname represents the function to be called The arguments following that are the arguments to fname See Options::Options in options.h for an example use case.
The function calls must obey to the ABI (Application Binary Interface) of the platform, which specify the purpose of all machine registers and stack handling among other things.
The idea is similar to target cache, except instead of caching the information, these collect information that can be used to generate a smarter TransKind::Optimize translation.
The interface resembles that of vector, but with less features since we aim to solve the problem that we have in hand, rather than implementing a full-fledged generic container.
The reason ranges extend downward is that it is common to need to refer to the class of all stack locations below some depth (this can be done by putting INT32_MAX in the size).
This is provided in this format because the region selector wants to terminate profiling translations at block ends (so it doesn't care where blocks start, just where they end).
`m_specialized' either holds a Class* or a 1 in its low bit, indicating that for a DataTypeSpecialized constraint, we require the specified class or an array kind, respectively.
despite the unfortunate name, this enables function renaming and interception in the interpreter as well as the jit, and also implies all functions may be used with fb_intercept
s* VALUE/XMLRPC_SERVER NAME XMLRPC_SERVER NOTES internal representation of an xmlrpc server  This struct is opaque to callers and should be accessed only via accessor functions.

@file CoreClasses.h  In CoreClasses.h wrappers for the core classes (jobject, jclass, and jstring) is defined to provide access to corresponding JNI functions + some conveniance.
Gather the set of constraints that involve the given type variable, / i.e., those constraints that will be affected when the type variable / gets merged or bound to a fixed type.

If VMRegAnchor is not used, HHVM's runtime will attempt to traverse the native stack, and will assert or crash if it attempts to parse a part of the stack with no frame pointers.
It returns the new value of vmfp(), as well as the catch trace to jump to---or nullptr if there is none, in which case the native unwinder should be invoked via _Unwind_Resume().

Note: although sljit_emit_fast_return could be replaced by an ijump, it is not suggested, since many architectures do clever branch prediction on call / return instruction pairs.
Once this function is called, unserialize() function or object destructor may be called at any time and the processing thread should not do any further operations on this object.
Since we use a serial file queue `RKFileQueue`, reading/writing from multiple threads should be perceived as being atomic, unless someone bypasses the `RCTAsyncLocalStorage` API.
The "depends" entries can be "cascading" / or "non-cascading", which describes whether or not downstream nodes should / be traversed after following a particular dependency edge.
The Mangler accumulates name fragments / with the mangleXXX methods, and the final string is constructed with the / `finalize` method, after which the Mangler should not be used.
The pointer may then be retrieved by the current or any future invocation of the same fts5 extension function made as part of of the same MATCH query using the xGetAuxdata() API.
This is necessary for PPC64 since instructions like "inc" must update the CR depending on the instruction result, and instructions like "addi" (with immediate) do not set the CR.
This is necessary since when one ThreadLocalPtr gets destroyed, we need to loop over each thread's version of pointer corresponding to that instance and call UnrefHandler for it.
To handle such loops, we rely on loop / canonicalization to transform the multiple backedge loops into multiple / loops with singular backedges or by merging the backedge blocks.
Using an integer to represent time: the value of time in seconds since 0 hours, 0 minutes, 0 seconds, January 1, 1970, Coordinated Universal Time, without including leap seconds.
We avoid expanding the lower level file set of a compaction if it would make the total compaction cover more than (expanded_compaction_factor * targetFileSizeLevel()) many bytes.
We don't distinguish between our representations for direct calls to free functions and those to member functions, with the assumption that they have the same calling convention.
When defining the static, just specify its type (T), the type that T's constructor will receive (TInit), and the name of the function that will be called for construction (init).
retranslate(Offset off, TransFlags trflags)  A request to retranslate the current function at bytecode offset `off', for when no existing translations support the incoming types.
/ / By default this just calls the module verify function as a sensible / default so that only functions which are able to provide the function / specific verification will do so.

But the only way to pass data out of a parser production is via a Token, and a Token can only have data in the form of an Expression, Statement, or TypeAnnotation, so here we are.
By contrast, if SQLITE_INDEX_SCAN_UNIQUE is not set and xUpdate returns SQLITE_CONSTRAINT, any database changes made by the xUpdate method are automatically rolled back by SQLite.
Correct usage of an InliningDecider produces a guarantee (or a refusal to guarantee) that a callee's region can be correctly transcluded and translated within the caller's region.
Currently string hash is 31-bit, thus it saves us some instructions to encode int keys as a negative hash, so that we don't have to care about the MSB when working with strhash_t.
Declaration that is a requirement of a protocol implemented by the / immediately enclosing nominal decl, in case the nominal decl does not / supply a witness for this requirement.
Default values for some parameters in ColumnFamilyOptions are not optimized for heavy workloads and big datasets, which means you might observe write stalls under some conditions.

For the case of compiled-on-4 and run-on-8, we include an extra pointer that is always NULL so that there are an even number of pointers which therefore are a multiple of 8 bytes.
Formal linkage is a property of types and declarations that / informs, but is not completely equivalent to, the linkage of / symbols corresponding to those types and declarations.
However, when loading from an Objective-C object, / this metadata may not have the heap-metadata header, and it may / not be the Swift type metadata for the object's dynamic type.
If successful, (*pz) is set to point to a buffer containing the text in utf-8 encoding, (*pn) is set to the size in bytes (not characters) of the buffer and SQLITE_OK is returned.
NOTE: It is unfortunate that it essentially duplicates the code from sil-combine, but doing so allows for avoiding any cross-layer invocations between SIL and SILOptimizer layers.
Note that this means IndirectFixups will not work for C++ code paths that need to do a fixup without making at least one other C++ call, but for the current use case this is fine.
This class was made for a very specific purpose (matching singleton patterns)---if we want something better, we should probably find some nice codegen library that does it for us.
This is almost the same as partitioning by AreaIndex, except we may interleave, e.g., Main and Cold blocks in the same partition if their actual code areas in `text' are the same.
We call dump() on the object instead of using dumpNode here so that the former will be available in a debug build as long as something in the program calls dump on the collection.
used for L and I symbolic flavors If intval is an unnamed local temporary, this offset is the start of the region we are using it (which we will need to have a fault funclet for).
- a function to release a userdata struct when it is no longer being managed by the cache  In the event of a cache miss the cache is allowed to grow up to a specified maximum size.

/ / Witness tables need to be instantiated at runtime in these cases: / - For a generic conforming type, associated type requirements might be /   dependent on the conforming type.
At start-up, this table will just have two fixed entries (for the two "unknown" type-indices), but initializating the type scanning machinery will replace it with the proper table.
Causes a trace (including the source file path, the current line number, and the given message) to be included in every test failure message generated by code in the current scope.
If aplying prefix bloom filter using it, all slices matching "abc:.*" will be extracted to "abc,", so any SST file or memtable containing any of those key will not be filtered out.
If the CompactionFilter was created by a factory, then it will only ever be used by a single thread that is doing the compaction run, and this call does not need to be thread-safe.
Logically, a global function or method starts off with a variable environment that contains only its locals, but a pseudo-main is handed its caller's existing variable environment.
Only certain types of locations are assigned ids, based on whether it maps to an AliasClass that that passes can currently plausibly optimize (because it is sufficiently concrete).
Otherwise, if the Clang type / is not itself a declaration context (for example, a typedef that / comes into Swift as a strong type), the Clang type declaration / will be provided.
Perform a strong_release instruction at the current location, attempting / to fold it locally into nearby retain instructions or emitting an explicit / strong release if necessary.
REQUIRED: The returned Snapshot is only valid up until the next time SetSnapshot()/SetSnapshotOnNextSavePoint() is called, ClearSnapshot() is called, or the Transaction is deleted.
Sets the next active logfile number when this memtable is about to be flushed to storage REQUIRES: external synchronization to prevent simultaneous operations on the same MemTable.
The benefit is, notify() can choose to notify the most recently waited conditional variable for an altered scheduling that potentially wakes up a thread with better thread caching.
The implementation of this method is expected to release all outstanding resources obtained by the mutex methods implementation, especially those obtained by the xMutexInit method.
The precondition that `t' is not the result of a DefConst is because this function makes no sense for that instruction, which is used to produce values that are defined everywhere.
This information is (FIXME will be) used by IRGen to lay out class vtables, and can be used by devirtualization passes to promote class_method instructions to static function_refs.
This initializer is intended to be used when the app has a single RCTRootView, otherwise create an `RCTBridge` and pass it in via `initWithBridge:moduleName:` to all the instances.
This mostly affects assembly that calls other functions with arguments (the arguments should be stored at FIXED_FRAME+0(R1), FIXED_FRAME+8(R1) etc) and some other low-level places.
This set of locations may be loaded by the instruction, but in order to `transfer' them to another memory location (which must be somewhere in its `stores' set), without an IncRef.

A relative reference to a function, intended to reference private metadata / functions for the current executable or dynamic library image from / position-independent constant data.
For portions of our analysis that rely on growing types reaching stable points for termination, this function must occasionally be used instead of union_of to guarantee termination.
Headers come from FastCGI webservers via the FCGI_PARAMS record in mangled form and need to be transfomred into their more familiar HTTP header form before passing them into the VM.
If a key is found, *found_record_for_key will be set to true and seq will be set to the stored sequence number for the latest operation on this key or kMaxSequenceNumber if unknown.
It is not necessary to cast xmlNode* to xmlDoc* before passing these pointers to libxml_register_node(), the type field will always be inspected before creating a new node resource.
Iterator ** Both ObjectVal class and ArrayVal class have iterator type that you can use to declare an iterator on a container object to go through the key-value pairs or value list.
NOTE: for the hash based lookup, if a key prefix doesn't match any key, the iterator will simply be set as "invalid", rather than returning the key that is just pass the target key.
Neither the name of the University nor the names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.
Note that this doesn't help with tapping on a touchable element that is being scrolled, unless you can call cancelTouches exactly between "touches began" and "touches ended" events.
Retrieve the fixed type corresponding to a given type variable, / recursively, until we hit something that isn't a type variable / or a type variable that doesn't have a fixed type.

The client must ensure that the merge operator supplied here has the same name and *exactly* the same semantics as the merge operator provided to previous open calls on the same DB.
The sqlite3_uri_boolean(F,P,B) routine returns true (1) if the value of query parameter P is one of "yes", "true", or "on" in any case or if the value begins with a non-zero number.
This is useful when implementing a new Env and ensuring that the semantics and behavior are correct (in that they match that of an existing, stable Env, like the default POSIX one).
This may have unforeseen ramifications: for example, a corruption of one DB entry may cause a large number of entries to become unreadable or for the entire DB to become unopenable.
This mechanism allows an orthogonal dimension of / distinguishing between TypeInfos, which is useful when multiple / TypeInfo subclasses are used to implement the same kind of type.
This value will be stored inside the SST file which will be used when reading from the file, which makes it possible for users to choose different encoding type when reopening a DB.
Variable-size immediates are implemented as follows: To determine which size the immediate is, examine the first byte where the immediate is expected, and examine its low-order bit.
When using an OptimisticTransactionDB: If this value is too low, some transactions may fail at commit time due to not being able to determine whether there were any write conflicts.
new_value should be constructed such that a call to DB::Merge(key, *new_value) would yield the same result as a call to DB::Merge(key, left_op) followed by DB::Merge(key, right_op).

@notes By default, if WriteResult() is called part-way through iteration, it will automatically advance the iterator to the end, and Keep() all items that haven't been traversed yet.
An example application might be a web browser that has its own databases for storing history and separate databases controlled by JavaScript applications downloaded off the Internet.
Applicable only when inplace_update_support is true, this callback function is called at the time of updating the memtable as part of a Put operation, lets say Put(key, delta_value).
Different from OnCompactionCompleted and OnFlushCompleted, this call-back is designed for external logging service and thus only provide string parameters instead of a pointer to DB.
FastCGI Records fall into two three categories:  Structured records contain a fixed contentData structure with values at specific offsets and numeric data encoded in big-endian form.
Given an LLVM IR intrinsic name with argument types remove (e.g. like / "bswap") return the LLVM IR IntrinsicID for the intrinsic or 0 if the / intrinsic name doesn't match anything.
However, if the database file is being synced as part of a multi-database commit, the argument points to a nul-terminated string containing the transactions master-journal file name.
Instances of this class may be concurrently accessed for any routines except move-construction and move assignment, or while it is being used in a call to ArrayTypeTable::repopulate.
Query the merge result These are valid until the next MergeUntil call If the merging was successful: - keys() contains a single element with the latest sequence number of the merges.
Returns: an (uncanonicalized, precise) AliasClass containing the stack slots corresponding to the ActRec that is being converted from a pre-live to a live ActRec by this instruction.
SuperMethodInst - Given the address of a value of class type and a method / constant, extracts the implementation of that method for the superclass of / the static type of the class.
The  sqlite3_uri_boolean(F,P,B) routines returns false (0) if the value of query parameter P is one of "no", "false", or "off" in any case or if the value begins with a numeric zero.
The index never contains incorrect return types, since the return types only shrink, which means we can just stop refining a return type whenever we want to without causing problems.
The value stores can either be an / archetype (for archetype path elements) or an unsigned value that / stores both the specific kind and the (optional) numeric value of that / kind.
This is used to link call sites to / externally defined specialization and should only be used when the function / body is not required for further optimization or inlining (-Onone).
This is useful for writing apartment-threaded code, where nothing is actually shared between different threads (hence no locking) but those variables are not on stack in local scope.
This is useful for writing apartment-threaded code, where nothing is actullay shared between different threads (hence no locking) but those variables are not on stack in local scope.
This macro has to make sure this statement is compiled but not executed, to ensure that EXPECT_DEATH_IF_SUPPORTED compiles with a certain parameter iff EXPECT_DEATH compiles with it.
To ignore debug-info instructions during an analysis, this file provides some utility functions, which can be used instead of the relevant member functions in ValueBase and SILValue:
We are not going to structure directories this way at all, but we will have PlainFile, ZipFile and Socket derive from this base class, so they can share some minimal functionalities.
We use a structure so that new fields can be added on the end in future versions, without changing the API of the function, thereby allowing old clients to work without modification.
destroyBuffer comes first because I expect it to be the most common operation (both by code size and occurrence), since it's the optimal way to destroy an individual local/temporary.
jit::MCGenerator is currently responsible for doing the work required to sync the VM registers, though this is an implementation detail and should not matter to users of VMRegAnchor.
/ / In general, this is spelled X.Type, unless X is an existential / type, in which case the ordinary metatype is spelled X.Protocol / and X.Type connotes the ExistentialMetatypeType.

A StackTraceProfiler incrementally constructs a prof-style caller tree from the native backtrace each time its count() method is called, then dumps the tree to stderr when destructed.
After MarkReadOnly() is called, this table rep will not be written to (ie No more calls to Allocate(), Insert(), or any writes done directly to entries accessed through the iterator.)
If the earliest sequence number is not known, kMaxSequenceNumber may be used, but this may prevent some transactions from succeeding until the first key is inserted into the memtable.
If there is an overlap between `loads' and `kills', then `kills' takes precedence for locations that are contained in both (i.e. those locations should be treated as actually killed).
In most cases that just means inheriting from ::testing::TestWithParam, but more complicated test hierarchies may need to inherit from Test and WithParamInterface at different levels.
On Version::Get(), it uses binary search to find a potential file and then check if a target key can be found in the file by comparing the key to each file's smallest and largest key.
Perform a take-initialization from the given fixed-size buffer / into an uninitialized fixed-size buffer, allocating the buffer if / necessary and deallocating the destination buffer.
Recover from clean shutdown We don't expect to find any corruption in the WAL Use case : This is ideal for unit tests and rare applications that can require high consistency guarantee

Send FCGI_GET_VALUES_RESULT Send FCGI_END_REQUEST NOTE: writeEndRequest takes a request_id as m_requestId may be different or uninitialized when using this method to decline a request
The FPI stack is used for inlining---when we start inlining at an FCall, we look in here to find a definition of the StkPtr,offset that can be used after the inlined callee "returns".
The container uses the same counterintuitive ordering as std::priority_queue: the comparison operator is expected to provide the less-than relation, but top() will return the maximum.
The method table is allocated at negative offset from the start of the Class object, and the method slot is used as the negative offset from the object to index into the method table.
The methods in this class will be called back from the RocksDB storage engine (C++) we then callback to the appropriate Java method this enables Comparators to be implemented in Java.
The purpose of using an external dictionary is more towards a collection of documents (which has common keys) rather than a single document, so that space saving will be siginificant.
The skipTombstonesNoBoundsCheck helper functions assume that either the specified location is not a tombstone OR that there is at least one non-tombstone after the specified position.
The xCheckReservedLock() method checks whether any database connection, either in this process or in some other process, is holding a RESERVED, PENDING, or EXCLUSIVE lock on the file.
The xRandomness(), xSleep(), xCurrentTime(), and xCurrentTimeInt64() interfaces are not strictly a part of the filesystem, but they are included in the VFS structure for completeness.
Unfortunately, gcc with -Wconversion-null warns when "passing NULL to non-pointer argument" (even a deduced integral argument), so the old implementation caused warnings in user code.

Depending on situations at call sites, the `-1' on `n' and `+1' on the return value can often get absorbed into neighboring instructions, this hopefully saves us an instruction or two.
EraseRefs    - array should contain unboxed properties CreateRefs   - array should contain boxed properties PreserveRefs - reffiness of properties should be preserved in returned array
Function: hdf_search_path - Find a file given a search path in HDF Description: hdf_search_path is a convenience/utility function that searches for relative filenames in a search path.
However, the portions of the HHIR program that may use that memory location in either of those ways may not overlap, based on the HHBC semantics of function calls and eval stack usage.
In particular, Width::Any is returned for intrinsics, architecture-specific instructions, zero-extending or truncating reg moves, branches, pushes/pops, and floating-point conversions.

This will assert that DieInDebugReturn12InOpt() crashes in debug mode, usually due to a DCHECK or LOG(DFATAL), but returns the appropriate fallback value (12 in this case) in opt mode.
Unless otherwise specified, the terms "declared instance properties" and "static properties" both refer to properties declared on this class as well as those declared on its ancestors.
We have a track record of self-deadlocking on these, and our pthread implementation tends to do crazy things when a rwlock is double-wlocked, so check and assert early in debug builds.
XXX: This IF_BYTEREG check is a special case for movzbl: we currently encode it using an opSz of sz::byte but it doesn't actually have a byte-sized operand like other instructions can.
only need 1 bit each for cow and z, but filling out the bitfield and assigning all field members at the same time causes causes gcc and clang to coalesce mutations into byte-sized ops.

If the implementation does not provide working versions of these routines, it should at least provide stubs that always return true so that one does not get spurious assertion failures.
If you are designing an interface or concept, you can define a suite of type-parameterized tests to verify properties that any valid implementation of the interface/concept should have.
In the case of profiling translations, these are sometimes freed eagerly when they become unreachable, as they will be erased from their associated SrcRec and are not tracked elsewhere.
Preconditions have no effects on correctness, but entering a block with a known type that violates a precondition is likely to result in a side exit after little to no forward progress.
REQUIRES: The client must ensure that the comparator supplied here has the same name and orders keys *exactly* the same as the comparator provided to previous open calls on the same DB.
The acquisition of the list mutex during find() is non-blocking (try_lock), so under heavy lookup load, the container will not stall, instead some LRU update operations will be omitted.
The current focus is initially determined by the breakpoint where the debugger is currently stopped and can thereafter be modified by list commands and by switching the the stack frame.
This module is used for two tasks:  o It is used by the region translator, and does most of the work of parsing HHBC into HHIR when we're trying to create an IRUnit out of a RegionDesc.
(See strong_iterators_exist().)  o Secondly we expect that we essentially never exceed a small number iterators (outside of code specifically designed to stress mutable array iteration).
/ / C functions can use the TwoWordPair::Return type to return a value in / two registers, compatible with Swift's calling convention for tuples / and structs of two word-sized elements.
/ Note that the parser requires that the input to a function type be a Tuple / or ParenType, but ParenType desugars to its element, so the input to a / function may be an arbitrary type.
A value is only +1 if / the associated consumption is TakeAlways, but conditional / operation should turn TakeOnSuccess consumptions into TakeAlways / consumptions on their success path.
All ephemeral service request stubs are sized to this fixed, architecture- dependent size, which is guaranteed to fit all service request types along with a terminal padding instruction.
Based on following output file format shown in plain_table_factory.h When opening the output file, IndexedTableReader creates a hash table from key prefixes to offset of the output file.
DIRTY means we need to sync them (by traversing the stack and looking up fixups)---this is what the value of tl_regState should be whenever we enter native code from translated PHP code.
For example, if Foo() calls Bar(), which in turn calls GetCurrentOsStackTraceExceptTop(..., 1), Foo() will be included in the trace but Bar() and GetCurrentOsStackTraceExceptTop() won't.
For example, type definitions inside functions are relatively rare, and also expensive to find (because there are so many functions), so the parser may not make the effort to find these.
Given a *_ref object which refers to a hybrid class, this will reach inside of it, find the mHybridData, extract the C++ instance pointer, cast it to the appropriate type, and return it.
If tests are operating on W registers, a subsequent write into an aliased W register should clear the top word anyway, so clobbering the full X registers should make tests more rigorous.
Instantiations or distinct subclasses of Vr wrap virtual register numbers in in a strongly typed wrapper that conveys physical-register constraints, similar to Reg64, Reg32, RegXMM, etc.
It is possible for cls() to be nullptr on a method---this occurs when a closure method is scoped to a null class context (e.g., if the closure is created in a non-method function scope).
Merging is the process by which functions, classes, and constants defined in a pseudomain are added to the unit in advance (or, optimistically, instead of) running the pseudomain's code.
Search the list for the (index)'th item (0-based) in (list:key) / A negative index indicates: "from end-of-list" / If index is within range: return true, and return the value in *result.
The AliasAnalysis cache can't directly map a pair of ValueBase pointers / to alias results because we'd like to be able to remove deleted pointers / without having to scan the whole map.
The return IP on the ActRec will be set to one of these stubs, so if someone tries to execute a return instruction, we get a chance to set up state for a POST_INTERP_RET service request.
They used to live at the top end of the options word, but that got almost full, so they were moved to a 16-bit flags word - which got almost full, so now they are in a 32-bit flags word.
This is not merely the sum of `top`/`left`s, as this function uses the *actual* positions of children, not the style specified positions - it computes this based on the resulting layout.
We store an explicit offset to the name table so that if a regex is compiled on one host, saved, and then run on another where the size of pointers is different, all might still be well.
When rebinding 'self' during an initializer delegation, we have to be / careful to preserve the object at 1 retain count during the delegation / because of assumptions in framework code.
(It still implicitly converts *from* most of them.)  We're leaving these functions deleted for now because we fear the possibility of changes to overload resolution by not declaring them.
/ / A declaration is more specialized than another declaration if its type / is a subtype of the other declaration's type (ignoring the 'self' / parameter of function declarations) and if
/ / This flag is automatically introduced when type matching destructures / a type constructor (tuple, function type, etc.), solving that / constraint while potentially generating others.
/ / This iterator stores a stack of the access path to the entry and / is therefore expensive to copy, and its operator* returns a proxy / object with a reference to its internal storage.
/ Three pointers is a sweet spot for Swift, because it means we can / store a structure containing a pointer, a size, and an owning / object, which is a common pattern in code due to ARC.
A type bound T : P, where T is a type that depends on a generic / parameter and P is some type that should bound T, either as a concrete / supertype or a protocol to which T must conform.
Any instructions with VdataPtr members that point inside the buffer returned by allocData() will automatically be fixed up during a relocation pass immediately before final code emission.
Asserts that a given statement causes the program to exit, either by explicitly exiting with a nonzero exit code or being killed by a signal, and emitting error output that matches regex.
CAPI3REF: Suspend Execution For A Short Time  The sqlite3_sleep() function causes the current thread to suspend execution for at least a number of milliseconds specified in its parameter.
Documents will remain valid until such time that there are no further references to nodes contained therein (including references to nodes whose underlying representation has been freed).
Eg: The Superversion stores a pointer to the current MemTable (that can be modified) and a separate list of the MemTables that can no longer be written to (aka the 'immutable memtables').
FIXME: This is due to having TypeSubstCloner inherit from SILClonerWithScopes, and having TypeSubstCloner be used both by passes that clone whole functions and ones that inline functions.
Generally, a statically-emitted relative reference can only be direct if it can be resolved to a constant offset by the linker, because loaders do not support forming relative references.
If the m_couldOOM flag is already unset, we return false, but if otherwise we would exceed the limit, we unset the flag and register an OOM fatal (though we do not modify the MM's stats).
Sets the Label to the bytecode offset of given by e, fixes up any instructions that have already been emitted that reference this Label, and fixes up the EmitterVisitor's jump target info

The parameters "created" and "desired" describe the pipes that need to be setup for the child process: "created" contains created fd for child, and "desired" contains desired fd in child.
Therefore, by checking the size of Helper(x), which can be done at compile time, we can tell which version of Helper() is used, and hence whether x can be implicitly converted to type To.
This allows for tests which use large, parameterized blocks of registers (such as the push and pop tests), but where certain registers must be avoided as they are used for other purposes.
This header file is also used by the loadext.c source file (part of the main SQLite library - not an extension) so that it can get access to the sqlite3_api_routines structure definition.
This method performs an early completion of a parallel write group, where the cleanup work of the leader is performed by a follower who happens to be the last parallel worker to complete.
This potentially emits a temporary allocation for the / result, so it must be called with the insertion point valid and dominating / any branches that will be involved in the computation.
Unfortunately, when I made the initial bug report, I oversimplified the use-case, and, while the case I reported was indeed fixed in Update 1 RC, none of our actual uses of it were fixed.
Using this method, a query such as '1s*' will match documents that contain the literal  token "1st", but not "first" (assuming the tokenizer is not able to provide synonyms for prefixes).
Usually this uses SelfObjectOfProtocol, / but when matching the instance type of a metatype with the instance type / of an existential metatype, since we want an actual conformance check.
We also pack bits into the key---the low bit is set if the function is a magic call (in which case the cached Func* is, and the second lowest bit is set if the cached Func has AttrStatic.
We avoid picking too many files in the source level so that we do not exceed the total source bytes for compaction to exceed (source_compaction_factor * targetFileSizeLevel()) many bytes.
bucket_count: number of fixed array buckets skiplist_height: the max height of the skiplist skiplist_branching_factor: probabilistic size ratio between adjacent link lists in the skiplist
(For example, if you are doing an include_once you need to know whether it was already included.)  o It means we should count this lookup as a request-local lookup for the current request.
/ / For references to generic function types or members of generic types, / this routine "opens up" the type by replacing each instance of a generic / parameter with a fresh type variable.
After the application has finished with the result from sqlite3_get_table(), it must pass the result table pointer to sqlite3_free_table() in order to release the memory that was malloced.
Allocate a new, empty, request-local array with the same mode as `other' and with enough space reserved for `capacity' members, or if `capacity' is zero, with the same capacity as `other'.
Any internal progress/error information generated by the db will be written to info_log if it is non-NULL, or to a file stored in the same directory as the DB contents if info_log is NULL.
Create a managed value that indicates that the value you're looking for / got stored into an initialization specified by an SGFContext, instead of / being represented by this ManagedValue.
Even though no further calls to the session will be made by the transport after onComplete the runtime will continue to access it to log the request and extract other post-completion data.
If someone else inserted the same key since our call to 'find', the temporary StructSpec instance above will be destructed, and the following will return the exisitng value from the cache:
If two or more collating functions are registered to the same collation name (using different eTextRep values) then all must give an equivalent answer when invoked with equivalent strings.
In case there was no multi-children node (linear tree), we just add a pair (pointer to leaf node, pointer to child node), with the child node being in a direct path from leaf to this node.
It is only safe to call key() and val() if all of the following conditions are met: 1) The calls to key() and/or val() are immediately preceded by a call to advance(), prepare(), or end().
It's used to verify that the stack is not modified between the beginning of a bytecode's translation and creation of any catch traces, unless exceptionStackBoundary() is explicitly called.

Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice immediately at the beginning of the file, without modification, this list of conditions, and the following disclaimer.
Step a single instruction in the block, and hand back flags  This entry point is used to propagate block entry states to mid-block positions after the global analysis has already finished.
The SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL and SQLITE_SYNC_FULL flags determine how energetic or rigorous or forceful the sync operations are and only make a difference on Mac OSX for the default SQLite code.
This is separate from an actual Class because in different requests (depending on include order), the actual instantiation of a PreClass may differ since names may have different meanings.
We define UniversalPrinter as a class template (as opposed to a function template), as we need to partially specialize it for reference types, which cannot be done with function templates.
canMutateBuffer() is vacuously true for buffers with zero capacity (i.e. the staticEmptyArray() case) because you can't meaningfully mutate zero-capacity buffer without first doing a grow.
raise_return_typehint_error() is the same as raise_recoverable_error(), except when compiled in RepoAuthoritative mode with HardReturnTypeHints the error handler is not allowed to recover.

GenericParamList - A list of generic parameters that is part of a generic / function or type, along with extra requirements placed on those generic / parameters and types derived from them.
However, for maximum code portability it is recommended that applications still make the distinction between protected and unprotected sqlite3_value objects even when not strictly required.
If F is not a NULL pointer and is not a database file pathname pointer that SQLite passed into the xOpen VFS method, then the behavior of this routine is undefined and probably undesirable.
In a pinch, EHFrameWriter could also just be used to write DWARF call frame instructions to a buffer, without the .eh_frame specifics, though there are currently assertions preventing that.
Instructions with these memory effects can be removed if we know the value being stored does not change the value of the location, or if we know the location can never be loaded from again.
It is intended that this variable be set once as part of process initialization and before any SQLite interface routines have been called and that this variable remain unchanged thereafter.
Perform a flow-insensitive analysis on the supplied blocks, collecting possibly distinct abstract memory locations that are explicitly referenced, and assigning them ids and may-alias sets.
The `stk' class is the entire stack range the instruction stores to, and the `ctx' class is a subclass of `stk' that is the stack slot where it'll store the context for the pre-live ActRec.
There are two sets of interface in FilterPolicy Set 1: CreateFilter, KeyMayMatch: used for blockbased filter Set 2: GetFilterBitsBuilder, GetFilterBitsReader, they are used for full filter.
This means that if the initial size is too low, reading and modifying elements at high indexes will be increasingly slower as the chain of AtomicVectors is walked to find the right element.
manual_url: This is not used in php5 xdebug, so it is not implemented force_display_errors: This is not relevant in hhvm as force_display_errors is always on, it is either stdout or stderr.
/ / Note that methods found via 'dot' syntax are expressed as DotSyntaxCallExpr / nodes, because 'a.f' is actually an application of 'a' (the implicit object / argument) to the function 'f'.
Any user that wants to emit code or data must call the view() function, which returns a struct of mutable references, appropriately selected based on hotness and whether profiling is active.
Associated types have a / set of requirements to which the type that replaces it much realize, / described via conformance to specific protocols, or inheritance from a / specific class type.
Finally epilogues are used to ensure that that the bodies of finally clauses are executed whenever a return, break, continue, or goto operation jumps out of their corresponding "try" blocks.
However, they're only profitable if there wasn't any other indirect reference to the target, and it is likely that their optimal use requires a more intelligent toolchain from top to bottom.
If memtable contains Merge operation as the most recent entry for a key, and the merge process does not stop (not reaching a value or delete), prepend the current merge operand to *operands.
If multithreaded compaction is being used *and* a single CompactionFilter instance was supplied via Options::compaction_filter, this method may be called from different threads concurrently.
If non-null, then we should collect metrics about database operations Statistics objects should not be shared between DB instances as it does not use any locks to prevent concurrent updates.
If the current function (func, a builtin) was called in a strict context then verify that tv is the correct type for argNum or attempt to convert it to the correct type, fataling on failure.
In the special case that a loop pre-header is being inserted, if the pre_header fields in LoopInfo are maintained, calling this function will keep the rest of the LoopAnalysis valid as well.
It's possible neither is true (e.g. if we're producing a TransKind::Live translation or we're producing a TransKind::Optimize translation and the link couldn't be attached for some reason.).

Specify to create a tailing iterator -- a special iterator that has a view of the complete database (i.e. it can also be used to read newly added data) and is optimized for sequential reads.
The fresh parameter indicates whether the scope is also a variable scope (i.e. a function, a closure, ...) or just a label scope (i.e. a loop body, a switch statement, a finally block, ...).
The latency in microseconds after which a std::this_thread::yield call (sched_yield on Linux) is considered to be a signal that other processes or threads would like to use the current core.
The purpose of the class is to allow File (and subclasses) to be managed by the request heap while also allowing their underlying OS handles to be persisted beyond the lifetime of a request.
This is a variant of UncheckedRefCast that works on address types, / thus encapsulates an implicit load and take of the reference followed by a / store and initialization of a new reference.
Tricky: this state is not used if newest_writer_ is empty when a writer enqueues itself, because there is no need to wait (or even to create the mutex and condvar used to wait) in that case.

C99 requires these for C++ to get the definitions of INT64_MAX and other macros used by Zend/zend_long.h C11 drops this requirement, so these effectively just backport that piece of behavior.
Common CPU status flags for all architectures (x86, ARM, PPC) - carry flag - overflow flag - zero flag - negative/positive flag (depends on arc) On mips, these flags are emulated by software.
GO_RESULTS_INITIALIZED indicates that the assembly function has initialized the stack space for its results and that those results should be considered live for the remainder of the function.
If the current stack pointer (as set by SetStackPointer) is sp, then it must be aligned to 16 bytes on entry and the total size of the specified registers must also be a multiple of 16 bytes.
Management of system and per-request (per-thread) mappings from names of ini settings to actual IniCallbackData is done privately with the statics s_user_callbacks and s_system_ini_callbacks.
Note: blocks in fault funclets will have factored edges to the blocks listed as handlers in any ExnNode that contained the fault-protected region, since those control flow paths are possible.
Same as MakeStatic but the string allocated will *not* be in the static string table, will not be in low-memory, and should be deleted using destructUncounted once the root goes out of scope.
The last four implementations are designed for situations in which iteration over the entire collection is rare since doing so requires all the keys to be copied into a sorted data structure.
The object is always valid, but the callee may / assume that the address does not alias any valid object and reorder loads / stores to the parameter as long as the whole object remains valid.
This allows us to print a char* as a raw pointer when it is compared against another char* or void*, and print it as a C string when it is compared against an std::string object, for example.
This does not take VM reentry into account, as that operation is part of the instruction that performed the reentry, and does not affect what vmpc() is set to after the instruction completes.

This is usually the Class which implements the method, but for closure methods (i.e., the __invoke() method on a closure object), it is instead the Class that the Closure object is scoped to.
When RequestBodyReadLimit is not set, the request is not enqueued for a worker until the entire body has been read, so only one thread will access m_bodyData and m_clientComplete at one time.
You may have to go spelunking in the Intel manuals:  http://www.intel.com/products/processor/manuals/  If you're looking for something more fully baked, here are some options to consider:  1.
loadFromMap() will call the failure callback if the specified name is not present in the specified map, or if there is an entry in the map but there was an error during the include operation.
(If this doesn't make sense, please don't try to use any of those APIs with this array.)  Sometimes, however, it's still necessary to deal with globals using a generic Array in extension code.
/ / For comparison, if a `CompilerVersion` contains more than one / version component, the second one is ignored for comparison, / as it represents a compiler variant with no defined ordering.
A NormalizedInstruction contains information about a decoded bytecode instruction, including the unit it lives in, decoded immediates, and a few flags of interest the various parts of the jit.
Alternatively, you can also pass any output stream object to a writer, as long as the stream object implements some basic functions of std::ostream (such as FbsonOutStream, see FbsonStream.h).
Do not mix calls to sqlite3_column_text() or sqlite3_column_blob() with calls to sqlite3_column_bytes16(), and do not mix calls to sqlite3_column_text16() with calls to sqlite3_column_bytes().
Flags that shouldn't be cleared by fetchAndClearSurpriseFlags, because fetchAndClearSurpriseFlags is only supposed to touch flags related to PHP-visible signals/exceptions and resource limits.
Idiomatic uses are going to involve updating id sets that already exist, so even with our move-construction support it will tend to involve allocations compared to mutation-based usage-styles.
In unbuffered mode we always bypass read-ahead buffer at ReadaheadRandomAccessFile When read-ahead is required we then make use of compaction_readahead_size value and always try to read ahead.
Options that notify the profiler on change collect_memory, collect_time: Added options specifying whether or not we should collect memory information and function start times for stack traces.
Otherwise (namely, in non-resumed contexts), the client must pass a non-none `spOff', and we do the sync in the stub to save work once the service request is completed and the jump is smashed.
Retrieve the source location of the place where the / conformance was introduced, e.g., an explicit conformance or / the point at which a subclass inherits a conformance from its / superclass.
The `v' argument should be a function object that accepts a call operator for all the bc::Foo types, with a nested member typedef called result_type that indicates the return type of the call.
The placement-new provided by the standard library is required by the C++ specification to perform a null check because it is marked with noexcept or throw() depending on the compiler version.
These APIs don't properly take class context into account when looking up the method, and they duplicate some of the functionality from invokeFunc(), invokeFuncFew(), and vm_decode_function().
This means that the user must invoke the test program via a path that contains at least one path separator (e.g. path/to/foo_test and /absolute/path/to/bar_test are fine, but foo_test is not).
Warning: this extra tracking is expensive, and only necessary when creating and destroying heap pointers in areas not already known as roots (thread locals, stack, rds, ExecutionContext, etc).

It can also be used for date computations such as easily comparing two dates, determining the day of the week, finding the date of yesterday or calculating the number of days between two dates.
Memory corruption, a segmentation fault, or other severe error might result if sqlite3_free() is called with a non-NULL pointer that was not obtained from sqlite3_malloc() or sqlite3_realloc().
Normally, if a scanner function for T receives a pointer to a block of memory larger than sizeof(T), it assumes an array of T had been allocated, and runs the scanner function for each element.

The decimal code is printed as signed integer when wchar_t is implemented by the compiler as a signed type and is printed as an unsigned integer when wchar_t is implemented as an unsigned type.
The return address is preserved in dst/dstw by sljit_emit_fast_enter (the type of the value stored by this function is sljit_p), and sljit_emit_fast_return can use this as a return value later.
There are a few cases in the JIT where we allocate a pre-live ActRec on the stack, and then call a helper that may re-enter the VM (e.g. for autoload) to do the rest of the work filling it out.
- HashSkipListRep: The memtable rep that is best used for keys that are structured like "prefix:suffix" where iteration within a prefix is common and iteration across different prefixes is rare.

Any internal progress/error information generated by the db will be written to info_log if it is non-nullptr, or to a file stored in the same directory as the DB contents if info_log is nullptr.
Determines whether this type has a bridgeable object / representation, i.e., whether it is always represented as a single / (non-nil) pointer that can be unknown-retained and / unknown-released.
Format of the vector is the same as IDebuggable::debuggerInfo, but we don't actually need to implement that interface since the execution context is not accessed by the debugger polymorphically.
Hence sqlite3_set_auxdata() should be called near the end of the function implementation and the function implementation should not make any use of P after sqlite3_set_auxdata() has been called.
NOTE: Setting disable_auto_compactions to 'false' through SetOptions() API does NOT schedule a flush/compaction afterwards, and only changes the parameter itself within the column family option.

The non-const setObjAttempted function is safe for concurrent use with multiple readers and writers on a live APCHandle---it is an exception to the thread-safety rule documented above the class.
This causes all allocation requests to be passed through to the underlying memory allocator so that heap profiling can capture backtraces for individual allocations rather than slab allocations.

During warmup, we profile the most common classes or interfaces involved in instanceof checks in order to set up a bitmask for each class to allow these checks to be performed quickly by the JIT.
If an xToken() callback returns any value other than SQLITE_OK, then the tokenization should be abandoned and the xTokenize() method should immediately return a copy of the xToken() return value.
If either integer is negative, then the setting is not changed but instead the prior value of that setting is written into the array entry, allowing the current retry settings to be interrogated.
If set, the client wants a best-effort solution to the constraint system, / but can tolerate a solution where all of the constraints are solved, but / not all type variables have been determined.
Note that the returned sizes measure file system space usage, so if the user data compresses by a factor of ten, the returned sizes will be one-tenth the size of the corresponding user data size.
The actual container nodes are allocated with a conservative scan action, so if the container lies on the stack or anywhere else we're conservative scanning, we'll conservative scan that as well.
The underlying iterator can be freed manually through the  call to ReleaseIter or automatically (as needed on space pressure or age.) The iterator is recreated using the saved original arguments.
(2) after hash index checking, we identify two locations (because of hash bucket conflicts), we binary search the two location to see which one is what we need and start to read from the location.
A designated initializer is an initializer responsible for initializing / the stored properties of the current class and chaining to a superclass's / designated initializer (for non-root classes).
And then we make the second last level to be base level, to start to merge L0 data to second last level, with its target size to be 1/max_bytes_for_level_multiplier of the last level's extra size.
Given the address of a value of AnyObject protocol type and a method / constant referring to some Objective-C method, performs dynamic method / lookup to extract the implementation of that method.
Ideally, casting a non-resource value to a resource would throw or produce null, but there are a few places in the runtime and the extensions that would need to be updated first to make that work.
If a list of types is provided in the template instantiation, only conservative scan if the scanner generator believes any of the given types potentially have pointers to request allocated memory.

If the resulting existential / type involves several different protocols, there will be mappings for each / of those protocols, in the order in which the existential type expands / its properties.
If the xSleep() method of the default VFS is not implemented correctly, or not implemented at all, then the behavior of sqlite3_sleep() may deviate from the description in the previous paragraphs.
Same as runTest:, but allows for passing initialProps for providing mock data or requesting different behaviors, configurationBlock provides arbitrary logic for the hosting root view manipulation.
Snapshot tests call RCTTestModule.verifySnapshot whenever they want to verify what has been rendered (typically via requestAnimationFrame to make sure the latest state has been rendered in native.
The stack of structure markers indicating the locations of / structural elements actively being parsed, including the start / of declarations, statements, and opening operators of various / kinds.
Units are cached across requests in either case, so even in non-RepoAuthoritative mode this function won't need to compile it over and over, but it does need to check whether the file has changed.
When a function is treadmilled its bytecode may no longer be available, keep a table of associated SrcRecs to be reclaimed as it will be impossible to walk the bytecode stream to search the SrcDB.
Because it is fixed-size, / it can be allocated in places that must be agnostic to the / actual type: for example, within objects of existential type, / or for local variables in generic functions.
Description: hdf_get_node is similar to hdf_get_obj, except instead of stopping if it can't find a node in the tree, it will create all of the nodes necessary to hand you back the node you ask for.
Determines whether the type is trivially representable within / the foreign language, meaning that it is both representable in / that language and that the runtime representations are / equivalent.
If PCRE is to support UTF-8 on EBCDIC platforms, we cannot use normal character constants like '*' because the compiler would emit their EBCDIC code, which is different from their ASCII/UTF-8 code.
If we did reach the end of the common length, then we have three cases: looking up 'abc' in 'abc' looking up 'abc' in 'abcdef' looking up 'abc' in 'ab' We might have exhausted the node's local key.
Implementation notes:  None of the classes in this header file can be instantiated directly (i.e. you cannot create a FbsonKeyValue or FbsonValue object - all constructors are declared non-public).
Once the server calls onHeadersComplete() it guarantees that it will remain live until the transport calls onComplete() and that it will only access the transport via onBody() and onBodyComplete().
Synopsis: Combine(gen1, gen2, ..., genN) - returns a generator producing sequences with elements coming from the Cartesian product of elements from the sequences generated by gen1, gen2, ..., genN.
The flags in this opcode table supply default values for the querying functions in IRInstruction---those functions involve additional logic (based on operand types, etc) on a per-instruction basis.
The individual allocations are quantized into a fixed set of size classes, the sizes of which are an implementation detail documented here to shed light on the algorithms that compute size classes.
This is a specialization of swift::TypeVisitor which: /   - works only on canonical and fully-checked types and /   - preserves the canonicality of the visited types in the /     static (C++) type.
This layout allows for an important optimization when an APCTypedValue is contained inside an APCArray---in such cases the APCTypedValue is returned directly instead of creating another TypedValue.
With SQLITE_ACCESS_READWRITE, the xAccess method checks whether the named directory is both readable and writable (in other words, if files can be added, removed, and renamed within the directory).
/ / This predicate doesn't guarantee that the type is bridged, but rather is / a quick way to check whether the type is a value type that could / conceivably be bridged to an Objective-C class type.
/ / Various places in the AST, such as the set of extensions associated with / a nominal type, keep track of the generation number they saw and will / automatically update when they are out of date.
As a consequence, the count field is not the "real" refcount of a RefData - instead the real refcount can be computed by calling getRealCount() (which simply adds the count and cow fields together).
By comparing the array pointed to through m_ref with the array pointed to by m_container, MArrayIter can detect if user code has modified the inner cell to be a different array or a non-array value.
Commands throw this when they do something that causes the server to start running code again, so we pop out of the command prompt loop and go back to waiting for interrupt messages from the server.
Given a type T and an associated type X of a protocol PT to which / T conforms, where X is required to implement some protocol PX, return / the witness table witnessing the conformance of T.X to PX.
Given two binary strings haystack and needle, bstrrstr performs a case sensitive search and returns a pointer to the last occurrence of needle in haystack, or NULL if needle is not part of haystack.
Google Test does not support death tests for VC 7.1 and earlier as abort() in a VC 7.1 application compiled as GUI in debug config pops up a dialog window that cannot be suppressed programmatically.
If a request is not actively translating, it will perform a "hinted drop" of the lease: the lease is unlocked but all calls to acquire(false) from other threads will fail for a short period of time.
Neither the name of the Lite Speed Technologies Inc nor the names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.
The following bunch of macros and functions are used to build up tables of helper function pointers and determine which helper should be called based on a variable number of bool and enum arguments.
The transaction is aborted when there are errors, or during shutdown when the server has stopped enqueuing requests, or when the post request takes too long before we see EOM during server shutdown.
This may cause other blocks in the unit to become unreachable, and also note that it is not legal to run simplify() on instructions in blocks that were made unreachable by other calls to simplify().
When SQLite calls the xTruncate() method, the cache must discard all existing cache entries with page numbers (keys) greater than or equal to the value of the iLimit parameter passed to xTruncate().
libstdc++ has sufficient C++11 support as of GCC 4.6.0, __GLIBCXX__ 20110325, but maintenance releases in the 4.4 and 4.5 series followed this date, so check for those versions by their date stamps.

state machine for FCGI_GET_VALUES Event count is the number of pending writes that have not called the writeSuccess() or writeError() callbacks yet, plus one if we have not yet received a readEOF().
(Since iteration order is unspecified, this semantic would seem weird anyway.)  This holds a pointer to a NameValueTable whose lifetime must be guaranteed to outlast the lifetime of the GlobalsArray.
/ / We use a TinyPtrVector since in most cases this will only return one / SILBasicBlock since non-failure noreturn functions should not occur often / implying in most cases this will be one element.
Abstract class describing generic type parameters and associated types, / whose common purpose is to anchor the abstract type parameter and specify / requirements for any corresponding type argument.
In addition to isPossiblyUsedExternally() it returns also true if this / is a (private or internal) vtable method which can be referenced by / vtables of derived classes outside the compilation unit.
In some environments it is desirable to limit the depth of recursive calls of match() more strictly, in order to restrict the maximum amount of stack (or heap, if NO_RECURSE is defined) that is used.
It expects AttrUnique/AttrPersistent have already been set up correctly (but won't be wrong if they aren't set up at all), and expects traits are already flattened (it might be wrong if they aren't).
On Symbian, BOOST_HAS_TR1_TUPLE causes Boost's TR1 tuple library to use STLport's tuple implementation, which unfortunately doesn't work as the copy of STLport distributed with Symbian is incomplete.
Rather, a fully / type-checked and well-formed subscript expression refers to a subscript / declaration, which provides a getter and (optionally) a setter that will / be used to perform reads/writes.
Simplest runTest function simply mounts the specified JS module with no initialProps and waits for it to call  RCTTestModule.markTestCompleted()  JS errors/exceptions and timeouts will fail the test.
The RemoteAST library defines interfaces for exploring the relationships between a remote process and a local AST which provides a (static and incomplete) picture of the code running in that process.
This file defines the Initializer class, which is a kind of DeclContext used for expressions that are not part of a normal code-evaluation context, such as a global initializer or a default argument.
This is efficient because it columns these two common use cases: (1) hash index only identify one location, we read the key to verify the location, and read key and value if it is the right location.
This result indicates that the lookup produced candidate lists, / potentially of viable results, potentially of error candidates, and / potentially empty lists, indicating that there were no matches.
This table has the following semantics:  o If there are any 'active' MArrayIters (i.e. ones that are actually associated with arrays), one of them will be present in the first Ent slot in this table.
Type annotations to change generated function behavior:  The below macros provide ways to describe certain information about types to the function generator which changes how the function is scanned.
When jitting code before a unique class is defined, we can often still burn the Class* into the TC, since it will be defined by the time the code that needs the Class* runs (via autoload or whatnot).
o In situations with inlined calls, we may in fact have AFrame locations that refer to the same concrete memory locations (in the evaluation stack) as other AStack locations in the same HHIR program.
