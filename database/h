'Constructor' Factory Function
'Consume' does not require a barrier on ARM64, but LLVM doesn't know that.
'Either' indicates that both branches could be taken.
'Fallthrough' indicates that the conditional branch was known to be not taken, and control goes to the fallthrough block.
'LOW' is the default pool.
'Main' code, or code that executes most frequently, should have either the 'Likely' or 'Neither' Block::Hint.
'Taken' indicates that the conditional branch was known to be taken (e.g. because the condition was a constant).
'box' is always nil.
'bucketSize' specifies how many buckets to track for the histogram.
'ci' is released after this function is returned, and must be copied if it is needed outside of this function.
'dest' may partially overlap the head of 'src', because the / values are taken as if in front-to-back order.
'dest' may partially overlap the tail of 'src', because the / values are taken as if in back-to-front order.
'exportPercentile' specifies at what percentile values we should report the stat.
'exportTypes' specifies what kind of statistics to export for each level.
'index' is the index of the test in the type list 'Types' specified in INSTANTIATE_TYPED_TEST_CASE_P(Prefix, TestCase, Types).
'inout' arguments are printed specially.
'internal' is the default, don't add it.
'key' and 'data' passed to zend_accel_hash_update() must be already allocated in shared memory.
'let', 'var', and 'inout' cannot be argument labels.
'levels' specifies at which granularity should the stats be tracked.
'max' is the maximal value in the histogram.
'min' is the minimal value in the histogram.
'name' must be path relative to the db directory.
'numBuckets' specifies how many buckets to keep at each level.
'num_entries' is initialized by zero and grows when new data is added.
'parts' points to an array of Slices.
'result' may alias with op1 or op2, so we need to ensure that 'result' is not updated until after we have read the values of op1 and op2.
'self' has been consumed.
'self' is a keyword, we cannot allow to insert it into the source buffer.
'self' is a normal variable.
'self' needs to be consumed next time it is referenced.
'this' may be a branch or a PC-relative addressing instruction.

() The table for aligned-pointer-to-pointer types.
(*ACCEPT) encountered
(*PRUNE) or (*SKIP) encountered
(*values) will always be resized to be the same size as (keys).
(-1 - unknown)
(1) 'Bitset' mode, when MSB (63th bit) is set.
(1) Allocated nodes are never deleted until the InlineSkipList is destroyed.
(1) Allocated nodes are never deleted until the SkipList is destroyed.
(1) Don't add more methods to Func here.
(2) 'Big-integer' mode, when MSB is not set.
(2) A key shared the same prefix as the previous key, which is encoded as format of (1).
(2) For people who are interested in implementing a high-performance HTTP server, derive a new class from Server just like LibEventServer does.
(2) For simplicity, there is no equivalent to the Slice type.
(2) It uses MemTableRep::KeyComparator to compare items for iteration and equality.
(2) No other writes happen during AddFile call, otherwise DB may get corrupted.
(2) SstFileReader (for SST Dump) opens the table and dump the table contents using the interator of the table.
(2) The contents of a Node except for the next/prev pointers are immutable after the Node has been linked into the InlineSkipList.
(2) The contents of a Node except for the next/prev pointers are immutable after the Node has been linked into the SkipList.
(2) after hash index checking, we identify two locations (because of hash bucket conflicts), we binary search the two location to see which one is what we need and start to read from the location.
(2) key is in between smallest and largest.
(3) A key shared the same prefix as the previous key, which is encoded as the format of (2).
(3) DBImpl::AddFile() calls this function to read the contents of the sst file it's attempting to add
(3) Errors are represented by a null-terminated c string.
(3) It can be accessed concurrently by multiple readers and can support during reads.
(3) No snapshots are held.
(3) When recovering from transaction logs, it creates a table builder to write to a level-0 output file (In DBImpl::WriteLevel0TableForRecovery, by calling BuildTable()) (4) When running Repairer, it creates a table builder to convert logs to SST files (In Repairer::ConvertLogToTable() by calling BuildTable())
(3) key is larger than largest, implying it is also larger than smallest.
(4) Items are never deleted.
(A member variable pointer or member function pointer doesn't really point to a location in the address space.
(A non-static Mutex is defined/declared in the usual way).
(And this means we may actually rely on whether copy elision (NRVO etc) is happening in some places for correctness.)  Use carefully.
(Assuming write_thread_slow_yield_usec is set properly) increasing this value is likely to increase RocksDB throughput at the expense of increased CPU usage.
(Basically if the next integer key in an array is already at the maximum integer.)
(But no non-persistent strings will ever have KindOfPersistentString.) so-called "uncounted" strings are persistent (not ref counted) but not static.
(CalculateBaseBytes() is called) This may or may not return number of level files.
(Debug info only).
(Defined outside of any other function body.)
(Destructors are not called when they come from IRUnit.)
(Does not assume that it is.)  No throw as long as V has a nothrow move assignment operator.
(Due to round-off error, etc, it's very unlikely that two floating-points will be equal exactly.
(E.g. combine common idioms or patterns, smash code, etc.)
(E.g. if there are type aliases.)
(E.g. the translator write lease.)  Key must be an atomically loadable/storable type.
(E.g. via calls to may_alias in AliasAnalysis.)
(Exact, case-sensitive comparison.)
(For example, if you are doing an include_once you need to know whether it was already included.)  o It means we should count this lookup as a request-local lookup for the current request.
(For instance, we have some support for "alternation", except that if we ever succeed in matching a branch, we'll never revisit it).
(I think this also applies to BSD, but we can cross that road when we come to it.)
(I.e. if the global is a KindOfRef, this will set the value in its RefData.)
(I.e. is its internal handle valid.)
(I.e. it cannot point into a RefData.)
(I.e. numeric strings are compared numerically.)
(I.e. the string may have junk after the number.)
(I.e., this function won't return things like KindOfUncounted.)  Returns KindOfString for both SStr and Str.
(If not present, returns nullptr.)
(If this doesn't make sense, please don't try to use any of those APIs with this array.)  Sometimes, however, it's still necessary to deal with globals using a generic Array in extension code.
(If we actually *know* it is in an object, locTy will be a subtype of TObj.)
(In SILGen we don't try to explode structs, because doing so / would require considering resilience, a job we want to delegate to IRGen).
(In the non-persistent region, the space for T will be zero'd at the start of each request.)  Links are atomic types.
(In this case, the snapshot-semantics of the rocksdb Iterator is not atomic anymore).
(Instead of just pumping through our m_list and m_map.)
(Integers are converted to strings.)  - size() is an O(N) operation.
(Intended for debugging purposes.)
(It can do this because it knows the addresses of all the instances from the debug information).
(It can't be freed.)
(It may be Gen if there was nothing interesting known.)
(It may however *be* a trait.)  - It implements no interfaces.
(It may however *be* an interface.)  - It is not an enum.
(It must be pushed before the formal / evaluation because, in some cases, the formal evaluation of a base / l-value will immediately begin a formal access that must end at / the same time as that of its projected subobject l-value.)
(It still implicitly converts *from* most of them.)  We're leaving these functions deleted for now because we fear the possibility of changes to overload resolution by not declaring them.
(It used to be implemented using ordered comparisons on the opcode enum, so it might be a mistake.
(It's not unusual to want to printf registers, etc.
(It's unclear if anything is relying on this, but try not to in new code.)
(Known dependency in unwind-x64.h.)
(Like the lvalBlackhole, etc.)  It's hard for this to matter to client code for now because we don't expose an intersection or difference operation.
(Likely naming relic from hphpc days.)
(NativeData and ResumableFrame).
(Negative, Zero, Carry, Overflow)
(No need for an acquire/release handshake with ourselves.)
(Not callable directly by php code.)
(Notably the universe size may be changed.)  Nothrow guarantee.
(Note that the first plus is parsed as a unary operator.)
(Note that this does not include types like TInitUnc---it's only the TOpt* types.)
(Note you can set it to something like /dev/stderr or /dev/stdout if you want the logs printed to your terminal).
(Note: the supplied block list need not be RPO-sorted.)
(Numeric strings are not treated specially.)
(Obsolete) ARC-specific: this class has a .release_ivars method.
(Offset,Length) pairs.
(Rationale: if you move construct from something it's nice that it is still legal to compare to other things it was legally comparable to before that.)  This returns whether the two sets have the same elements, regardless of the order they were inserted.
(SEMI_)END_BUF anchor distance
(See hhbbc.)  This function accomplishes this.
(See kStackCheckReenterPadding and kStackCheckLeafPadding.)
(See new_iter_array.)
(See simplify.h.)
(See strong_iterators_exist().)  o Secondly we expect that we essentially never exceed a small number iterators (outside of code specifically designed to stress mutable array iteration).
(Since iteration order is unspecified, this semantic would seem weird anyway.)  This holds a pointer to a NameValueTable whose lifetime must be guaranteed to outlast the lifetime of the GlobalsArray.
(TUninits turn into TInitNull, and potentially reffy types return the "inner" type, which is always a subtype of InitCell.)
(Takes extra time.)
(Template arguments must be determined at compile-time.)
(The "non-inline" and "has-extra-inhabitants" bits still require additional fixup.)
(The base class destructor is only invoked for instances that point to the collection in the client.)
(The caller will pack key and value into a single buffer and pass that in as the parameter to Insert).
(The decider has a `disabled' flag for this purpose.)  - The client passes this region to shouldInline() to determine whether it is inlinable.
(The default to enable it should be 'false'.)
(The index type is a template parameter in order to allow different uses of this map to have different sized indexes).
(The returned pointer is never pointing into a RefData.)
(The stack is determined by leaf node pointers) Nodes with only one child just don't need a list, there it is enough to just have a pointer to the child node.
(The wrapper is refcounted, as required by ArrayData, but the table pointed to is not.)
(Then we rely on DCE to remove the cases that can't happen.)
(There will not be a real execution context or anything like that.)
(There's a 32-bit integer in the AtomicCountable base class here.)
(These names are intended to be / compatible with Xcode's SDKs.) / / If the triple does not correspond to a known platform, the empty string is / returned.
(This could be empty.)
(This feature is gated on being compiled with jemalloc.)
(This is because of kNamedLocalDataType support in the underlying NameValueTable.)  - Append/prepend operations are not supported.
(This is because the array is created as a temporary.)  Foreach by reference is a pain.
(This is either TInt or a subtype of it.)
(This is making use of the x64 property that "canonical form" addresses have all their upper bits the same as bit 47, and that this is zero for linux userland pointers.)
(This is to allow more efficient implementation of this case in some derived classes.)
(This is used for killing stack slots below the call depth.)  The `stack' set contains stack locations the call will read as arguments, as well as stack locations it may read or write via other means (e.g. debug_backtrace, or pointers to stack slots to a CallBuiltin).
(This just unmasks the lowest-order bit, which designates `src' as a Cctx rather than a This.)
(This makes it usable in classes that are arena-allocated.)  Zero-initializing this class is guaranteed to produce an empty set.
(This may seem odd, but it's not really any different from knowing that a physical portion of the heap may be treated as both an AElemI or AProp, but not at the same time based on HHBC-level semantics.)
(This requirement does not appear to be documented, but failing to zero-terminate causes a segfault in classify_object_over_fdes() in unwind-dw2-fde.c.
(This should generally be straightforward, as pin and / unpin may be conservatively assumed to have arbitrary / side-effects.)
(Though the results may be silly) CoerceInPlace will attempt to convert the type and return false on failure CoerceOrThrow will attempt to convert the type and both raise a warning and throw a TVCoercionException on failure
(Thus, if this function is used in contexts where the bounds are not statically known, TInitNull must be unioned in for correctness.)
(Unfortunately we can't use allocator_traits yet.)
(Unless you want the first element to remain accessible inline instead of moved to the heap.)
(Update of leaf node pointer and list of multi-children nodes needed when leaf gets a child in direct path from leaf to root node.) But only in that case, which should be a fairly rare case (which is then possible, but not totally cheap).
(Version 2.1, February 1999) Please read the following detail of the licence (in japanese).
(We don't want this to accidentally get used for things like pointers or aggregates.)  Floating point support could be added later if we need it ...
(We may want to distinguish these two cases at some point if we start trying to track real information about Refs, but not yet.)
(We over-check in these situations, but it's fine.)
(We pre-create static strings for all 256 characters at process startup.)
(We would like to make this unnecessary eventually.)
(What sort of function call is being made.)
(When a db is first created, the earliest sequence number will be 0).
(Windows has one root directory per disk drive.)
(You probably shouldn't be using Exception directly either.)

*            FTS5 then queries the index for each synonym individually.
*            In this case, when tokenizing query text, the tokenizer may  *            provide multiple synonyms for a single term within the document.
*            Using this method, when tokenizing document text, the tokenizer *            provides multiple synonyms for each token.
*          Regardless of whether or not shared-cache mode is enabled by *          default, use a private cache.
*    May you find forgiveness for yourself and forgive others.
*    May you share freely, never taking more than you give.
*   A tokenizer instance is required to actually tokenize text.
*   If the returned value is SQLITE_DONE, xQueryPhrase returns SQLITE_OK.
*   On the other hand, it may require more CPU cycles to run MATCH queries, *   as separate queries of the FTS index are required for each synonym.
*   Or, if some error occurs before the query completes or is aborted by *   the callback, an SQLite error code is returned.
*   Otherwise, the error code is propagated upwards.
*   Phrase matches are numbered starting from zero, so the iIdx argument *   should be greater than or equal to zero and smaller than the value *   output by xInstCount().
*   The second and third arguments are an array of nul-terminated strings *   containing the tokenizer arguments, if any, specified following the *   tokenizer name as part of the CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE statement used *   to create the FTS5 table.
*   There is no limit to the number of synonyms that may be provided for a *   single token.
*  * If F is a NULL pointer, then sqlite3_uri_parameter(F,P) returns NULL and * sqlite3_uri_boolean(F,P,B) returns B.
* (Third-party VFS implementations might also make the distinction * between SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL and SQLITE_SYNC_FULL, but among the * operating systems natively supported by SQLite, only Mac OSX * cares about the difference.)
* *   Each extension function is allocated a single auxiliary data slot for *   each FTS query (MATCH expression).
* *   FTS5 assumes the xToken() callback is invoked for each token in the  *   order that they occur within the input text.
* *   For full prefix support, method (3) may be preferred.
* *   If an error (e.g. an OOM condition) occurs within this function, an *   the auxiliary data is set to NULL and an error code returned.
* *   If an xToken() callback returns any value other than SQLITE_OK, then *   the tokenization should be abandoned and the xTokenize() method should *   immediately return a copy of the xToken() return value.
* *   If parameter iCol is greater than or equal to the number of columns *   in the table, SQLITE_RANGE is returned.
* *   If the bClear argument is non-zero, then the auxiliary data is cleared *   (set to NULL) before this function returns.
* *   If the callback function returns any value other than SQLITE_OK, the *   query is abandoned and the xQueryPhrase function returns immediately.
* *   If the query runs to completion without incident, SQLITE_OK is returned.
* *   If there is already an auxiliary data pointer when this function is *   invoked, then it is replaced by the new pointer.
* *   In many cases, method (1) above is the best approach.
* *   Method (2) offers a midpoint between (1) and (3).
* *   Returns SQLITE_OK if successful, or an error code (i.e. SQLITE_NOMEM)  *   if an error occurs.
* *   The final argument is an output variable.
* *   The first argument passed to this function is a copy of the (void*) *   pointer provided by the application when the fts5_tokenizer object *   was registered with FTS5 (the third argument to xCreateTokenizer()).
* *   The second argument indicates the reason that FTS5 is requesting *   tokenization of the supplied text.
* *   The second argument passed to the xToken() callback ("tflags") should *   normally be set to 0.
* *   The xDelete callback, if one is specified, is also invoked on the *   auxiliary data pointer after the FTS5 query has finished.
* *   When using methods (2) or (3), it is important that the tokenizer only *   provide synonyms when tokenizing document text (method (2)) or query *   text (method (3)), not both.
* * * xGetAuxdata(pFts5, bClear) * *   Returns the current auxiliary data pointer for the fts5 extension  *   function.
* * * xRowCount(pFts5, pnRow) * *   This function is used to retrieve the total number of rows in the table.
* * * xSetAuxdata(pFts5, pAux, xDelete) * *   Save the pointer passed as the second argument as the extension functions  *   "auxiliary data".
* * A call to sqlite3_initialize() is an "effective" call if it is * the first time sqlite3_initialize() is invoked during the lifetime of * the process, or if it is the first time sqlite3_initialize() is invoked * following a call to sqlite3_shutdown().
* * A result table is an array of pointers to zero-terminated UTF-8 strings.
* * A result table might consist of one or more memory allocations.
* * A single database handle may have at most a single write-ahead log callback  * registered at one time.
* * Additionally, if xBestIndex sets the SQLITE_INDEX_SCAN_UNIQUE flag, then * SQLite also assumes that if a call to the xUpdate() method is made as * part of the same statement to delete or update a virtual table row and the * implementation returns SQLITE_CONSTRAINT, then there is no need to rollback * any database changes.
* * After the application has finished with the result from sqlite3_get_table(), * it must pass the result table pointer to sqlite3_free_table() in order to * release the memory that was malloced.
* * An sqlite3_value object may be either "protected" or "unprotected".
* * Applications are strongly discouraged from using this global variable.
* * At present, there is only one option that may be configured using * this function.
* * Calling this function with an argument that is not a NULL pointer or an * open blob handle results in undefined behaviour.
* * Changing the value of this variable while a database connection is * open can result in a corrupt database.
* * Enabling mutexes incurs a measurable performance penalty.
* * IMPORTANT: The estimatedRows field was added to the sqlite3_index_info * structure for SQLite version 3.8.2.
* * If an interface fails with SQLITE_MISUSE, that means the interface * was invoked incorrectly by the application.
* * If another thread changes the autocommit status of the database * connection while this routine is running, then the return value * is undefined.
* * If either the current value or the highwater mark is too large to * be represented by a 32-bit integer, then the values returned by * sqlite3_status() are undefined.
* * If the SQL statement does not currently point to a valid row, or if the * column index is out of range, the result is undefined.
* * If the argument to sqlite3_mutex_held() is a NULL pointer then * the routine should return 1.
* * If the operating system does not support sleep requests with * millisecond time resolution, then the time will be rounded up to * the nearest second.
* * If the requested page is already in the page cache, then the page cache * implementation must return a pointer to the page buffer with its content * intact.

* If a non-negative fourth parameter is provided to sqlite3_bind_text() * or sqlite3_bind_text16() or sqlite3_bind_text64() then * that parameter must be the byte offset * where the NUL terminator would occur assuming the string were NUL * terminated.

* That integer is 0 to disable zero-damage mode or 1 to enable zero-damage * mode.
* The SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL and SQLITE_SYNC_FULL flags determine how * energetic or rigorous or forceful the sync operations are and * only make a difference on Mac OSX for the default SQLite code.
* The SQLite core will never attempt to acquire or release a * lock outside of this range
* The ability to disable the use of covering indices for full table scans * is because some incorrectly coded legacy applications might malfunction * when the optimization is enabled.
* The amount of extra space required can change depending on the compiler, * target platform, and SQLite version.
* The application does not need to worry about freeing the result.

* The remaining entries all point to query results.
* The second choice is a Mac OS X style fullsync.
* The second parameter is a pointer to an integer into which * is written 0 or 1 to indicate whether triggers are disabled or enabled * following this call.
* The second should be of type (void*).
* The sqlite_int64 and sqlite_uint64 types are supported for backwards * compatibility only.
* The synopsis of the meanings of the various limits is shown below.
* The sz argument should be the size of the largest database page * (a power of two between 512 and 65536) plus some extra bytes for each * page header.
* The type for a callback function.
* The xCheckReservedLock() method checks whether any database connection, * either in this process or in some other process, is holding a RESERVED, * PENDING, or EXCLUSIVE lock on the file.
* The xRandomness() function attempts to return nBytes bytes * of good-quality randomness into zOut.
* The xSleep() method causes the calling thread to sleep for at * least the number of microseconds given.
* Then as long as the pattern string remains the same, * the compiled regular expression can be reused on multiple * invocations of the same function.

* These no-op macros are used in front of interfaces to mark those * interfaces as either deprecated or experimental.
* These routines are designed to aid in process initialization and * shutdown on embedded systems.

* When that happens, the second error will be reported since these * interfaces always report the most recent result.
* With SQLITE_ACCESS_EXISTS, the xAccess method * simply checks whether the file exists.
* With SQLITE_ACCESS_READ, the xAccess method * checks whether the file is readable.

** Dictionary size ** By default, the dictionary size is 255 (1-byte).
** Endianness ** Note: FBSON serialization doesn't assume endianness of the server.
** External dictionary ** During parsing a JSON string, you can pass a call-back function to map a key string to an id, and store the dictionary id in FBSON to save space.
** External dictionary ** During query processing, you can also pass a call-back function, so the search will first try to check if the key string exists in the dictionary.
** Input Buffer ** FbsonInBuffer is a customer input buffer to wrap raw character buffer.
** Iterator ** Both ObjectVal class and ArrayVal class have iterator type that you can use to declare an iterator on a container object to go through the key-value pairs or value list.
** Load ** FbsonDocument is usable after loading packed bytes (memory location) into the object.
** Output Stream ** FbsonOutStream is a custom output stream classes, to contain the FBSON serialized binary.
** Parsing JSON ** FbsonJsonParserT parses JSON string, and directly serializes into FBSON packed bytes.
** Query ** Query is through dereferencing into ObjectVal.
** Query ** Querying into containers is through the member functions find (for key/value pairs) and get (for array elements), and is in streaming style.
** WARNING ***
** WARNING *** There is also similar byte-flipping code in pcretest.c, which is used for testing the byte-flipping features.
** WARNING *** When new fields are added to these structures, remember to adjust the code in pcre_byte_order.c that is concerned with swapping the byte order of the fields when a compiled regex is reloaded on a host with different endianness.

- A node's local key contains no common prefix with the local keys of its left or right siblings.
- A relative reference is a (signed) offset from the address of the reference to the address of its direct referent.
- A static property of this class is accessed.
- Accounting for usage of memory "by this request", whether it goes through the request-local allocator, or the underlying malloc implementation.
- Addresses are loaded using an rip-relative lea to aid code relocation.
- An absolute reference is a pointer to the object.
- Be arena-allocatable (no non-trivial destructors).
- Can be shared between multiple dbs.
- Condition codes produce a setcc based on the status flags passed to the emit routine.
- Convenience initializer - A bridge will be created internally.

- Corruption: Merge operator reported unsuccessful merge.
- Designated initializer -
- Does not support Merge operations.
- Does not support Snapshot.
- Each smart pointer is actually two pointers (8 bytes instead of 4).
- Eat trailing size specifications from numbers i.e. ignore 10L - More fixes for very short files  Revision 1.16  1995/03/25  22:06:45  christos - use strtoul() where it exists.
- Either CopyConstructible, or implement a clone member function that takes an arena to clone to.
- Emit `thenBlock' to `vcold' (with all other blocks in `vmain').
- Every time a pointer is assigned, the entire list of pointers to that object is traversed.
- FunctionPointerBox is a box for function pointers.
- GTEST_COMPILE_ASSERT_ works by defining an array type that has -1 elements (and thus is invalid) when the expression is false.
- HashSkipListRep: The memtable rep that is best used for keys that are structured like "prefix:suffix" where iteration within a prefix is common and iteration across different prefixes is rare.
- If the check succeeds, the client produces a region for the callee at the appropriate entrypoint for the call.
- If the function is marked with AttrParamCoerceModeFalse, then the function can also return bool in addition to this type.
- If the returnType() is KindOfString, KindOfArray, or KindOfObject, null may also be returned.
- Implement a hash() method.
- IndirectFixup: this is used for some shared stubs in the TC.
- Insertion and removal can only happen at the end of the sequence (although you can modify elements anywhere in the sequence).
- It has no parent OR The parent is hoistable and defined earlier in the unit OR The parent is already defined when the unit is required  The very last condition here (parent already defined when the unit is required) is not known at parse time.
- It is efficient to find entries that share a common prefix with a given key.
- It uses no traits.
- Iteration order is not specified.
- Keep track the total size of all SST files.
- Likewise, if the function is marked AttrParamCoerceModeNull, null might also be returned.
- Many vectors are no larger than a particular constant size, and such vectors should be stored as compactly as possible.
- MergeInProgress: Put/Delete not encountered and unable to merge operands.
- Most vectors have no bits set, and those that do tend to have them set in coherent ranges.
- Negative numbers are used for other blocks, which correspond to blocks created by inlining and which don't correspond to the beginning of a profiling translation.
- Non-string keys are not really supported.
- NotSupported: Merge operator is missing.
- Set a maximum allowed space limit for SST files that when reached the DB wont do any further flushes or compactions and will set the background error.
- Since the final executable has already been produced, the shared object is embedded into the executable in a custom section.
- Sometime at start-up, the init() function is called.
- Strong iterators "past the end" are not updated when new elements are added.
- Taken edges (these are encoded in the last instruction in hhbcs).
- The contentData of GET_VALUES contains name-value pairs with only names, while the contentData of GET_VALUES_RESULT contains name-value pairs containing the values of the requested parameters.
- The elements must be trivially copyable/assignable and have trivial destructors.
- The garbage collector instantiates Scanner, calls Scanner::scan() for roots, and Scanner::scanByIndex() for values on the request heap (using the stored type-index).
- The pointer types used with this class must be known to be at least 2-byte aligned with the default arguments, since it discriminates using the low bit (NB: this is not the case for string literals on gcc).
- The return type is deliberately chosen to be not void, so it will be a conflict if void Setup() is declared in the user's test fixture.
- The scanner generator is run during the build, after the final link where the executable is produced.
- The simpler definition
- The type annotation macros spit out various static fields and member functions with special names.
- There is no non-const iterator support, and we have forward iterators only.
- There is no other definition for a class of the same name in its Unit.
- These records should be associated with the null reqeuestId.
- This class assumes pointers of L and R types never alias.
- This list of caveats may be incorrect and/or incomplete.
- This method is private, so it will be another compiler error if the method is called from the user's test fixture.
- Tracking "sweepable" objects--i.e. objects that must run custom cleanup code if they are still live at the end of the request.
- VectorRep: This is backed by an unordered std::vector.
- When level is 2, it's from constructors that turn these into fatals - When level is 1, it's from system funcs that turn both into warnings - When level is 0, it's from user funcs that turn missing arg in warnings
- a function to release a userdata struct when it is no longer being managed by the cache  In the event of a cache miss the cache is allowed to grow up to a specified maximum size.

/        Matching argument values must be passed to exitTrue and exitFalse /        of the resulting Condition object.
/        This is an additional guarantee on top of the ImportTypeKind /        cases that allow bridging, and applies to the entire type.
/     All bits are considered to be zero in this case.
/     Generally this will find something from the entry block.
/     It is legal to call getAddressForInPlaceInitialization() /     multiple times.
/     Once getTupleElements has been called, the returned initializations /     must be completely initialized (including calling /     finishInitialization) before finishInitialization is called on the /     outer initialization.
/     Therefore, given a collision, it should be okay to scan a list and /     ask whether each is acceptable.
/    E.g. if a struct contains 2 references, a mayWrite effect means that /    memory is written to one of the referenced objects (or to both).
/    In this case the effects refer to all references in the value type.
/   "InContext": Represented with the lvalue flag set but with no SILValue, /                this represents a value that was emitted directly into an /                initialization stored by an SGFContext.
/   - A path component's implementation can be resilient and yet /     still qualify for physical access if we are in a privileged /     component.
/   - All exported functions must be compiled to at least provide /     a minimally-expanded entrypoint, or else it will be /     impossible for components that do not have that type /     to call the function.
/   - Assignments involving two B*s are only likely in /     existential code, where we won't have the right /     typing guarantees to use them (-2 operations).
/   - Generic code works with T*s a fair amount, but it usually /     doesn't have to deal with B*s after initialization /     because initialization returns a reliable pointer.
/   - Similarly, any sort of abstracted function call must go through /     a minimally-expanded entrypoint.
/   / If the current function section is Postmatter, StartOfPostmatter / is non-null and the current insertion block is ordered after / that (inclusive).
/   2) When a stored property satisfies a protocol requirement, these /      accessors end up as entries in the witness table.
/   3) When a stored property is accessed outside of the storage /      declaration's resilience domain, when the owning type or /      global variable is resilient.
/   If it's a value type that can't fit in three words, the data will be in /   its own heap box, so *StartOfInstanceData will be the address of that box.
/   If ownership is not obtained, returns immediately.

/   This API implicitly embeds an assumption that these arguments /   never form part of the uniquing key for the conformance, which /   is ultimately a statement about the user model of overlapping /   conformances.

/ / Basic design considerations: / /   - We want to be able to efficiently look up a key and find something.
/ / Because a valid source location always corresponds to a source buffer, / this routine always returns a valid buffer ID.
/ / Because an ArgumentSource might contain an unevaluated expression, / care must be taken when dealing with multiple ArgumentSources to / preserve the original evaluation order of the program.
/ / Because basic blocks are generally constructed with an insertion / point active, users should be aware that this behavior leads to / an emergent LIFO ordering: if code generation requires multiple / blocks, the second block created will be positioned before the / first block.
/ / Being able to propagate values is important because there are a / number of cases (involving, say, property accessors) where values / are implicitly or previously generated.
/ / Beyond these constraints, we would like for our data structure to have the / following properties for performance reasons: / / 1.
/ / Blocks are always ObjC reference counting compatible.

/ / The intent behind this is so that analyses that cache / SILFunction* to be able to be invalidated and later / recomputed so that they are not holding dangling pointers.
/ / The intent is that this should basically act exactly like / ArrayRef except projecting away the Operand-ness.
/ / The intention is it to be paired with a base SILValue in order to provide a / lightweight manner of working at a high level with object and address / projections.
/ / The intention of this invalidation kind is to allow analysis that / rely on a specific call graph structure to recompute themselves.
/ / The intention of this invalidation kind is to tell analyses like the / Dominance Analysis and the PostOrder Analysis that the underlying CFG / has been modified.

/ / The labels argument is null if and only if there are no element / labels in the tuple.
/ / The load is marked invariant.
/ / The low bit of the target offset is used to mark an indirect reference, / and so the low bit of the target address must be zero.
/ / The main difference in between this routine and update for same loop inst / is that if we see any decrements on a value, we treat it as being / guaranteed used.
/ / The main purpose of this class is to enable one to reason about iterated / chains of projections.
/ / The member types are presented in the / same order as GenericParamList::getAllArchetypes would present for an / equivalent GenericParamList.
/ / The metatype representation is a SIL-only property.
/ / The metatype value can comes from evaluating an expression and then / getting its metatype.
/ / The metatype value can either be the static self type (in a designated / initializer) or a dynamic self type (in a convenience initializer).
/ / The module must contain source files.
/ / The module will be constructed in the Raw stage.
/ / The module's name will be scheduled for serialization if necessary.
/ / The most common use case for this is one-time initialization / (like caching method ids).
/ / The most common use case for this is storing the result / in a "static auto" variable, or a static global.

/ / The only difference between the ranking kind and the kind is / that implied conformances originating from a synthesized / conformance are considered to be synthesized (which has a / lower ranking).
/ / The only time that the pointer is null is during initialization.
/ / The operations on this type must not assert or crash for any of the / following reasons: /   - the parameters do not satisfy preconditions /   - the memory reader fails for any reason /   - the remote address is invalid /   - the remote address space is corrupt /   - the remote address space contains valid-seeming constructs that /     somehow violate local well-formedness rules /   - the local AST does not contain information for the remote construct / / The operations on this type *may* misbehave if the invariants of / the local AST have been violated.
/ / The order of Substitutions must match the order of generic parameters.
/ / The policy about the sourcekitd API is to keep it source and ABI compatible, / thus SOURCEKITD_VERSION_MAJOR is expected to remain stable.
/ / The postmatter section is a part of the function intended for / things like error-handling that don't need to be mixed into the / normal code sequence.
/ / The reason that we track this information is that all nodes below such an / ancestor must necessarily be alive.
/ / The reason this is needed is because basic blocks cannot have / subregions, yet many graph algorithms want to be able to iterate over / the subregions of a region regardless of whether it is a basic block, / loop, or function.
/ / The reason why all of this work is being done for subregions is because we / are working around the following contradiction: / / 1.
/ / The referent type always satisfies allowsOwnership().
/ / The replacement identifier will be the same size as the placeholder so that / the new buffer will have the same size as the input buffer.
/ / The representation is a map from strings to kind mask / node pairs, plus / a mask of kinds that have been marked dirty.
/ / The representation of an existential metatype cannot be thin.
/ / The representation of values in Swift can vary according to how / their type is abstracted: which is to say, according to the pattern / of opaque type variables within their type.
/ / The result is a Builtin.Int1.
/ / The result of simplification is a constraint system that consisting of / only simple constraints relating type variables to each other or / directly to fixed types.
/ / The resulting set of constraints may contain duplicates.
/ / The resulting source location will be valid if the argument name / was specified separately from the parameter name.
/ / The resulting types can be compared canonically, so long as additional / type equivalence requirements aren't introduced between comparisons.
/ / The return value makes it easy to SROA arguments since we can return the / amount of SROAed arguments we created.
/ / The return value may be an empty identifier, in which case the enum would / not be imported.
/ / The returned string already has its lifetime extended to match other / arguments.
/ / The search stop when we encounter an instruction that may decrement / the return'ed value, as we do not want to create a lifetime gap once the / retain is moved.
/ / The semantic type is what a type pretends to be during / type-checking: that is, the type that getTypeOfRValue would / return on a variable of this type.
/ / The semantics of most of these operations are specified as if an / exploded value were a normal object that is merely not located in / memory.
/ / The size/alignment/stride template arguments are for when we want / to override the language defaults for a type.
/ / The standard protocol is that the caller is responsible for / calling swift_unpin on the return value.
/ / The subexpression is represented as a TupleExpr or ParenExpr and / passed on to the appropriate semantics-providing conversion / operation.
/ / The subscript operator can be used to retrieve the nodes that / correspond to these type variables.
/ / The substitutions must carry origTy to substTy.
/ / The table itself is lazily constructed and updated when / lookupDirect() is called.
/ / The tag value can be used to index into the array returned by the / NominalTypeDescriptor's GetCaseTypes function to get the payload type / and check if the payload is indirect.
/ / The two SILValue pointers are mapped to size_t indices because we need an / efficient way to invalidate them (the mechanism is described below).
/ / The type of a function argument may carry an l-value.
/ / The type of a return value, local variable, or field may not / carry an l-value.
/ / The type of the sub-expression should always be either: /   - a non-existential type of the appropriate kind or /   - an existential type of the appropriate kind which is a subtype /     of the result type.
/ / The type parameters must be known to not be concrete within the context.
/ / The type variables themselves are tail-allocated.
/ / The type-of-rvalue should always be the substituted formal type / lowered under this abstraction pattern.
/ / The ultimate goal is to emit something like a / DW_TAG_APPLE_ast_ref_type (an external reference) instead of a / local reference to the type.
/ / The values use the same representation as / FullTableEntry::DeclsOrMacros.
/ / Then we perform a postorder DFS of the loop nest.
/ / Then when we initialize BBRegions, we just assign the resulting Region's / pointer into the array using its RPO index rather than performing a / push_back.
/ / There are currently three supported platform conditions: / - os: The active os target (OSX or iOS) / - arch: The active arch target (x86_64, i386, arm, arm64) / - _runtime: Runtime support (_ObjC or _Native)
/ / There are separate sequences for explicit and implicit closures.
/ / There are several potential representations for metatypes within / SIL, which are distinguished by the metatype representation.
/ / There are two kinds of function types:  monomorphic (FunctionType) and / polymorphic (PolymorphicFunctionType).
/ / There is no built-in subscripting in the language.
/ / There is no need for an initializeBufferWithTakeOfBuffer, because that / can simply be a pointer-aligned memcpy of sizeof(ValueBuffer) / bytes.
/ / There is one major exception to what sub-expressions in a type / expression can be abstracted with type variables: a type substitution / must always be materializable.
/ / There is one major risk with (3): naively implemented, a single / function value which undergoes many coercions could build up a / linear number of re-abstraction thunks.
/ / Therefore there are five basic data operations: /   initWithCopy(T*, T*) /   initWithTake(T*, T*) /   assignWithCopy(T*, T*) /   assignWithTake(T*, T*) /   destroy(T*) / / As a further optimization, for every T*, there is a related / operation which replaces that T* with a B*, combinatorially.
/ / These appear as both properties and methods in ObjC and should be / imported as methods into Swift.

/ / These are the hyperedges of the graph, connecting this node to / various other nodes.
/ / These argument strings must be kept alive as long as the Job is alive.
/ / These bits are populated in increasing value according to the order of / the getElementsWithPayload() array, starting from zero for the first / element with payload.
/ / These locations should not be included in the debug line table.
/ / These need to be passed to the Swift frontend
/ / These refinement contexts form a lexical tree parallel to the AST but much / more sparse: we only introduce refinement contexts when there is something / to refine.

/ / These strings must be kept alive as long as the Job is alive.
/ / Thick metatypes are used for class and existential metatypes, / which permit dynamic behavior.
/ / This API is used by RemoteAST.

As a consequence of this, any caller of expand() must produce correct (but potentially suboptimal) results if expand is hardcoded to always return an empty bitset.
As a consequence, the count field is not the "real" refcount of a RefData - instead the real refcount can be computed by calling getRealCount() (which simply adds the count and cow fields together).
As a contributor, you agree to allow your code to be used under both.
As a convenience, build a metadata object with internal linkage / consisting solely of the standard heap metadata.
As a hack, assume defer bodies are noescape.
As a note for future consideration, we could consider precomputing a 64-bit mask, so that the fraction of the last qword can be checked faster.
As a policy matter, we currently define / contexts broadly: a lambda expression in a function is a new / DeclContext, but a new brace statement is not.
As a result it's important to understand the life-cycle of a transaction and the concurrency contract that it has with both the VM and the session.

As an example the jstring wrapper inherits from the jobject wrapper, so does the jclass wrapper.
As an invariant, this tree is always either empty or has no right subtree.
As base/basictypes.h doesn't compile on Windows, we cannot use uint32, uint64, and etc here.
As data point is added and time rolls forward, new bucket is created and the earliest bucket expires.
As for src and srcw they must be 0 if op is SLJIT_UNUSED, otherwise see below the description about source and destination arguments.
As implemented, this just chooses the highest-numbered PhysReg, since it's only ever used to choose an SF register.
As in the usual sense of tail call, this is really a jmp which will cause the callee's return to serve as the caller's return.
As many as this block has predecessors.
As soon as / the scope object is destroyed, corresponding data from the hashtable is / deleted.
As stated above, for efficiency we do not store everything known about an object inside its ObjectType.
As such, it / is correct and necessary to add new values above this one.
As the space required for a translation will be unknown until it is complete this strategy allows allocation of an appropriately sized block.
As things have been extended, some of these are no longer fixed lenths, but are minima instead.
As we update SSA / form we change branches and invalidate (by deleting the old branch and / creating a new one) the Operand pointed to by the ValueUseIterator.
As with * all file-control actions, there is no guarantee that this will actually * do anything.
As with conjureBeginInlining, this function should not be used in a region that will be executed.

At present, only XboxServer uses this event, so we adopt its particular interface.
At request-end, any un-freed memory is explicitly freed (and in debug, garbage filled).
At runtime we still might resolve this name to another type alias, becoming a type alias for KindOfArray or something in that request.
At some point if compile time / is not an issue, this value should be made more aggressive (i.e. greater).
At some point, we should add the concept of "max len" to these so we can't get DoS'd by someone sending us a line without an end point, etc.
At start-up, this table will just have two fixed entries (for the two "unknown" type-indices), but initializating the type scanning machinery will replace it with the proper table.
At the current implementation, snapshot is taken at the time Seek() is called.
At the end of each Bridge transaction, we call collectUpdatedFrames:widthConstraint:heightConstraint at the root node to recursively lay out the entire hierarchy.

At the same time max_bytes_for_level_multiplier and max_bytes_for_level_multiplier_additional are still satisfied.
At the same time, indexes will be built.
At this point this only zeroes out the sequence number if possible for better compression.
At this point we are sure that the object we found is of the same type we are looking for, so we downcast it to that type without further checks.
At this point, T is incomplete, and so we cannot access T::kJavaDescriptor directly.
At this point, if the flag is set for this thread, the PHP and async stack will be logged for that thread.
At this point, we are fully set-up.
At various points in the lifetime of the arena, you can introduce a new `frame' by calling beginFrame.
At various points, the runtime will check whether this word contains a higher number than what it believes the evaluation stack needs to be (remember the eval stack grows down), which combines a stack overflow check and a check for unusual conditions.

Because / it has these generic parameters, it is always a DeclContext.
Because all constants defined in hhvm programs create a process-lifetime string for the constant name, this module also manages a mapping from constant names to rds::Handles.
Because both client and server streams use the same mechanisms for encryption we use the LSB to denote clients.
Because it is both computed very fast and distributes very well.
Because it is fixed-size, / it can be allocated in places that must be agnostic to the / actual type: for example, within objects of existential type, / or for local variables in generic functions.
Because of a bug in code emission, functions sometimes have inconsistent return flavors.
Because of a circular dependence with ExecutionContext, these translation-related helpers cannot live in translator.h.
Because of rint()
Because of the storage requirements of StructInst, object / creation goes through 'create()'.
Because of the storage requirements of TupleInst, object / creation goes through 'create()'.
Because of this, the various "setter" functions for thisProps here actually just union the new type into what we already had.
Because of type punning with the *NR classes (ArrNR, StrNR, etc), we want to assert that offsetof(T, m_px) is a specific value in all these classes.
Because open() has two modes, we have to macros to replace it
Because pointers and strings are 1-1, can just compare the ptr.
Because pointers and strings are 1-1, can just hash the ptr.
Because the buffer is always / NUL-terminated, this points to the NUL terminator.
Because the capture list is evaluated outside of the closure, this / CaptureList wraps the ClosureExpr.
Because these adjacencies are as / important as the edges themselves and are expensive to calculate from the / constraints, each node in the graph tracks both its edges (constraints) and / its adjacencies (the type variables) separately.
Because these extensions share libxml data we use Resource wrappers to control destruction of libxml data.
Because this is a destructor, we might already be in the process of unwinding when this function is called, so we need to ensure that no exceptions can escape so that the unwinder does not terminate the process.
Because this is variadic, object creation goes / through 'create()'.
Because we cannot guarantee that the token / will ever occur, this skips to some likely good stopping point.
Because we often convert between JIT block IDs and TransIDs, these are signed integers (blocks can have negative IDs).
Because zvals can be shared by multiple things "by value", it was necessary to add fields to RefData to support this.
Before a successful code generation, this function returns with 0.
Before allocating, check if the allocation would cause the request to OOM.
Before returning the pointer, this increments the population count---the caller must make some change to this element to cause its first uint64_t bytes to be non-zero.
Before such instructions are emitted, cmov support should be checked by sljit_x86_is_cmov_available function.
Before that, the version is 1.

Besides checking if fatal failures were reported, it only delegates the reporting to the former result reporter.
Besides that caveat this should be treated exactly the same as / shared.
Best to free this memory with gdFree(), not free()
Better yet, don't use this function -- write real truecolor PNGs and JPEGs.
Beware if you change the order or the numerical values, as there are a few places in the code that depends on the order or the numeric values.
Beware if you change the order or the numerical values, as we assume smaller numbers indicating better health condition here.
Beware if you change the order, as we may have a few type checks in the code that depend on the order.

Builtins don't have filenames
BumpPtrAllocator for types dependent on contextual generic parameters, / which is reset when the generic context is popped.
But * the reason the mutex does not exist is because the build is not * using mutexes.
But * these numbers are not part of the result table itself.
But / the variadic arguments have to come last.
But I am going to leave this in for now.
But ParameterizedTestCaseInfo is going to call it for each Test/Parameter value combination.
But current and future file sizes used by determining where to place a file are based on best-effort estimation, which means there is a chance that the actual size under the directory is slightly more than target size under some workloads.
But doing so might / break any outstanding CleanupsDepths we've vended, of which we / only really care about those held by the Scope RAII objects.
But don't call it directly, use one of the helpers below.
But for maximum safety, mutexes should be enabled.
But for now this interface remains part of the internal implementation and is subject to change.
But generally the goal here should be to eliminate a class of bugs by having the same (textual) code implement both serialization and deserialization.
But internal implementations of runtime functions do not need to be exported.
But it  / quacks like a duck.
But it is kept / for other purposes: / *) It is inlined and the debug info keeps a reference to the function.
But it is not enforced.
But it is pretty reliable.
But note that it's O(size()) worst case.
But note we're also relying on the destructors not throwing.
But nothing here is going to run the constructor.
But some of the runtime entries are invoked directly from the foundation.
But that * compiler magic ended up generating such a flurry of bug reports * that we have taken it all out and gone back to using simple * noop macros.
But that would require an additional register for the mask.
But the analysis could be extended / appropriately via simple dataflow or through the use of post-dominator / trees.
But the application does * not want the user to be able to make arbitrary changes to the * database.
But the main library does not want to redefine * the API.
But the number 33 and a few other equally good numbers like 17, 31, 63, 127 and 129 have nevertheless a great advantage to the remaining numbers in the large set of possible multipliers: their multiply operation can be replaced by a faster operation based on just one shift plus either a single addition or subtraction operation.
But the only way to pass data out of a parser production is via a Token, and a Token can only have data in the form of an Expression, Statement, or TypeAnnotation, so here we are.
But the optimal way to pass an Int to a function might / well be different from the optimal way to pass a String.
But the zero register is also encoded as register 31.
But this class allows keep-alive connections to be pooled for repetitively HTTP requests.
But this is quince
But this is the same.
But this might change in * future releases of SQLite.
But unlike Transaction::Put(), no conflict checking will be done for this key.
But we can do better.
But we can still do better.
But we currently always give classes field-offset vectors, whether they need them or not.
But we have to put the TagBit in in case we constructed a null from the right (we'll have a tagged null).
But we still need to be / conservatively correct.
But we want to be correct even in a / non-canonicalized case implying that we need to be able to support / multiple backedge blocks.
But we will have to switch to 64 bit here to support very long strings.
But when it is set, we hit it a lot.
But you will have to use either a static buffer or allocate a dynamic buffer before beeing able to call the function.
But you will have to use either a static buffer or allocate a dynamic buffer before being able to call the function.

By "compatible" we mean that the values can be compared by the respective operator.
By /   design, language options only affect whether a token is valid /   and/or the exact token kind produced (e.g. keyword or /   identifier), but not things like how many characters are /   consumed.
By Phil Knirsch based on netpbm fixes by Alan Cox.
By allowing for invalid iterators for basic blocks, / we can allow for this.
By allowing it to allocate memory, it can possibly put correlated stuff in consecutive memory area to make processor prefetching more efficient.
By calling GetWriteBatch(), a user will get the WriteBatch for the data they inserted, which can be used for DB::Write().
By calling this function, the transaction will essentially call SetSnapshot() for you right before performing the next write/GetForUpdate.
By comparing the array pointed to through m_ref with the array pointed to by m_container, MArrayIter can detect if user code has modified the inner cell to be a different array or a non-array value.
By contrast, if SQLITE_INDEX_SCAN_UNIQUE is not * set and xUpdate returns SQLITE_CONSTRAINT, any database changes made by * the xUpdate method are automatically rolled back by SQLite.
By default allow all opcodes.
By default handlers are "noop", that can be overridden by child classes.
By default level based compaction will only compact the bottommost level if there is a compaction filter
By default target_file_size_multiplier is 1, which means by default files in different levels will have similar size.
By default the exposed method will match the first part of the Objective-C method selector name (up to the first colon).
By default this is nil, but you can override it with (for example) a UIActivityIndicatorView or a placeholder image.
By default this returns lower ids first (note that this is returning things that are larger according to its Compare function, like std::priority_queue).
By default this takes on 100,000, which is significantly smaller than the 2 million frames provided by the internal trace profiler, which is good, since it is very easy to turn on a feature requiring tracing/profiling support, and a huge memory hit is not expected.
By default this takes on the value 1.5 which is slightly higher than the internal trace profiler due to the decrease in initial buffer size.
By default, ::testing::internal::PrintTo() is used for printing the value.
By default, FbsonJsonParserT creates a new FbsonWriterT object with an output stream object.
By default, RocksDB uses only one background thread for flush and compaction.
By default, all Put/Merge/Delete operations will be indexed in the transaction so that Get/GetForUpdate/GetIterator can search for these keys.
By default, all background jobs (major compaction and memtable flush) go to the LOW priority pool.
By default, an FbsonWriterT object creates an output stream buffer.
By default, assume pointer alignment.
By default, calling align() registers alignment metadata for relocation.
By default, compaction will only call Filter() on keys written after the most recent call to GetSnapshot().
By default, does nothing.
By default, don't care about the number of values in current window when decide whether to swap windows or not.
By default, it returns an iterator for prefix seek if prefix_extractor is configured in Options.
By default, it will call this object's destructor automatically, so everything will be free-d.
By default, jobs go to the 'LOW' priority thread pool.
By default, only raise an NSAssertion in debug mode (custom assert functions will still be called).
By default, print C string as pointers to be safe, as we don't know whether they actually point to a NUL-terminated string.
By default, static allocated buffer is used.
By default, sync only data.
By default, the auxiliary * write ahead log and shared memory files used for transaction control * are automatically deleted when the latest connection to the database * closes.
By default, the buffer capacity is 1024 bytes.
By default, the instructions may, or may not set the CPU status flags.
By default, the internal pointer is null.
By default, the windows VFS will retry file read, * file write, and file delete operations up to 10 times, with a delay * of 25 milliseconds before the first retry and with the delay increasing * by an additional 25 milliseconds with each subsequent retry.
By default, this / is the target triple, but this may be overridden to accommodate some / platforms.
By default, we assume that stream redirection is supported on all platforms except known mobile ones.
By default, we set it to true for MANIFEST writes and false for WAL writes
By default, we use the standard "extern" declarations.
By default, when you gen() instructions that could throw, IRBuilder automatically creates catch blocks that take the current frame-state information, except spill the stack as if the instruction has not yet started.
By definition, this maps 'FOO' to 'CanFOO'.
By doing it, we give max_bytes_for_level_multiplier a priority against max_bytes_for_level_base, for a more predictable LSM tree shape.
By inheriting OpaqueNSError, the SwiftError structure reserves enough space within itself to lazily emplace an NSError instance, and gets Core Foundation's refcounting scheme.
By making sure BOOST_HAS_TR1_TUPLE is undefined, we force Boost to use its own tuple implementation.
By overriding  * system calls with functions under its control, a test program can * simulate faults and error conditions that would otherwise be difficult * or impossible to induce.
By putting a wrapper around the null pointer, it makes / it more likely that the null pointer case will be handled correctly.
By referring to the offset of the global offset table entry for a symbol, instead of directly referring to the symbol, compiler-emitted data structures avoid requiring unnecessary relocation at dynamic linking time.
By setting ROCKSDB_XFUNC_TEST, all XFUNC_TEST having that value in the condition field will be executed.
By tracing up the loop nest / hierarchy by these loop exits, we can find the unreachable regions in the / parent and ignore them.
By using HPHP::String instead of other string types, we are able to build maps where we just reuse them so we avoid copying.

Currently does not affect the modes e/f, only g/k/H, as those have a different limit enforced at another level (see NDIG in php_conv_fp()).
Currently it only contains version information (1-byte).
Currently just prints to stderr, but we might eventually want to support other ways of reporting the error.
Currently not supported in open source.

Currently only used / for compiling the stdlib.
Currently only used by the CallArray instruction.
Currently only used when switching modes for hphpd_break, fb_enable_code_coverage, and xdebug_start_code_coverage.
Currently only variables can be static.
Currently string hash is 31-bit, thus it saves us some instructions to encode int keys as a negative hash, so that we don't have to care about the MSB when working with strhash_t.
Currently the layout of this array kind is set up to match MixedArray, with some of the fields uninitialized to make the code path that transitions from struct to mixed cheaper.
Currently the most basic encoder/decode only works for integral types.
Currently there are three situations in which this happens: * The record has an invalid CRC (ReadPhysicalRecord reports a drop) * The record is a 0-length record (No drop is reported) * The record is below constructor's initial_offset (No drop is reported)
Currently there is only one such flag - * SQLITE_INDEX_SCAN_UNIQUE.

Currently this only exists to be / transformed into a FunctionTypeRepr by simplifyTypeExpr() in Sema.
Currently this process relies on some information from HPHPc.
Currently we don't *really* compile on anything other than gcc or sometimes clang, and there are some parts of the code using __attribute__ stuff directly, but some things go through these macros to make it maybe easier to change later.
Currently we don't ever relocate anything from frozen (or prof).
Currently we don't support: * reserve()/shrink_to_fit() If used correctly, in most cases, people should not touch the underlying vector at all.
Currently we handle this by using these global pointers, which must be set up before you use those parts of the runtime.
Currently we keep a fixed size buffer.
Currently we support at most 50 types in a list, and at most 50 type-parameterized tests in one type-parameterized test case.
Currently we support two types of tables: plain table and block-based table.
Currently, RocksDB assigns low-pri to request from compaciton and high-pri to request from flush.
Currently, RocksDB does not enforce rate limit for anything other than flush and compaction, e.g. write to WAL.
Currently, RuntimeFunction.def uses the following calling conventions: DefaultCC, RegisterPreservingCC.
Currently, Values() supports from 1 to 50 parameters.
Currently, a Type which supports multiple specializations is trivial along all of them.
Currently, changing one of the following options will fail the compatibility check:
Currently, does not invalidate pointers or references to elements at indexes less than InternalSize, but we don't want to depend on this without documenting it here.
Currently, only storage and function decls can be static/class.
Currently, subscripts are never static.
Currently, there is no deadlock-detection to recover from a deadlock.
Currently, this function will return Status::MergeInProgress if the most recent write to the queried key in this batch is a Merge.
Currently, this is always src(0).
Currently, when you have a mix of Put()s and Merge()s on a same key, we only guarantee to process the merge operands through the compaction filters.
Currently, you can only define an index on a single field.
Curry thunks are never foreign.

Example of such code are decref helpers that free objects when the ref-count goes to zero.
Example: "c2chars/nints" will return an object with fields chars1, chars2, and ints.
Example: FilePath("dir/file.exe").RemoveExtension("EXE") returns FilePath("dir/file").

Example: Let's say you have backups 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and you restore 3.
Example: Two pointers pointing to non-overlapping /          memory ranges.
Examples are methodCacheSlowPath or loadArrayFunctionContext.
Examples include compaction and flush.
Examples of these include Service Request stubs (executed once), Catch blocks (highly unlikely), and cold code emitted in profiling mode (which become dead after optimized code is emitted).
Examples: 'dir/foo_test.xml' or 'dir/foo_test_1.xml'.
Excellent for allocating small blocks during the compiling, and no need to worry about freeing them.

FastCGI ABORT_REQUEST prematurely terminates a request, signaling that the webserver is no longer interested in processing it.
FastCGI BEGIN_REQUEST intiates a new http request.
FastCGI END_REQUEST is sent to the webserver to mark the completion of a request it contains the exit code for the request as well as the a protocol defined status field indicating the reason the request was terminated, the contentData is structured as follows-  uint32: appStatus (the exit code) uint8 : protocolStatus (the reason) XXXXX : reserved (3 bytes)
FastCGI GET_VALUES and GET_VALUES_RESULT are used to communicate the capabilities of the application server to the webserver.
FastCGI PARAMS is a /stream/ record consisting of name-value pairs which inform the application server of request parameters.
FastCGI Records fall into two three categories:  Structured records contain a fixed contentData structure with values at specific offsets and numeric data encoded in big-endian form.
FastCGI Records have a common header, all multibyte values are big endian:  uint8 : version uint8 : type uint16: requestId uint16: contentLength (between 0 and 65535) uint8 : paddingLength (between 0 and 255) uint8 : reserved XXXXX : contentData (contentLength many bytes) XXXXX : paddingData (paddingLength many bytes)  The sender is not required to send padding bytes, the receiver must ignore them if sent.
FastCGI STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR, and DATA are /stream/ records containing unstructured data.
FastCGI UNKNOWN_TYPE is sent from an application that has received a record it does not understand.
FastCGI client API
FastCGI key-value pairs are structured data with variable size length fields.
FastCGI protocol
FastCGI sends all data over the wire in big-endian format.
FastCGIAcceptor accepts new connections from a listening socket, wrapping each one in a FastCGISession.
FastCGIJob is used by FastCGIServer to enqueue jobs once a request has received all of its headers.
FastCGIServer uses a FastCGIAcceptor to listen for new connections from FastCGI webservers.
FastCGISession callbacks
FastCGISession has an absurd number of callbacks to handle asynchronous reading and writing on its socket, and communication with the FastCGITransport that runs the request.
FastCGISession tracks the state of an active connection with a FastCGI webserver.
FastCGITransport is used to communicate between a PHP (VM) thread running a FastCGI request and the FastCGISession representing the connection to the client.
Fault interrogation funcs
Fbml is currently the lowest ranked lock because we reenter the VM while holding it.
FbsonDocument is the main object that accesses and queries FBSON packed bytes.

FbsonOutBuffer is a streambuf used internally if the input is raw character buffer.
FbsonToJson converts an FbsonValue object to a JSON string.
FbsonType defines 10 primitive types and 2 container types, as described below.
FbsonValue is the base class of all FBSON types.

For each loop, we / run the evaluator on the loop and then use the ARCPairingContext to pair / retains/releases and eliminate them.
For each node, we maintain two singly linked lists:
For each of the exiting regions of the subloop (that is the regions / inside the loop that leave the subloop): / /   a.
For each of the removed edges additionally we / introduce an "exiting edge".

For efficiency reasons, we don't represent the details of the object here.
For encoding type kPrefix, the value will be used when writing to determine an interval to rewrite the full key.
For error reporting.
For every argument in the function, check to see whether all epilogue / releases are found.
For example a "mutating set" accessor.
For example, "bar///foo" becomes "bar/foo".
For example, * it might allocate any require mutexes or initialize internal data * structures.
For example, *A*:Foo.* is a filter that matches any string that contains the character 'A' or starts with "Foo.".
For example, / if the primary locator refers to a function argument, the target locator / will be set to refer to the corresponding function parameter.
For example, OS X is / considered active when the target operating system is OS X and app extension / restrictions are enabled, but OSXApplicationExtension is not considered / active when the target platform is OS X and app extension restrictions are / disabled.
For example, a /     computed variable can still be fragile, meaning that it is known /     to be implemented with a getter/setter.
For example, a / refinement context covering an IfStmt Then branch will have the / IfStmt as the introduction node (and its reason as IfStmtThenBranch) / but its source range will cover the Then branch.
For example, a ClassStatement generates different source code, depending on whether we are generating a header file or an implementation file.
For example, a Type only supports SpecKind::Class if its bits intersect nontrivially with kAnyObj.
For example, a basic block may appear to have a single predecessor, but that may be because a different predecessor has not yet been added.
For example, a cache where the values are variable length strings, may use the length of the string as the charge for the string.
For example, a negative month number will result in the return of zero for the SDN.
For example, a test case for the Foo class can be named FooTest.
For example, a user breakpoint has been reached, or a step command has completed.
For example, all heap objects have a pointer to some metadata describing it, so pointers to class instances can eventually lead to their metadata.
For example, an application * that does not care about crash recovery or rollback might make * the open of a journal file a no-op.
For example, for ASSERT_EQ(foo, bar) where foo is 5 and bar is 6, we have:
For example, for member / variables, there should be separate callbacks for adding a / getter/setter pair, for just adding a getter, and for adding a / physical projection (if we decide to support that).
For example, for variable references it is the / variable type, for function calls it is the return type.
For example, four registers can be used as scratch registers and the fifth one as saved register on the architecture above.
For example, function ids, class ids, string literal ids.
For example, given:
For example, if Foo() calls Bar(), which in turn calls GetCurrentOsStackTraceExceptTop(..., 1), Foo() will be included in the trace but Bar() and GetCurrentOsStackTraceExceptTop() won't.
For example, if a regular thread_local variable A is declared in DBImpl, two DBImpl objects would share the same A.
For example, if an application specifies kBlockCacheTier then the Get call will process data that is already processed in the memtable or the block cache.
For example, if an element is unset, the MArrayIter's that were pointing to that element are moved to point to the element before the element being unset.
For example, if connection X is waiting for * connection Y's transaction to be concluded, and similarly connection * Y is waiting on connection X's transaction, then neither connection * will proceed and the system may remain deadlocked indefinitely.
For example, if the PreClass "extends Foo", and Foo is defined differently in different requests, we will make a different Class.
For example, if the comparator ignores trailing spaces, it would be incorrect to use a FilterPolicy (like NewBloomFilterPolicy) that does not ignore trailing spaces in keys.
For example, if the number of table steps greatly exceeds * the number of table searches or result rows, that would tend to indicate * that the prepared statement is using a full table scan rather than * an index.
For example, if this is a VarDecl for "x", the pattern / may be "(x, y)" and the initializer on the PatternBindingDecl may be / "(1,2)" or "foo()".
For example, if this is a VarDecl for "x", the pattern may be / "(x, y)" and the initializer on the PatternBindingDecl may be "(1,2)" or / "foo()".
For example, if we need to break for the debugger, or enable code coverage mode.
For example, if you define IsEven predicate:
For example, in Json, inside an array, entries are not keyed.
For example, in: /   (Int, ((Float, (), Double))) / the Int member is numbered 0, the Float is numbered 1, and the Double is / numbered 2.
For example, it can eliminate redundant guards.
For example, it could be a resilient struct or / something of unknown size.
For example, it is not suggested to do DB::CompactFiles() (as it may run for a long while) or issue many of DB::Put() (as Put may be blocked in certain cases) in the same thread in the EventListener callback.
For example, it is the RocksDB background flush thread that does the actual flush to call EventListener::OnFlushCompleted().
For example, it transforms
For example, something like void __cdecl function(....) might be needed.
For example, suffix would be "5" for the property "rocksdb.num-files-at-level5".
For example, the copy constructor is not a copy constructor (it unboxes refs and converts KindOfUninit to KindOfNull).
For example, the length of a single-character repeat may vary in UTF-8 mode.
For example, the value of "key" will be "v3" after the following batch is written:
For example, this instantiates tests from test case BarTest each with values "one", "two", and "three":
For example, this would be reasonable to use to describe the unoccupied bits in a memory layout.
For example, type definitions inside functions are relatively rare, and also expensive to find (because there are so many functions), so the parser may not make the effort to find these.
For example, we can simultaneously compute the avg of some counter value over the last 5 minutes, 10 minutes and hour.
For example, we may know the name of a class in a res::Class, but do not know for sure which php::Class struct is actually associated with it.
For example, we use Timers for optimize, optimize_dce, optimize_jumpOpts, and others.
For example, when rate_bytes_per_sec is set to 10MB/s and refill_period_us is set to 100ms, then 1MB is refilled every 100ms internally.
For example, when the host instruction / is known to correspond to the beginning or the end of the source / range of the ASTNode.
For example, you can define a global variable like this:
For example, you could use it to verify the size of a static array:
For example:
For example: methods, properties, class constants.
For examples, properties from base classes or a global variable.
For executors that support it, this method can be used to add a synchronous callback function for communicating with the javascript context.
For external use with Q_Iter* funcs

For regions selected for inlining, track the types of input arguments
For remembering malloc'd frames
For resilient classes this does not / correspond to the runtime alignment of instances of the class.
For safety, the ctor can be private, and the hybrid declared a friend of its base, so the hybrid can only be created from here.
For scanning objects in the request heap, scanByIndex() should instead by used.
For separate compilation These add edges between filescopes in the other dep graph and save the symbols for our iface.
For setbuffer.
For simple types (e.g. int, string, C, etc.) m_typeArgs and m_typeList are null and the name is all we need.
For simplicity, the current implementation doesn't search the PATH when launching the sub-process.
For simplicity, we limit such kinds to use / no more than 4 bits.
For small numbers of elements, use insertion sort
For some Swift decls there / are multiple SIL entry points, and the kind is used to distinguish them.
For some forms of checked / cast this is different from the result type of the expression.
For some non-soft constraints (such as "Stringish"), this function may return a Type that is a strict supertype of the constraint's type.
For sorting PackedArray and Vector
For static allocation purposes (such as allocation on stack, or freestanding systems without malloc()), use the structure XXH32_stateSpace_t, which will ensure that memory space is large enough and correctly aligned to access 'long long' fields.
For static mutexes, we rely on these members being initialized to zeros by the linker.
For static properties, this means setting up request-local memory for the actual static properties, if necessary, and initializing them to their default values.

For testing
For testing purposes.
For that, use the / emitReleaseValueOperation method below or use the TypeLowering API.
For the case in which this is used in swift / currently, we use 3 index bits meaning that on a 32 bit system we have 26 / bits for representing indices meaning we can represent indices up to / 67_108_862.
For the case of compiled-on-4 and run-on-8, we include an extra pointer that is always NULL so that there are an even number of pointers which therefore are a multiple of 8 bytes.

For the specfied level, pick a file that we want to compact.
For the test SequenceA/FooTest.DoBar/1 FooTest is test case base name and DoBar is test base name.
For the timer mode:  Xenon appends a timer to the already existing SIGVTALRM handler.
For the x64 version, this class relies on the x64 property that a "canonical form" address must have all the upper bits set to the same value as bit 47.
For these instructions, an additional byte (0x0F) is emitted before the standard opcode byte.
For this error enum, extract the name of the error domain constant
For this reason, and also to make the code easier to maintain, the storing and loading of offsets from the byte string is now handled by the macros that are defined here.
For this reason, its important to call init() as early as possible.
For this reason, the block should always return new module instances, and module instances should not be shared between bridges.
For this set of locations, when the instruction executes (before any of its other effects), it becomes semantically illegal for any part of the program to read from those locations again (without writing to them first).
For those brushes we override applyFillColor which sets the fill color to be used by those batch paints.
For toggle items, the handler will be called immediately after the item is added if the item was already selected when the module was last loaded.
For tracing purposes this just needs to be unique, pthread_t is not portable but even if it's a pointer to a struct like on OSX this will produce a unique value.
For two byte opcodes
For unbuffered (both normal and PS)
For universal-style compaction, you can usually set it to -1.
For updates/writes of values that will expand the original FBSON size, the write will fail, and the caller needs to handle buffer increase.

GO_ARGS indicates that the Go prototype for this assembly function defines the pointer map for the function's arguments.
GO_ARGS is inserted implicitly by the linker for any function that also has a Go prototype and therefore is usually not necessary to write explicitly.
GO_ARGS should be the first instruction in a function that uses it.
GO_ARGS, GO_RESULTS_INITIALIZED, and NO_LOCAL_POINTERS are macros that communicate to the runtime information about the location and liveness of pointers in an assembly function's arguments, results, and stack frame.
GO_RESULTS_INITIALIZED indicates that the assembly function has initialized the stack space for its results and that those results should be considered live for the remainder of the function.

Generally they will have nullptr for their exnNode pointers, however, although they may also have other EH-protected regions inside of them (this currently occurs in the case of php-level finally blocks cloned into fault funclets).
Generally this requires / special logic in the importer.
Generally you have to check thisIsAvailable() before assuming it can't be null.
Generally you should be able to figure out if your key is a pure string (not-integer-like) or not when using ArrayInit, and if not you should probably use toKey yourself.
Generally you should not be talking to the GlobalsArray directly (see php-globals.h).
Generally, a statically-emitted relative reference can only be direct if it can be resolved to a constant offset by the linker, because loaders do not support forming relative references.
Generally, functions are not inlined unless optimization is specified.
Generally, however, we don't create a variable environment for global functions or methods until it actually needs one (i.e. if it is about to include a pseudo-main, or if it uses dynamic variable lookups).

However the key may exists already a be a primed mapped to file entry
However we must take into account mutually referential objects.
However when it's being build (in hhbbc) it's creating them in parallel, and probably will lots of duplicate types.
However you will need to ensure that the endianness at the reader side is the same as that at the writer side (if they are on different machines).
However, * failure to zero-fill short reads will eventually lead to * database corruption.
However, * for maximum code portability it is recommended that applications * still make the distinction between protected and unprotected * sqlite3_value objects even when not strictly required.
However, 4 registers are virtual on x86-32.
However, HHVM allows arrays to be shared by multiple things (and it uses refcounting to keep track of how many things own a reference to the array).
However, I might not be the case in the future
However, I received a request for an even bigger limit.
However, PCRE can also be compiled to use 3 or 4 bytes instead.
However, Push() will also "write the current item to the result".
However, a ThreadLocalPtr that is defined under the scope of DBImpl can avoid such confliction.
However, a non-prefix query like '1st' *   will match against "1st" and "first".
However, all EventListener call-back functions should not run for an extended period of time before the function returns, otherwise RocksDB may be blocked.
However, almost all the bits in a 32-bit word are now used, so in order to conserve them, option bits that were previously only recognized at matching time (i.e. by pcre_exec() or pcre_dfa_exec()) may also be used for compile-time options that affect only compiling and are not relevant for studying or JIT compiling.
However, almost all the bits in the options word are now used.
However, because *   extra entries are added to the FTS index, this method uses more space *   within the database.
However, being able to / propagate Expr*s is also important because there are several kinds / of expressions (such as closures) which can be emitted more / efficiently with a known target abstraction level.
However, chances are some of the backups are consistent.
However, deleting a move assignment operator causes the copy constructor to be implicitly deleted, and its still passed in registers.
However, doing DB::CompactFiles() and DB::Put() in a thread other than the EventListener callback thread is considered safe.
However, doing DB::CompactFiles() and DB::Put() in another thread is considered safe.
However, experience has shown that many of * these result codes are too coarse-grained.
However, flags that only have a single value may / (and should) be overwritten by this method.
However, for performance reasons, we need to make sure certain functions get inlined.
However, if the / addition of a member is delayed---for example, because it's / being introduced in response to name lookup---this method can be / called to make it immediately visible.
However, if the compaction filter overrides IgnoreSnapshots to make it return false, the compaction filter will be called even if the keys were written before the last snapshot.
However, if the database file is being synced * as part of a multi-database commit, the argument points to a nul-terminated * string containing the transactions master-journal file name.
However, if the mutex is hot, we could end up wasting spin time.
However, if we throw, the unwinder won't think we're in the FPI region yet.
However, in case where the static variable inside Instance() goes out of scope, MemberMutex() should be used.
However, in the final pass, other threads might be optimizing a callee's bytecode and changing it, so we should not be reading from it to perform type inference concurrently.
However, it *   does not support prefix queries very well.
However, it also requires the cases to be dynamically distinguished.
However, it can be recovered from the instructions that need to do so.
However, it causes trouble with GCC and thus needs to be conditionally compiled.
However, it does not always fully describe / the abstraction pattern.
However, it does not seems very useful, because a conversion to null always results in the same value.
However, it does not work on non-jailbroken iOS devices, although the compilation is successful.
However, it doesn't matter if they're placed in a public/protected/private section.
However, it expects to allocate raw memory of N bytes, while the standard allocator interface allocates N instances of type T.
However, it is extremely useful to / represent this as a distinct type in SIL and IR-generation.
However, it is inadequate when the expression does / not provide structure at the appropriate level, i.e. when that / level is substituted in: when the original type is merely T.
However, it is legal for rTmp to be a source for some other destination.
However, it is often used as system time such as in GenericRateLimiter and other places so a port needs to return system time in order to work.
However, it is still possible to return to the address of the caller (or anywhere else).
However, it needn't support multiple concurrent writes.
However, methods that deal with initializing and destructing Pairs needs to handle intermediate states where one or both of the elements is uninitialized.
However, multiple filters may be in existence and operating concurrently.
However, negative block IDs logically correspond to blocks without associated translations---hence, negative TransID's are simply invalid.
However, new applications should avoid * the use of these functions.
However, note that the end / location is the start of the last token in the range, not the last character / in the range.
However, notice that the new types may result in inconsistent operand types for instructions that are unreachable (but not yet removed from the IR unit).
However, other types may still refer to them (though this is very rare), so they need to be represented somehow without actually parsing them.
However, recall / that the Pattern may be involved in initializing more than just this one / vardecl.
However, since we don't have back pointers to find them, instead we leave the Class in a zombie state.
However, some code fragments (like inline cache) may have no normal entry point so their context is unknown for the compiler.
However, sometimes the LF (0x25) character is used instead, according to this Unicode document: http://unicode.org/standard/reports/tr13/tr13-5.html PCRE defaults EBCDIC NL to 0x15, but has a build-time option to select 0x25 instead.
However, such calls must not * close the database connection nor finalize or reset the prepared * statement in which the function is running.
However, the CPU might not ignore those higher 32 bits, like MIPS, which expects it to be the sign extension of the lower 32 bit.
However, the Zend resource can be freed before ZendResourceData is released.
However, the automatic detection is not perfect.
However, the names aren't sufficient to determine equality of two different object types.
However, the parser will not include it in serialization and verification processes.
However, the portions of the HHIR program that may use that memory location in either of those ways may not overlap, based on the HHBC semantics of function calls and eval stack usage.
However, the stack is a little more complicated.
However, the two may differ in cases where user code has modified the inner cell to be a different array or non-array value.
However, there is no compile-time way of detecting whether they are enabled or not.
However, they are 'committed' to the manifest in FIFO order to maintain correctness and recoverability from a crash.
However, they shouldn't persist in the AST, and / don't need to be parsed, printed, or serialized.
However, they're only profitable if there wasn't any other indirect reference to the target, and it is likely that their optimal use requires a more intelligent toolchain from top to bottom.
However, this can be / solved dynamically by applying thunks with a runtime function that / can recognize and bypass its own previous handiwork.
However, this initialization can be shared among all indirect references within the linkage unit, and the linker will generally place all such references adjacent to one another to improve load-time locality.
However, this return value does not indicate that there is no more memory (does not set the current error code of the compiler to out-of-memory status).
However, this would require a fancier hash table, and the simple solution seemed like a good place to start.
However, we cannot cast it to const void* directly, even using reinterpret_cast, as earlier versions of gcc (e.g. 3.4.5) cannot compile the cast when p is a function pointer.
However, we do use a variable to ensure that the expression passed into val will be evaluated before* switching back contexts.
However, we guarantee consistent ThreadStatusData all the time whenever user call GetThreadList().
However, we guarantee precise representation of any single ID, and any subset of of IDs below 62.
However, we leave the interface to the outside world as char * or short *, because that should make things easier for callers.
However, we strongly recommend you to write your own main() and call AddGlobalTestEnvironment() there, as relying on initialization of global variables makes the code harder to read and may cause problems when you register multiple environments from different translation units and the environments have dependencies among them (remember that the compiler doesn't guarantee the order in which global variables from different translation units are initialized).
However, when loading from an Objective-C object, / this metadata may not have the heap-metadata header, and it may / not be the Swift type metadata for the object's dynamic type.
However, whenever we have a value, the type of the SSATmp must match this `type' field.
However, while the pin / is held, the code is considered within a "critical region".
However, you always need to specify default column family.
However, you can also pass in your FbsonWriterT or any stream object that implements some basic interface of std::ostream (see FbsonStream.h).
However, you can use the static method "createValue" to get any FbsonValue object from the packed bytes.

If the array is a copy, pending changes are discarded.
If the background color is not specified the video compositor will use a default backgroundColor of opaque black.

If we have undef, just remap the type.
If we haven't defined sint2korr, which is because the platform is not x86 or it's WIN64
If we instead put its logic inside the previous ArrayEq() function, arrays with different sizes would lead to different copies of the template code.
If we instead put its logic inside the previous CopyArray() function, arrays with different sizes would lead to different copies of the template code.

If we're doing an optimized translation, it also holds the TransID for the profiling translation associated with this piece of code.
If we're in debug mode, switch on the type and call the appropriate function directly.
If we're in debug mode, turn the entry into null so that the GC doesn't assert if it tries to follow it.

If you absolutely must add more methods to Func here, just follow these simple guidelines:
If you accidentally use PCRE or POSIX extended regex features not implemented by us, you will get a run-time failure.
If you add a case here, the diagnostics must be updated as well.
If you add new data to the DB and try creating a new backup now, the database will diverge from backups 4 and 5 and the new backup will fail.
If you allocated this, you need to free it yourself
If you are compiling for a system other than a Unix-like system or Win32, and it needs some magic to be inserted before the definition of a function that is exported by the library, define this macro to contain the relevant magic.
If you are compiling for a system that uses EBCDIC instead of ASCII character codes, define this macro to any value.
If you are designing an interface or concept, you can define a suite of type-parameterized tests to verify properties that any valid implementation of the interface/concept should have.
If you are going to build PCRE "by hand" without using "configure" or CMake, you should copy the distributed config.h.generic to config.h, and then edit the macro definitions to be the way you need them.
If you are going to end up casting the stream into a FILE* or a socket, pass this flag and the streams/wrappers will not use buffering mechanisms while reading the headers, so that HTTP wrapped streams will work consistently.
If you are inserting blocks in the CFG, generally speaking you should consider a LoopAnalysis invalidated.
If you are seeing out-of-memory crashes, try reducing this value.
If you are the client, close the connection.
If you are the server, respond with the "Connection: close" header.
If you are unlucky enough to need to know how this works, look up "SFINAE".

If you change this enum, also change / the OBJC_ATTR_SELECT macro in DiagnosticsSema.def.
If you change this file, please regenerate the zend_vm_execute.h and zend_vm_opcodes.h files by running: php zend_vm_gen.php
If you change this, change getSemanticType() too.
If you change this, change getSemanticTypeLowering() too.
If you do not define GTEST_HAS_GLOBAL_STRING, it is defined heuristically.
If you do not define this macro, PCRE will assume input strings are ASCII or UTF-8/16/32 Unicode.
If you don't call this, all exceptions will be returned as UnknownError.
If you don't care about formatting, you can use the more restrictive version:
If you don't need to write to the stream, but really need to be able to seek, use this flag in your options.
If you don't plan to run RocksDB before version 3.10, you should probably use this.
If you easily know the size of the allocation at free time, it might be more efficient to use MM() apis directly.
If you expect your predicate to be reused and want to support informative messages in EXPECT_FALSE and ASSERT_FALSE (negative assertions show up about half as often as positive ones in our tests), supply messages for both success and failure cases:
If you have an implicit location, use createImplicit.
If you have small UI component, it's often easier to configure it in a test and compare an image of the view to a reference image that write lots of complex layout-code tests.
If you know that the either is non-null, this is reasonable.
If you mark a column as an int, PDO expects get_col to return a pointer to a long
If you need to pass image references, try to use `RCTImageSource` and then `RCTImageLoader` instead of converting directly to a UIImage.
If you need to test that a function has appropriate side-effects in opt mode, include assertions against the side-effects.
If you need to unpin the array manually, call the / release() or abort() functions.
If you omit this flag, streams will use buffering and should end up working more optimally.
If you release DB mutex in body, reference the column family before the mutex and unreference after you unlock, since the column family might get dropped when the DB mutex is released * GetDefault() -- thread safe * GetColumnFamily() -- either inside of DB mutex or from a write thread * GetNextColumnFamilyID(), GetMaxColumnFamily(), UpdateMaxColumnFamily(), NumberOfColumnFamilies -- inside of DB mutex
If you see an error about overriding the following function or about it being private, you have mis-spelled SetUp() as Setup().
If you use a lambda here, copy things into the lambda by value.
If you use gtest_main, you need to call this before main() starts for it to take effect.
If you use snapshot feature of RocksDB (i.e. call GetSnapshot() API on a DB* object), CompactionFilter might not be very useful for you.
If you use these macros, you must perform your own bounds checking.
If you use this function, make sure you copy/write the correct data on the hash table afterwards.
If you want to builder full filter, it needs to be set to false.
If you want to care about a new kind of memory effect, you get to re-audit everything---have fun.
If you want to create new backup, you will first have to delete backups 4 and 5.
If you want to make changes to the property array, we need to keep its ref count at 1.
If you want to see if the set is unbounded, use `hasUpperRange()' instead.
If you're increasing this, also consider increasing number of threads in HIGH priority thread pool.
If you're increasing this, also consider increasing number of threads in LOW priority thread pool.
If you're not sure, use add() instead.
If you're not sure, use set() instead.
If you're running RocksDB on spinning disks, you should set this to at least 2MB.
If you're storing map data, different spatial index granularities can be used for different zoom levels.
If your data is larger, use the advanced functions below.
If your updates are random across the key space, write amplification is slightly better with this option.

In SILType.h
In Swift, we always prefer to use a near direct relative reference when it is possible to do so: that is, when the relationship is always between two global objects emitted in the same linkage unit, and there is no compatibility constraint requiring the use of an absolute reference.

In all other modes, including the normal 32-bit library, the macros all have the same simple definitions.
In an EBCDIC environment, define this macro to any value to arrange for the NL character to be 0x25 instead of the default 0x15.
In an basic scenario where a client is debugging a remote VM, the VM will create a proxy when the client connects (via DebuggerServer) and listen for commands via this proxy.
In an effort to * address this, newer versions of SQLite (version 3.3.8 and later) include * support for additional result codes that provide more detailed information * about errors.
In an indirect reference, the direct referent is a variable holding an absolute reference to the object.
In any case, default to NOPs for the macros and hope the generated code will behave as planned.
In both ASCII and EBCDIC environments the value can also be -1 (ANY), or -2 (ANYCRLF).
In both ASCII and EBCDIC environments, CHAR_NL and CHAR_LF are synonyms for the same code point.
In both cases, the cycle is passed as a NodeRange whose underlying storage is invalidated when the Live or Leaked returns.
In builtins, m_fp points to the caller's frame if called through FCallBuiltin, else it points to the builtin's frame, in which case, getPrevVMState() gets the caller's frame.
In case T is not an enum, printing it as an integer is the best we can do given that it has no user-defined printer.
In case an exception interrupts the initialization.
In case of a collision during inserting the key, the builder tries to insert the key in other locations of the cuckoo block before using the next hash function.
In case of collision while inserting, the builder attempts to insert in the next cuckoo_block_size locations before skipping over to the next Cuckoo hash function.
In case of compaction error, reset the nextIndex that is used to pick up the next file to be compacted from files_by_size_
In case of error caller is responsible to cleanup the value (i.e. calling "deleter").
In case of error value will be cleanup.
In case of multi-threaded compilation, the compile-action produces multiple output bitcode-files.
In case of shift by register it supports only SLJIT_R2 for shift argument (which is the src2 argument of sljit_emit_op2).
In case s.ok() is true, then this function will not throw any exception.
In case that ever happens we need an additional flag.
In case the compaction will compact the whole range, compaction_end will be set to nullptr.
In case the implementation lists the directory prior to iterating the files and files are concurrently deleted, the deleted files will be omitted from result.
In case there was no multi-children node (linear tree), we just add a pair (pointer to leaf node, pointer to child node), with the child node being in a direct path from leaf to this node.
In case they didn't start from ClearSilver.h.
In case this attempt to disclaim copyright and place the software in the public domain is deemed null and void, then the software is Copyright (c) 2000-2011 Solar Designer and it is hereby released to the general public under the following terms:  Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted.
In case we go into a new `yield from` level, a node is created on top of current root and becomes the new root.
In case you have multiple column families, even if flush_memtable is true, you still need to call GetSortedWalFiles after GetLiveFiles to compensate for new data that arrived to already-flushed column families while other column families were flushing
In cases other than emit.cpp, this is not required for correctness, but is slightly better than always traversing the factored exit edges.
In cases where the comparator does not impose a strict weak ordering or the comparator throws, no guarantees are made about the order of the elements produced the sort algorithm, though the algorithm still upholds a weaker guarantee that the result will be some permutation of the input.
In cases where they may return reference counted types, the value is already incRef'd when returned.
In certain cases (trivial move or preload), the filter block may already be cached, but we still do not access it such that it eventually expires from the cache.
In certain cases this was before all Modules had been loaded / causing us to not
In certan case, it is desirable to alter the underlying options when the TableFactory is not used by any open DB by casting the returned pointer to the right class.
In contrast to LLVM IR, SILDebugScope also holds all / the inlining information.
In contrast to inline scopes, this generates a / deep copy of the scope tree.
In contrast, / the MetatypeType for a ProtocolType is a singleton.
In contrast, BlotSetVector uses the `blot / operation' (a) which trades memory for runtime and index offset stability.
In describing the results of death tests, these terms are used with the corresponding definitions:
In either case, break off 'left' as the new root of the lower-bound tree.
In either case, it may or may not represent an actual file or directory in the file system.
In either case, the full layout of / values of the type is unavailable to the compiler.
In either case, we need to rotate 'cur' to become the new root of the lower tree.
In environments that support the facilities, config.h.in is converted by "configure", or config-cmake.h.in is converted by CMake, into config.h.
In exception parlance, this would be the equivalent of "catch".
In fact, it only supports six of the eight register args.
In fact, the only functions that may not have nativeFuncPtr's are Native (i.e., HNI) functions declared with NeedsActRec.
In general in RELEASE build ZEND_ASSERT() must be zero-cost, but for some reason, GCC generated worse code, performing CSE on assertion code and the following "slow path" and moving memory read operatins from slow path into common header.
In general the transport is around for as long as any of the session, the vm, or the server require access to it.
In general this method should be called after a speculative reserve and zero or more adds have been performed.
In general this method should be called after one or more elements have been removed.
In general, Mutex() should be used instead of this one.
In general, only the routines in SILGenLValue.cpp should actually be accessing LValues and their components.
In general, simplify() transforms one instruction into zero or more instructions.
In general, these macros are expected to expand to host-independent integer constant expressions.
In general, this is the / representation of the type which replaces all materializable / sub-expressions with a fresh type variable.
In level compaction, that is max_file_size_.
In many cases, a filter can cut down the number of disk seeks form a handful to a single disk seek per DB::Get() call.
In mmaped mode, the results point to mmaped area of the file, which means it is always valid before closing the file.
In more complicated hierarchies, however, it is occasionally useful to inherit separately from Test and WithParamInterface.
In most architectures it is implemented as an SLJIT_FCMP operation (setting appropriate flags) followed by a sljit_emit_jump.
In most architectures it is implemented as an SLJIT_SUB operation (with SLJIT_UNUSED destination and setting appropriate flags) followed by a sljit_emit_jump.
In most cases that just means inheriting from ::testing::TestWithParam, but more complicated test hierarchies may need to inherit from Test and WithParamInterface at different levels.
In most cases you want this to be set to true.
In most cases you will want to pass these arguments to the RCTFormatLog function in order to generate a string.
In most cases, Filter() will not be called very often.
In most cases, a set that cannot be precisely represented will be enlarged (as indicated by the presence of the upper range).
In most cases, the pointer argument passed with * this file-control is NULL.
In most of the case, you should use ThreadStatusUtil to update the status of the current thread instead of using ThreadSatusUpdater directly.
In multi-threaded compilation fetch the next IRGenModule from the queue.
In newer code you'll generally want to use raise_error.
In non-HH files the caller can specify whether param type-checking should be strict or weak.
In non-mmap mode, the results point to an internal buffer.
In normal cases, at least this percentage of data will be compressed.
In normal functions it will effectively be AStackAny, but in generators a return may still leave part of the eval stack alive for the caller.
In order so make this easy, all the exported functions have PCRE_CALL_CONVENTION just before their names.
In order to avoid any accidental transfer of state, Reset ASSERTs that the constant pool is not blocked.
In order to avoid complex error handling, only a minimum of validity checking is done to avoid crashing.
In order to avoid potentially filling the jni locals table, temporary objects (right now, this is just jstrings) need to be released.
In order to avoid these warnings, we need to use _snprintf or _snprintf_s on MSVC-based platforms.
In order to catch the mistake of putting tests that use different test fixture classes in the same test case, we need to assign unique IDs to fixture classes and compare them.
In order to correctly copy circular arrays, even if v is the only strong reference to arr, we still keep the reference.
In order to ensure that all the case lists remain in step, we use macros so that there is only one place where the lists are defined.
In order to handle fb_rename_function (when it is enabled), we need to invalidate dynamic function call caches (the FuncCache).
In order to invoke the connections * busy-handler, this function should be invoked with the second (void *) in * the array as the only argument.
In order to maintain * backwards compatibility with older code, these functions continue  * to be supported.
In order to prevent a circular module dependency between the core standard library and the Foundation overlay, we import these declarations as part of SwiftShims.
In order to save read calls to files, we keep two internal buffers: the first read and the most recent read.
In other words you must be sure that you really know the maximum size of the buffer required.
In other words, * the busy handler is not reentrant.
In other words, although a register can hold either a 64 or 32 bit value, these values cannot be mixed.
In other words, compaction will only call Filter() on keys written after your most recent call to GetSnapshot().
In other words, if the xUpdate() returns * SQLITE_CONSTRAINT, the database contents must be exactly as they were * before xUpdate was called.
In other words, it disables * all mutexing and puts SQLite into a mode where it can only be used * by a single thread.
In other words, it is possible to jump to any label from anywhere, even from a code fragment, which is compiled later, if both compiled code shares the same context.
In other words, it's the number of bytes of subclass data following the ObjectData subobject.
In other words, the block doesn't have a next edge, and it either has no taken edge or its taken edge goes to a catch block.
In other words, the soft heap limit  * is advisory only.
In our shutdown procedures
In particular it is possible for (1) the cached DOMNode object to be free'd before the xmlNode*, in which case the DOMNode is responsible for clearing the cache, and (2) for the underlying xmlNode* to be free'd while there are still req::ptr holding XMLNodeData resouces.
In particular, RemoveTrailingPathSeparator() only removes one separator, and it is called in CreateDirectoriesRecursively() assuming that it will change a pathname from directory syntax (trailing separator) to filename syntax.
In particular, Width::Any is returned for intrinsics, architecture-specific instructions, zero-extending or truncating reg moves, branches, pushes/pops, and floating-point conversions.
In particular, care should be taken to understand that the values of thesekeys will change even if we are using a snapshot.
In particular, deleted and overwritten versions are discarded, and the data is rearranged to reduce the cost of operations needed to access the data.
In particular, it fails if either val1 or val2 is NaN.
In particular, it parses a command line for the flags that Google Test recognizes.
In particular, it will not be persisted to the SST files.
In particular, iterators are provided to access the contents of a Table or a DB.
In particular, its destructor is not virtual.
In particular, outside of RepoAuth mode, trait methods are not transcluded into the Classes which use them, and we are conservative when initially counting methods since we do not resolve trait precedence first.
In particular, the / proxy in this iteration does not read a value and therefore does not create a LocalRef / until one of these other operators is used.
In particular, the number of free bytes and free blocks give a rough measure of fragmentation within the allocator.
In particular, the owner_ field (a pthread_t) is not explicitly initialized.
In particular, this function:
In particular, when the value is a C string (char pointer) and the other operand is an STL string object, we want to format the C string as a string, since we know it is compared by value with the string object.
In particular:
In php, it could be a boolean in old versions.
In place of * a legal notice, here is a blessing: * *    May you do good and not evil.
In practice it's almost impossible to hit this, unless Eval.JitRequireWriteLease is set.
In practice this is used in HPHP for process-lifetime cold runtime data.
In practice this means * that the application must guarantee that the disk file being  * backed up to is not accessed by any connection within the process, * not just the specific connection that was passed to sqlite3_backup_init().
In practice, this can be used to test functions that utilize the LOG(DFATAL) macro using the following style:
In practice, this is rarely a problem as for most containers const_iterator is a forward iterator.
In preparation for the future implementation of this mode, there are macros that load a data item and, if in this special mode, mask it to 21 bits.
In principle, people compiling for non-Windows, non-Unix-like (i.e. uncommon, special-purpose environments) might want to stick other stuff in front of exported symbols.
In prior versions of SQLite, * sharing was enabled or disabled for each thread separately.
In reality, these are by definition unique, but we use the non-unique flag to make merging more efficient.
In release mode (SLJIT_DEBUG is not defined) only the following external functions are needed:
In repo mode, we flatten traits into the classes they're used in, so we need this to track the original file for backtraces and errors.
In slowdown mode, next write needs to sleep if it uses up the quota.
In some applications, it would be better to match *   all instances of "first place" or "1st place" regardless of which form *   the user specified in the MATCH query text.
In some cases for re-entry, we're checking for space other than just the callee, and `extraCells' may need to be passed with a non-zero value.
In some cases we might want to trigger layout from native side.
In some cases, might not be valid until fetch (at the driver level) has been called at least once.
In some cases, we may not have a BGC handy, in which case we should delegate to the inherited conformance for the decl context.
In some cases, when a key follows a previous key with the same prefix, instead of writing out the full key, it just writes out the size of the shared prefix, as well as other bytes, to save some bytes.
In some command line programs that use the repo, it is necessary to shut it down at some point in the process.
In some contexts this warning is false positive and needs to be suppressed.
In some environments it is desirable to limit the depth of recursive calls of match() more strictly, in order to restrict the maximum amount of stack (or heap, if NO_RECURSE is defined) that is used.
In such a case, the compiler might have gone so far / as to map the entire object readonly, or we might just want to avoid / dirtying memory unnecessarily.
In such a case, there is no point in exploding the argument.
In such a case, we return early returning S1 without any loss of generality.
In such cases, we should never crash and ideally when an element is unset we should be able to keep track of where we are in the array.
In that case cls is nullptr and the PropState fields are populated.
In that case we want AssertionResult's copy constructor to be used.
In that case, compaction_end will be set to the next key that needs compacting.
In that case, it falls back to pure binary search and total iterator seek is supported.
In that case, please try to rewrite your regular expression within the above syntax.
In that case, subcompaction from multiple threads may call a single CompactionFilter concurrently.
In that case, the * error code and message may or may not be set.
In that case, the attribute should not be considered, / the attribute node should be only used to retrieve source information.
In that case, the semantics differ: - In PHP7, you just get 0.
In that case, we feed MemTableInserter dummy ColumnFamilyHandle and enable it to call DBImpl methods
In that case, we reallocate buffer and delete the old one.
In that sense the value is safe to compare against in a less-than relationship.
In that state: *) Compaction and flush is not executed on the dropped column family.
In that way, accessing the iterator tree can be more cache friendly.
In the JIT, SSATmps of type Res are ResourceHdr pointers.
In the canonical representation, these are all ProtocolTypes.
In the case of an / "implicit optional" pattern, the OptionalSome pattern is explicitly added / to this as an 'implicit' pattern.
In the case of an exception it returns TInitCell.
In the case of copy assignment a new reference is created.
In the case of multiple incoming edges with the / same string, the kinds are combined into the one field.
In the case of profiling translations, these are sometimes freed eagerly when they become unreachable, as they will be erased from their associated SrcRec and are not tracked elsewhere.
In the case of resumable frames the sp offset is relative to Stack::resumableStackBase.
In the cases where vmsp also needs to be synced between translations (namely, in resumed contexts), we do this sync inline at the site of the jump to the stub, so that it still occurs once the jump gets smashed.
In the common case, a MArrayIter is bound to a RefData when it is initialized.
In the context of std smart pointers, these references behave like unique_ptr, and have basically the same interface.
In the current implementation the cache is traversed by a linear search from most-recent to least-recent.
In the default implementation, PartialMergeMulti will invoke PartialMerge multiple times, where each time it only merges two operands.
In the event of (1) the only reference to the free'd object will be the object in m_cache, and as such an raw ObjectData* is used as a quasi-weak pointer.
In the event of an error, this function will return / a negative value indicating a failure to execute.
In the event of an error, this function will return a negative / value indicating a failure to execute.
In the far future, only the attribute check will be needed.
In the following example all tests in the test case FlagDependentTest will be instantiated twice with parameters false and true.
In the following sample, tests from test case FooTest are instantiated each three times with parameter values 3, 5, and 8:
In the former case the client frees the memory.
In the former case the reader will immediately drop to the next level since nullptr sorts after all keys.
In the former case, the mixed_consumer member will always be nullptr, and the consumer parameter to these two following functions must be specified.
In the future, maybe some components will be cheaper (no loads, like loading from a superclass's metadata) or more expensive (multiple loads, or even a call).
In the future, this may become an / actual operation within the language.
In the future, we may restrict hdf_destroy so it only works on the top level node.
In the future, we may trim tests that are excluded because of sharding.
In the future, we plan to also support indexes on multiple keys, where you could mix ascending sorting (1) with descending sorting indexes (-1)
In the future, we plan to publish the API for defining new parameter generators.
In the implementation, we include the current line number as part of the dummy variable name, thus allowing multiple SCOPED_TRACE()s to appear in the same block - as long as they are on different lines.
In the latter case the destructor for CmdBreak frees the memory.
In the latter case the reader will use the new node.
In the latter case, the mixed_consumer member will always be specified, and the consumer parameter to these two following function must be nullptr.
In the long run, we may have to re-use some of the compile-time only bits for runtime options, or vice versa.
In the prelude of a generic function, perform the bindings for a / generics clause.
In the presence of inlining, these modify state for the most-inlined frame.
In the presence of inlining, these return state for the most-inlined frame.
In the requests executed before reaching this limit, the profile counters are set very high so that no retranslation in optimized mode is triggered.
In the special case that a loop pre-header is being inserted, if the pre_header fields in LoopInfo are maintained, calling this function will keep the rest of the LoopAnalysis valid as well.
In the unit test, 'Happens After' relationship among sync points could be setup via SyncPoint::LoadDependency, to reproduce a desired interleave of threads execution.
In the whitelist, empty_array means "allow no classes", while null_array means allow any classes.
In the wonderful new world of gd 2.0, you can of course have many more colors when using truecolor mode.
In theory, defining stuff in the ::std namespace is undefined behavior.
In these cases we represent the / conformance as a null ProtocolConformance* pointer, because there is no / static conformance associated with the conforming type.
In these situations, we set up a "strange marker" by calling updateMarker() before the instruction is done (but after the pre-live ActRec is pushed).
In this case SLJIT is clever enough to not generate any instructions if the source and destination operands are the same registers.
In this case it will fail back to normal cases.
In this case m_bodyData and m_clientComplete are protected by a lock.
In this case nullptr is returned.

In this case the raise offset of the newly thrown exception is set to the offset of the previously thrown exception.
In this case the xDelete, *   if any, is not invoked.
In this case there is no "blocking connection", so invoking * sqlite3_unlock_notify() results in the unlock-notify callback being * invoked immediately.
In this case there must be an adjacent deallocating / instruction.
In this case we need the statements to be executed, the regex is ignored, and the macro must accept a streamed message even though the message is never printed.
In this case we need to create a vtable stub for it.
In this case we'll have nulls after the first non-null entry here.
In this case we'll just explicitly forbid these operations since they may lead users to make false assumption by thinking they are inexpensive operations.
In this case,  *   because the index contains entries for both "first" and "1st", prefix *   queries such as 'fi*' or '1s*' will match correctly.
In this case, /     'value' is a pointer to the memory (and thus, its type is always an /     address) and the 'box' is nil.
In this case, Data contains /     a single chunk, with its unused high bits zeroed like in the /     out-of-line case.
In this case, Data must be 0.
In this case, captures can be / more efficient.
In this case, client could set options.change_level to true, to move the files back to the minimum level capable of holding the data set or a given level (specified by non-negative options.target_level).
In this case, fts5 assumes that the final value of *ppOut  *   is undefined.
In this case, only one object will be created and passed back to different threads.
In this case, the  *            In the above example, this means that the tokenizer returns the *            same token for inputs "first" and "1st".
In this case, the JmpZ/JmpNZ instruction can be converted to a PopC (no-op).
In this case, the ThreadLocal object is a true global, and the get() method returns a thread-dependent pointer from pthread's thread-specific data management.
In this case, the constraint / system is not applied to the expression AST, but the ConstraintSystem is / left in-tact.
In this case, the offset indicates the offset of sub_index_ holding the binary search indexes of keys for those rows.
In this case, the offset of the corresponding FCall* in the function that starts the region is returned.
In this case, the state doesn't need to be propagated to the fallthrough block.
In this case, the type is not quite as constrained / as a dynamic Self, because it is bound to the conforming type, / not the dynamic type of the value.
In this case, we have one ThreadLocal object per thread.
In this case, we start with a reference count to keep it alive.
In this case, you do not have to set -DHAVE_CONFIG_H.
In this case.
In this case: - keys() contains the list of internal keys seen in order of iteration.
In this mode non hh units will default to weak types and scalar types will be available outside the HH namespace.
In this mode, no threads or semaphores or timers are created, since they are not needed.
In this phase, identifiers are references / to the enclosing scopes, not a variable binding.
In this situation, we have to be careful not to have every thread simultaneously attempt to evict the extra entries, since we could end up underfilled.
In this state this node / is completely unlinked from the graph,
In this way, by maintaining a relatively sparse set of entries in a vector, we can use least upper bound searches on an offset key to find its corresponding T.
In those cases, since we cannot rely on SILCombines trivially dead instruction DCE in order to delete the instruction, visit methods should use this method to delete the given instruction and upon completion of their peephole return the value returned by this method.
In truth some of them may not be due to deficiencies in loop / info.
In unbuffered mode we always bypass read-ahead buffer at ReadaheadRandomAccessFile When read-ahead is required we then make use of compaction_readahead_size value and always try to read ahead.
In universal compaction, that is the sum of all input file sizes.
In vasm_emit(), we lower service request instructions (e.g., bindjmp) to their inline functionality (e.g., a smashable jump), and add a record in `stubs' so that we can emit the requisite stub and patch in its address after the rest of the unit is emitted.

It will reabstract / dependent types according to the abstraction level of their associated / type requirements.
It will remember the text in a stringstream.
It will return immediatelly, will not wait for the backup to stop.
It will return meaningful results only if clients call experimental feature SuggestCompactRange()
It will return records that were inserted into the database after the creation of the iterator.
It will return the wrong / result if there are multiple edges and will assert if there are no edges in / between the two blocks.
It will set the thread state according to the input parameter in its constructor and set the thread state to the previous state in its destructor.
It will stop all writes for the duration of the call.
It will take the function address from x16 (inter-procedural scratch reg).
It will then "consume" that value and stop looping.
It will use this proxy when completing control flow commands to interrupt the client.
It won't be Object or Resource, as these should never appear in an uncounted array.
It won't be freed until this number reaches 0.
It would be abstractly good to allow conversion to a base protocol to be trivial, but it's not clear that there's really a structural guarantee we can rely on here.
It would be nice if it could use the standard allocator interface.
It would be set to empty string if the thread does not involve in any DB operation.
It would probably be okay to add properties to the table concurrently.
It writes 1 to oflow_info if the integer is larger than LONG_MAX and -1 if it's smaller than LONG_MIN.
It writes 1 to oflow_info if the integer is larger than ZEND_LONG_MAX and -1 if it's smaller than ZEND_LONG_MIN.
It'd be nice if these were called lineStart and lineEnd or something, but we're not allowed to have nice things.
It's / much more likely that explicit closures will survive / optimization and therefore make it into e.g. stack traces.
It's O(universe), so if you need it it's probably better to use a bitset of some sort.
It's a NAN if the exponent bits are all ones and the fraction bits are not entirely zeros.
It's a no-op otherwise.
It's acceptable to make this a direct pointer because / parent types are relatively uncommon.
It's also used for the return type.
It's assumed that the / error parameter should be ignored if no error is present (unless / it needs to be checked explicitly to determine that).
It's declared as friend of WritableFile to allow forwarding calls to protected virtual methods.
It's defined in gtest-type-util.h.
It's deprecated
It's designed to be fast parsing and accessing.
It's either:
It's important that the IncRef happens after the guard on the inner type of the ref, since it may side-exit.
It's important to do this for / all the arguments, not just those that have default arguments.
It's inverse function is UnescapeOptionString().
It's legal in PHP to define multiple functions in different pseudomains with the same name, so long as both are not required in the same request.
It's necessary to specify a merge operator when openning the DB in this case.
It's normally preferable to use the version of this function that takes the opcode instead of this one.
It's not in interp-state.h because it's part of the internal implementation of interpreter routines.
It's not used anymore.
It's often useful to know where they were when debugging.
It's only reflected in the generated / SIL implicitly.
It's placed in the internal section, pending cleanup.
It's possible neither is true (e.g. if we're producing a TransKind::Live translation or we're producing a TransKind::Optimize translation and the link couldn't be attached for some reason.).
It's probably not worth optimizing for the case of switching operands on a single value.
It's recommended that you use the RCTInitRunnerForApp macro instead of calling this directly.
It's recommended to manually call CompactRange(NULL, NULL) before reading from the database, because otherwise the read can be very slow.
It's recommended to use check_recursion_throw() instead of this, as raising an error will use much more stack than throwing an exception, making this have a higher chance of blowing out what little stack the thread has left.
It's safe for Get() to terminate after having finished all the potential key for the k.user_key(), or not.
It's safe to call multiple times, so it is also called from the destructor (in case we bypassed the zombie state).
It's the caller's responsibility to make sure file is in the correct format.
It's the client's responsibility to satisfy this requirement.
It's type is / NodeType::Return.
It's universe_size() is not even guaranteed to be the same after it is moved from.
It's up the to arch-specific backends to emit some real work with no visible side-effects.
It's up to AnalysisResult objects to grab statements, functions and classes from FileScope objects to form execution paths.
It's used as the first element of  arg_info array to define properties of internal functions.
It's used as the first element of arg_info array to define properties of internal functions.
It's used by the unwinder to know that an ActRec has been partially torn down (locals freed).
It's used to verify that the stack is not modified between the beginning of a bytecode's translation and creation of any catch traces, unless exceptionStackBoundary() is explicitly called.

Iteration needs to be robust in the face of two challenges: (1) the case where an element is unset during iteration, and (2) the case where user code modifies the RefData to be a different array or a non-array value.
Iteration over blocks can be done directly if necessary but when you can, use a predefined Range, like LinearBlocks or RpoBlocks.

Iterators are heap allocated and need to be deleted before the db is deleted
Iterators cannot store Elm pointers (because it's possible for m_data to change without bumping m_version in some cases), so indices are used instead.
Iterators created with this handle will all observe a stable snapshot of the current DB state.
Iterators should be considered invalidated after any mutation.
Its / validity is guaranteed only at the instant the call begins.
Its easy to type-scan unique_ptr and more efficient to let it do it itself.
Its main purpose is for performing small combining operations/peepholes at the SIL level.
Its memory should be bump ptr allocated.
Its object instances are used to create std::istream objects interally.
Its parent begin frame is passed.
Its right child must be clear.

Its type is non-trivial, and the callee / is responsible for destroying it.
Its type is non-trivial, and the caller / guarantees its validity for the entirety of the call.
Its type may be trivial, or it may / simply be that the callee is not responsible for destroying it.

MSVC defines this macro iff RTTI is enabled.
MSVC detection (MSVC people usually don't use autoconf)
MSVC doesn't support the Itanium exception handling ABI, so we have some garbage stubs to convince MSVC to compile without freaking out.
MSVC prefers not changing the sign of the value when resolving the overloads, which means that an unsigned argument, even of a size smaller than int, will error so we provide an unsigned overload to fix that.
MSVC requires the definition for this static const to be in .CC file
MSVC requires the definition for this static const to be in .CC file The value of PI
MSVC version 1800 still does not have constexpr for ::max()
MSVC warns about adding const to a function type, so we want to disable the warning.
MSVC warns about implicitly converting from double to int for possible loss of data, so we need to temporarily disable the warning.
MSVC's Preprocessor is completely idiotic, so we have to play by its rules and forcefully expand the variadic args so they aren't all interpreted as the first argument to func.

Moreover the collection elements are accessed via an iterator.
Most 32-bit and 64-bit systems have 32-bit ints
Most HNI functions share a single builtinFuncPtr, which performs unpacking and dispatch.
Most SQL functions are * deterministic.
Most SQLite builds come with a * single default VFS that is appropriate for the host computer.
Most actions produce only a single output file, so we return 0 by default.
Most allocators (including the default one) ignores this value, and it is recommended to pass NULL as a dummy value for allocator_data.
Most are defined in interp.cpp, but some (like FCallBuiltin and member instructions) are defined elsewhere.
Most callers probably want the second overload, for simplicity.

Most instructions that change PC will break the tracelet, though some do not (e.g., FCall).
Most likely T is an enum type (either named or unnamed), in which case printing it as an integer is the desired behavior.
Most memory * allocators round up memory allocations at least to the next multiple * of 8.
Most methods require DB mutex held, unless otherwise noted
Most methods that operate on Pairs can safely assume that all Pairs have two elements that have been initialized.

Most queries to the Index need a "context", to allow recording dependencies.
Most recently closed capture
Most service requests are accomplished by jumping to a service request stub, which rolls up arguments and calls into the JIT via handleSRHelper().
Most status values come from ICU's ubrk.h.
Most strings are created this way.
Most strong iterator operations from arrays should be guarded on checking this first, and placed in an unlikely path.
Most symbolic flavors correspond with flavor descriptors in the HHBC spec, but some symbolic flavors used in the symbolic stack (ex.
Most system registers only implement a few of the bits in the word.
Most things won't have attributes, so we've made the map optimize for the case that it's empty (minimizing sizeof(UserAttributeMap)).
Most users don't need to concern themselves with any of this, as most of the complexity is hidden behind the allocator interface and standard container replacements.
Most value-parameterized classes can ignore the existence of WithParamInterface, and can just inherit from ::testing::TestWithParam.
Motivation: it is problematic to compute the CRC of a string that contains embedded CRCs.

Mutable array iteration usually iterates over m_ref---the m_data case here occurs is when we've converted an object to an array before iterating it (and this MArrayIter object actually owns a temporary array).
Mutable fields here are so that we can deserialize the object from disk while holding a const pointer to the StoreValue.
Mutable state in *impl_ is protected by mutex_.
Mutable to allow lazy computation of results
Mutable version of data().

NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE
NB: 24 bytes available here (in USE_LOWPTR builds).
NB: Do not use this unless the function is known to support cancellation and known to leave shared state in a consistent state (alternatively, the caller should proceed to shut down the process as well).
NB: HH files ignore this preference and always use strict checking, except in systemlib.
NB: Predicates that support negative Boolean assertions have reduced performance in positive ones so be careful not to use them in tests that have lots (tens of thousands) of positive Boolean assertions.
NB: The implementations on different platforms slightly differ.
NB: The only difference is that callarray preserves vmfp.
NB: This function is also used in Google Mock, so don't move it inside of the typed-test-only section below.
NB: We don't apply superclass substitutions to members because we want consistent metadata layout between generic superclasses and concrete subclasses.
NB: escapeString prepends and appends double quotes
NB: only works for single inheritance.
NB: will throw if the check fails.

NOTE NOTE NOTE ****** Starting from 1 (i.e. after OP_END), the values up to OP_EOD must correspond in order to the list of escapes immediately above.
NOTE that if dt is not KindOfObject, then we've already checked if the annotation was a direct reference to a "magic" interface that supports non-object types and we've already checked if the annotation was "self" / "parent", but the caller still needs to check if the annotation is a type alias or an enum.
NOTE that if the annotation is "array" and the value is a collection object, this function will return Fail but the runtime might possibly cast the collection to an array and allow normal execution to continue (see TypeConstraint::verifyFail() for details).
NOTE: Accessing this table is only permitted when synchronized with instance bits initialization.
NOTE: Boost actually checks if the last character of the first path element is a colon, rather than if the first character is an alpha followed by a colon.
NOTE: FbsonDocument only allows object container as the top level FBSON value.
NOTE: GenericParams ends with a tail-allocated array, so it cannot be followed by additional fields.
NOTE: In principle, entries may have LLVM_LIBRARY_VISIBILITY, because they are never called directly from the code produced by IRGen.
NOTE: Inlining will fail during translation if the FPush was interpreted.
NOTE: It is unfortunate that it essentially duplicates the code from sil-combine, but doing so allows for avoiding any cross-layer invocations between SIL and SILOptimizer layers.
NOTE: MixedArray no longer calls this constructor.
NOTE: MixedArray no longer calls this destructor.
NOTE: Our practice here is to set all the thread operation properties and stage before we set thread operation, and thread operation will be set in std::memory_order_release.
NOTE: Property names cannot end in numbers since those are interpreted as arguments, e.g., see kNumFilesAtLevelPrefix.
NOTE: RCTJSThread is not a real libdispatch queue
NOTE: Setting disable_auto_compactions to 'false' through SetOptions() API does NOT schedule a flush/compaction afterwards, and only changes the parameter itself within the column family option.
NOTE: SpatialDB is experimental and we might change its API without warning.
NOTE: The block can't expect any argument
NOTE: The values also appear in pcre_jit_compile.c.
NOTE: This only sets internal precision.
NOTE: This will only work as expected on MinGW.
NOTE: TypeExpr::getType() returns the type of the expr node, which is the metatype of what is stored as an operand type.
NOTE: We don't support files bigger than 2GB
NOTE: currently these event props are only declared so we can export the event names to JS - we don't call the blocks directly because scroll events need to be coalesced before sending, for performance reasons.
NOTE: do not change the values of existing entries, as these are part of the persistent format on disk.
NOTE: for the hash based lookup, if a key prefix doesn't match any key, the iterator will simply be set as "invalid", rather than returning the key that is just pass the target key.
NOTE: isFPush below relies on the grouping of FPush* here
NOTE: no need to fill this field, it's filled by VTune
NOTE: none of this is thread-safe
NOTE: should never acquire options_file_mutex_ and mutex_ at the same time.
NOTE: the filters in other levels are still useful even for key hit because they tell us whether to look in that level or go to the higher level.
NOTE: this can be extended to contain the callsites of the function.
NOTE: this is represented in the repo as a string type name and some TypeConstraint::Flags.

Note that / expressions like '(4)' are represented with a ParenExpr.
Note that / this node may be different than the refined range.
Note that ActRecs are also x64 frames, so this is an implicit machine dependency.
Note that NULL termination is needed even for a binary string, because String class only wraps such a "safe" one that can work with any functions that takes a C-string.
Note that PGO always has a coherent notion of TransID---the so-called `profTransID', which is just the region block ID (which are globally unique).
Note that a generic / witness will only be specialized if the conformance came from the current / file.
Note that adding a new element with the next available integer key may fail, in which case ret is set to point to the lval blackhole (see lvalBlackHole() for details).
Note that address-only / types are not legal to manipulate directly as objects in SIL.
Note that all scoping events via CreateCl opcodes clone from the "template" Closure subclass that is generated by the emitter, whereas scoping events via Closure::bind() clone from another scoped clone (which may or may not be the first clone, which aliases the template class).
Note that all thread-status features are still under-development, and thus APIs and class definitions might subject to change at this point.
Note that all types we see that could go into an object property have to loosen_statics and loosen_values.
Note that all-zero must / be a valid state for the cache.
Note that call-back functions should not run for an extended period of time before the function returns, otherwise RocksDB may be blocked.
Note that calling this method may throw if the failure callback throws an exception or raises a fatal error.
Note that calls that have been weakened to CallBuiltin use GeneralEffects, not CallEffects.
Note that changing the underlying TableFactory options while the TableFactory is currently used by any open DB is undefined behavior.
Note that currently this mem-table representation does not support snapshot (i.e., it only queries latest state) and iterators.
Note that each request handler may be invoked multiple times for different requests.
Note that entries sometimes need be to be constructed before they are entered, or need to be accessed after they are left.
Note that even if the string/array is already uncounted but not static, we still have to make a copy, as we have no idea about the lifetime of the other uncounted item here.
Note that even when "N" is changed, the specified number for "D" will not be changed.
Note that explicitly calling req::destroy_raw will run the destructors, but if you let the allocator sweep it the destructors will not be called.
Note that for a single integer below 62, we always use bitset mode, to make sure there is a single unique representation.
Note that for an FPush* may be set to the (statically known Func* that /this/ instruction is pushing)
Note that for memory usage inside Cache class, we will only report the usage of the input "cache_set" without including those Cache usage inside the input list "dbs" of DBs.
Note that function and class names are in separate namespaces, so it is possible to have a Func and Class which share a name but both of which are unique.
Note that gdImageColorTransparent is usually compatible with older browsers that do not understand full alpha channels well.
Note that generally speaking a RefData should never contain KindOfUninit, *except* uninitialized RefDatas for this RDS case.
Note that heap metadata are not necessarily type / metadata, even for objects of a heap type: for example, objects of / Objective-C type possess a form of heap metadata (an Objective-C / Class pointer), but this metadata lacks the type metadata header.
Note that here we prefer function static variable instead of the usual global static variable.
Note that if EvalJitEnableRenameFunction is set, no Func is unique.
Note that if applications would like to use the passed reference outside this function call, they should make copies from the returned value.
Note that if applications would like to use the passed reference outside this function call, they should make copies from these returned value.
Note that if cls and name are both too generic this object will have to give up all information it knows about any public static properties.
Note that if func was declared noexcept, then both gcc and clang are smart enough to elide the try/catch.
Note that if the filter encoding changes in an incompatible way, the name returned by this method must be changed.
Note that if the return is marked as accessible, then the property must exist.
Note that in PHP you can declare functions where some of the earlier parameters have default values, and later ones don't.
Note that in bytecode.specification, refs are abbreviated as "V".
Note that it could overrun the buffer by up to 7 bytes, depending on len and alignment of the buffers.
Note that it is possible for an iterator to point to the position before the first element (this is what the "reset" flag is for).
Note that it is up to the / caller to ensure that prior stages have already been handled.
Note that it's O(size()) worst case.
Note that it's not designed to be constant as in the future we might consider adding global count to the OperationInfo.
Note that its usually best to at least start by bisecting with name2 only, since (for some optimizations) skipping earlier optimizations can change later results.
Note that last might not be taken_block.
Note that m_status doesn't contain server health information.
Note that made_waitable is tracked separately from state transitions, because we can't atomically create the mutex and link into the list.
Note that modules are lazily instantiated, so calling these methods for the first time with a given module name/class may cause the class to be sychronously instantiated, potentially blocking both the calling thread and main thread for a short time.
Note that multiple / ambiguous solutions for the same constraint system are considered to be / success by this API.
Note that not all positions on the symbolic stack correspond to a value on the actual evaluation stack as described in the HHBC spec.
Note that nothing prevents using non-POD types with this.
Note that object types return raw pointers which generally should promptly get a wrap_local treatment.
Note that one transport object is created for each request, and one transport is ONLY accessed from one single thread.
Note that one transport object is created for each request.
Note that only Macintosh Internet Explorer and (possibly) Netscape 6 really support multiple levels of transparency in palettes, to my knowledge, as of 2/15/01.
Note that parsing for the body was delayed.
Note that pcre_study() has its own set of options.
Note that php5 xdebug doesn't actually raise an error on extra/invalid args.
Note that php5 xdebug doesn't distinguish internally between this and a conditional breakpoint (which is in the spec) The encoded condition is kept around for display purposes.
Note that previous value of `info` is reset, even upon failure.
Note that removing this object from the listener list with Release transfers its ownership to the caller and makes this function return NULL the next time.
Note that setting read_options.snapshot will affect what is read from the DB but will NOT change which keys are read from this transaction (the keys in this transaction do not yet belong to any snapshot and will be fetched regardless).
Note that size is per register, and is specified in bytes.
Note that some logical operations are not available to immediate-operand instructions, so we have to combine two masks here.
Note that stringstream behaves differently in gcc and in MSVC.
Note that struct-like arrays will be subtypes of map-like arrays with string keys.
Note that subclasses of File that need to be persisted must subclass FileData to add any persistent data members, e.g. see Socket.
Note that swift_allocateGenericClassMetadata will / never produce a metadata that requires relocation.
Note that system classes cannot be redeclared.
Note that tar can determine that the USTAR format is being used by the presence of the null-terminated string "ustar" in the magic field.
Note that the CGPathRef must be released by the caller.
Note that the Context is adjusted to account for the fact that Closure __invoke methods run in the context of a class other than their declaring class.
Note that the JIT accesses RDS RefDatas directly---if you need to change how initialization works it keep that up to date.
Note that the WitnessTables field is accessed via / spooky action from Header.
Note that the all the pointer options (except table_factory, which will be described in more details below) will be initialized with the default values.
Note that the behavior is different from CompactRange() in that CompactFiles() performs the compaction job using the CURRENT thread.
Note that the bit for __unset is further down due to Attr-sharing across types.
Note that the block size specified here corresponds to uncompressed data.
Note that the chain holds / every use of the current ValueBase, not just those of the / designated result.
Note that the code for processing them assumes that the values are less than 16.
Note that the code may have been emitted by other threads.
Note that the computed `e', and thus `mask', are *wrong* here, but they don't matter to the final result.
Note that the condition is optional.
Note that the condition test is -inverted- from the normal assert() semantics.
Note that the cost of load-time work also includes a binary-size penalty to store the loader metadata necessary to perform that work.
Note that the d'tor is not virtual in order to be efficient.
Note that the debug parser does not make any attempt to determine which object types are the same.
Note that the fridge parameter is incorrectly annotated.
Note that the generated function will still attempt to scan any bases normally.
Note that the given method produces an Objective-C method.
Note that the initialization / function itself does not need this attribute.
Note that the list may contain invalid entries for already / invalidated callers.
Note that the load counter does not count instruction fetches, only explicit loads.
Note that the memory for Y, U, V buffers is alloacted in one chunk, hence one should call free(*p_Y) only.
Note that the notion of "last BC offset" only makes sense for regions that are linear traces.
Note that the partial specialization for full applies inherits from this.
Note that the returned sizes measure file system space usage, so if the user data compresses by a factor of ten, the returned sizes will be one-tenth the size of the corresponding user data size.
Note that the semantics are that all keys are present at all times.
Note that the serialization of a Footer will always occupy at least kMinEncodedLength bytes.
Note that the size of this sparse map is based on the number of blocks when this LoopAnalysis structure was created.
Note that the state must be aligned to access 'long long' fields.
Note that the string must be changed accordingly when the associated function name changed.
Note that the structure * of the sqlite3_vfs object changes in the transaction between * SQLite version 3.5.9 and 3.6.0 and yet the iVersion field was not * modified.
Note that the this function must be implemented in a way such that it should not run for an extended period of time before the function returns.
Note that the underlying entry will be kept around until all existing handles to it have been released.
Note that the wrappers are parameterized on the static type of your (jobject) pointer, thus if you have a jobject that refers to a Java String you will need to cast it to jstring to get the jstring wrapper.
Note that there are cases where this function returns true but tvDecRefWillRelease() will return false.
Note that there are certain constructs that can appear in types which the scanner generator cannot handle automatically.
Note that there is a conflict between different definitions that / produce the same Objective-C method.
Note that these all compare equal (using the Is() method).
Note that these types imply the arrays are non-empty.
Note that this / excludes ObjC class metatypes, which may need to be wrapped or unwrapped / when converting from native representation to AnyObject representation.
Note that this ReadTier currently only supports Get and MultiGet and does not support iterators.
Note that this class is never destructed, so don't add complex members.
Note that this conformance entry was superseded by the given / entry.
Note that this does / *not* handle the metadata template stuff.
Note that this does not directly affect LastStackPointer().
Note that this does not distinguish designated /  vs.
Note that this doesn't help with tapping on a touchable element that is being scrolled, unless you can call cancelTouches exactly between "touches began" and "touches ended" events.
Note that this fix cannot rely on value_type being defined as many user-defined container types don't have value_type.
Note that this function always returns false for non-refcounted types.
Note that this function does not have access to the actual value, nor does it do any run time resolution on the annotation's class name.
Note that this function is not supported in RocksDBLite.
Note that this function must be implemented in a way such that it should not run for an extended period of time before the function returns.
Note that this function will return TBottom for TUninit.
Note that this includes lr.
Note that this includes private properties in both cases.
Note that this includes unique stubs like fcallHelperThunk, which are reached by PHP function call.
Note that this is *not* the function whose body the NI belongs to.
Note that this is NOT testing existence, but reading a boolean value.
Note that this is a many-to-one mapping, and that the identifier / passed in may only be the first portion of the attribute (e.g. in the case / of the 'unowned(unsafe)' attribute, the string passed in is 'unowned'.
Note that this is a memberwise initializer and thus the body will be / generated by SILGen.
Note that this is different than getting a boolean value.
Note that this is not equal to the number of outstanding weak pointers.
Note that this is only an estimate, because we will include fragmentation on the ends of slabs or due to alignment.
Note that this isn't really appropriate for compile-time constants that are actually representing user values (we want them to be visible to optimization passes, allocatable to registers, etc), just compile-time metadata.
Note that this may be an abstract class that did not provide an implementation.
Note that this may differ from m_funcVecLen, since numMethods() is the exact number of methods, and m_funcVecLen is only required to be an upper bound.
Note that this may differ significantly from the / type of l-value.
Note that this may include types that the property itself cannot actually contain, due to the effects of a possible __get function.
Note that this means that instructions which do nothing but store a php value to a location (without decreffing the old value that may have been there) cannot use GeneralEffects to represent that (they must use PureStore)---the same thing does not /quite/ apply to loads.
Note that this notification won't fire when debugging in Chrome.
Note that this number will be round up to the smallest multiple of 128 that is no less than the specified size.
Note that this offset is relative to the current instruction.
Note that this potential archetype was renamed (due to typo / correction), providing the new name.
Note that this type representation describes an invalid type.
Note that this value is only a hint, and not an indicator of the total memory used by the app.
Note that this will gather the methods the first time it is called and then memoize the results.
Note that this will init both the queue and the module itself if they have not already been created.
Note that this will init the instance if it has not already been created.
Note that this will init the module if it has not already been created.
Note that those types do exist, just with less ridiculous names: TGen and TPtrToGen, respectively.
Note that trapping SEH exceptions is not implemented here.
Note that unlike all of the preceding methods, this method is not abstract and therefore clients should not override it.
Note that we don't have setters.
Note that we don't put closure locals here because they are per-instance.
Note that we don't track the sizes of stubs anywhere---this code only works because all service requests emit a code segment of size svcreq::stub_size().
Note that we end up here if we pass a weak ref that refers to a collected object.
Note that we have added a member into the iterable declaration context, / so that it can also be added to the lookup table (if needed).
Note that we have added a member into the iterable declaration context.
Note that we have already type-checked the inheritance clause.
Note that we have attempted to
Note that we have to check again immediately after acquiring the lock to prevent a race.
Note that we have to update the LRU list before we increment m_size, so that other threads don't attempt to evict list items before they even exist.
Note that we intentionally don't std::forward 'args'.
Note that we intentionally use size_t for size class index here, so that gcc would not generate inefficient code.
Note that we look for both C::iterator and C::const_iterator.
Note that we make get and set access to ThreadStatusData lockless.
Note that we will have at most one active call to handleResume() in each VM nesting level, which is why this is just a single pointer.
Note that we've preserved vmStack.top(), and vmFirstAR was invalid prior to the popVMState above.
Note that when a function is invoked by the runtime via invokeFunc(), the "pre-live" state is skipped and the ActRec is materialized in the "live" state.
Note that when a static or uncounted string is in a TypedValue, it may or may not have KindOfPersistentString.
Note that write_buffer_size is enforced per column family.
Note the start of the field offset vector.
Note the string may not be null terminated.
Note these are different than those copying constructors that also take one value.
Note things that happened.
Note this functions returns a local reference, / which means that it must not be stored in a static variable.
Note this functions returns an alias_ref that / points to a leaked global reference.
Note this is a non-blocking call and it will return immediately.
Note this is a non-blocking call.
Note though that although it's not specified there, in addition to a fault entry offset, fault regions optionally list some information about iterators if the reason the fault region is there is to free iterator variables.
Note types used in executables
Note we cannot change the size_ of the current payload, as all values are packed.
Note, all these functions will create a new array than modifying input, although names of these functions sound like mutating.
Note, all these functions will create a new string than modifying input, although names of these functions sound like mutating.
Note, alloc is not considered /        to have side effects because its result/users represent /        its effect.
Note, despite the name, this can never return a non-Cell.
Note, read http://www.php.net/substr about meanings of negative start or length.
Note, the returned class may or may not be *defined* at the program point you care about (it could be non-hoistable, even though it's unique, for example).
Note, the returned function may or may not be defined at the program point (it could require a function autoload that might fail).
Note, this does not feel space with zeros in case the file is extended.
Note, this is disabled by default because of the need to have an intersection operation in the type system to maintain index invariants---it doesn't quite work yet.
Note, this is safe since result_ is a vector (guaranteed contiguous)
Note, we / do not require the function type attributes to match.
Note:  An InvalidArgument status will be returned if there are any Merge operators for this key.
Note:  Many of the methods in this class have comments indicating that external synchromization is required as these methods are not thread-safe.
Note:  You should not write or delete anything from the batch directly and should only use the functions in the Transaction class to write to this transaction.
Note: 'Array' is declared 'id' instead of 'NSArray' to avoid automatic bridging to 'Swift.Array' when this API is imported to Swift.
Note: 'Dictionary' is declared 'id' instead of 'NSDictionary' to avoid automatic bridging to 'Swift.Dictionary' when this API is imported to Swift.
Note: Because we are using the sign bit for testing pinnedness it is important to do a signed comparison below.
Note: Bottom is a type with no value, and Uninit/InitNull/Nullptr are considered types with a single unique value, so this function returns false for those types.
Note: Currently, this function will return Status::MergeInProgress if the most recent write to the queried key in this batch is a Merge.
Note: ErrorIterator with Status::Incomplete shall be returned if all the following conditions are met: 1.
Note: For boxed values, this will generate a LdRef instruction which takes the given exit trace in case the inner type doesn't match the tracked type for this local.
Note: For now, we are not `ini_get()` enabling these type of options as it is not trivial to come up with a non-hacky and workable way to store the data correctly.
Note: If changing this number, update native-func-caller.h using make_native-func-caller.php
Note: If you are using a TransactionDB, it is not recommended to implement FilterMergeOperand().
Note: If you want to see whether the set has exactly 0 or 1 element, use `empty()' or `hasSingleValue()' instead.
Note: Kinda unsigned overflow, but behaves differently on various cpus.
Note: NaN check is always performed.
Note: Not thread-safe.
Note: SLJIT_SDIV is single precision divide.
Note: SLJIT_UNUSED as destination is not valid for floating point operations, since they cannot be used for setting flags.
Note: The base field is aligned to PAGE_SIZE bytes (usually 4k or more).
Note: This flag cannot be combined with any other SLJIT_SET_* flag.
Note: To do prefix seek/scan in `UserCollectedProperties`, you can do something similar to:
Note: To emphasize that registers assigned to R2-R4 are saved registers, they are enclosed by square brackets.
Note: Variant is making unnecessary KindOfUninit checks here.
Note: We are relying on Clang nodes to be at least 4-byte aligned.
Note: We can't use llvm::TrailingObjects here because the trailing object type is opaque.
Note: You should always return a new instance for each call, rather than returning the same instance each time the bridge is reloaded.
Note: a key object must be followed by a value object.
Note: although sljit_emit_fast_return could be replaced by an ijump, it is not suggested, since many architectures do clever branch prediction on call / return instruction pairs.
Note: assuming bc::Nop is empty and has trivial dtor/ctor.
Note: auto is only a valid value for alignSelf.
Note: be careful when using this.
Note: blocks in fault funclets will have factored edges to the blocks listed as handlers in any ExnNode that contained the fault-protected region, since those control flow paths are possible.
Note: cobbled from the linux header file, with modifications
Note: could be 32-bit
Note: creating an FbsonDocument (through createDocument) does not allocate any memory.
Note: dst is the left and src is the right operand for SLJIT_CMPD.
Note: every call of sljit_emit_enter and sljit_set_context overwrites the previous context.
Note: expiration times are stored in 32-bits as seconds since the Epoch.
Note: flags are not changed (unlike sljit_emit_enter / sljit_emit_return).
Note: if SLJIT_R1 is -1 and SLJIT_R0 is integer min (0x800..00), the behaviour is undefined.
Note: if SLJIT_R1 is 0, the behaviour is undefined.
Note: if either operand is NaN, the behaviour is undefined for types up to SLJIT_S_LESS_EQUAL.
Note: if you are using a custom comparator that ignores some parts of the keys being compared, you must not use NewBloomFilterPolicy() and must provide your own FilterPolicy that also ignores the corresponding parts of the keys.
Note: if you have entry points on an array kind that should never be called, it's generaelly preferable to give them their own unique functions so it will be obvious which kind was involved in core files.
Note: in non-NDEBUG builds, tracks the context of each archetype / type, which can be very useful for debugging.
Note: it is an FORWARD iterator only due to the design of FBSON format.
Note: it is fine to continue to reuse one AliasAnalysis structure after mutating the IR, because the information it contains is both flow-insensitive and conservative.
Note: it returns with -1 for virtual registers (only on x86-32).
Note: it's unclear what's "vm" about this, and why it's not just resolve_include.
Note: iterators are forward direction only.
Note: keys will not be "de-duplicated".
Note: limit and max_limit contains the size for stack allocation.
Note: m_maybeRefReturn used to implement an optimization to avoid unbox checks when we call functions where we know no function with that name returns by reference.
Note: modifying Z_OBJPROP(z) with zend_hash_update() etc.
Note: non-const iteration is not allowed, since we don't want to allocate a map on accident.
Note: on x86-32, R3 - R6 (same as S3 - S6) are emulated (they are allocated on the stack).
Note: on x86-32, S3 - S6 (same as R3 - R6) are emulated (they are allocated on the stack).
Note: only for sljit specific, non ABI compilant calls.
Note: please do not add new code that assumes the range does include a null-terminator if possible.
Note: please do not introduce new uses of this API that write nulls 1 byte past slice.len---we want to weed those out.
Note: result is possibly larger than the real union when it has upper range.
Note: s_pageSize is a dynamically initialized static, so do not create global ReadOnlyArenas.
Note: see sljit_create_compiler for the explanation of allocator_data.
Note: since every set has a unique representation, this can be used for hashing.
Note: size() returns a signed int for historical reasons.
Note: sljit tries to emit the minimum number of instructions.
Note: sljit_emit_enter and sljit_set_context defines whether a register is S or R register.
Note: stack growing should not happen in small steps: 4k, 16k or even bigger growth is better.
Note: the current name of this module/function is historical.
Note: the function passed here escapes (naturally).
Note: the index is always an even number on ARM (except ARM-64), MIPS, and SPARC.
Note: the order of values is important.
Note: the returned function may or may not be defined at the program point (it could require a function autoload that might fail).
Note: the returned integer is *not* an rds::Handle.
Note: the sparse part of m_mem is deliberately uninitialized, but we do it for valgrind or asan builds.
Note: the top field is initialized to base.
Note: the what() method of this class is not thread-safe (t6900503).
Note: there is code that packs this enum in a 2-bit bitfield.
Note: these IDs are only valid for the duration of the process.
Note: this function returns true on array types without checking every element.
Note: this is potentially pessimistic for its use in ActRec state merging right now, but not incorrect.
Note: this may not work properly with LTO.
Note: this set is also may-information---and it is required to contain any location this instruction may do this to for correct analysis in refcount optimizations (it must be conservatively "too big" rather than too small).
Note: this structure may not be supported by all operating systems.
Note: we are only tracking control-flow insensitive types for object properties, because it can be pretty rough to try to track all cases that could re-enter the VM, run arbitrary code, and potentially change the type of a property.
Note: we deliberately don't call this PrintTo(), as that name conflicts with ::testing::internal::PrintTo in the body of the function.
Note: we don't have to do this for function which are recomputed.
Note: we might use more memory than memtable_memory_budget during high write rate period
Note: you're generally not going to want to copy-construct the return value of this function.
Note: zend_object_handlers will be an opaque (incomplete) type for callers external to EZC

On those systems, sqlite3_mutex_try() * will always return SQLITE_BUSY.
On windows, this method uses _wcsicmp which compares according to LC_CTYPE environment variable.
On x64, for example, the stack must be 16-byte aligned before calls, to allow the compiler to safely use aligned movs, e.g., for saving callee-saved XMM registers.

Once the key/index is found, we will stop search.
Once the request is sent and the onSendEndImpl() callback is triggered we are free to reset ourselves for another request.
Once the server calls onHeadersComplete() it guarantees that it will remain live until the transport calls onComplete() and that it will only access the transport via onBody() and onBodyComplete().
Once the session calls onBodyComplete() it will not make any further calls to the transport, though it will remain available to receive calls to onStdOut() and onComplete().
Once the transport calls onComplete() the session may destroy itself and the transport will no longer attempt to call any session callbacks.
Once the wait handle finishes, all blocked wait handles are notified.
Once there is a key larger than the static allocated buffer, another buffer is dynamically allocated, until a larger key buffer is requested.
Once this function is called, all associated resources are reclaimed and it is illegal to perform any further operation on this object.

Once we find that, regsFromActRec is called, which looks to see if the return ip for the frame before the VM frame has an entry in the fixup map (i.e. if it points into the translation cache)---if so, it finds the fixup information in one of two ways:  - Fixup: the normal case.
Once we finish processing a loop, we sort its subregions so that they / are guaranteed to be in RPO order.
Once we've linked the node into the skip list we don't actually need to know its height, because we can implicitly use the fact that we traversed into a node at level h to known that h is a valid level for that node.
Once write-ahead logs exceed this size, we will start forcing the flush of column families whose memtables are backed by the oldest live WAL file (i.e. the ones that are causing all the space amplification).

One of the following constants must be used as the last argument in virtual_file_ex() call.
One of these asserts if `objOrCls' is null, but it is a mystery which one.
One other note: having the interpreter visit blocks when they are unreachable still potentially merges types into object properties that aren't possible at runtime.
One past the end
One possibility if we really want to do this is to generate functions that access variables of interest in ThreadLocal* (all of them are NoCheck right now) and use the bytes of gcc's compiled functions to find the values we would need to pass to __emutls_get_address.

PCRE client programs can override this by selecting other values at run time.
PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.
PCRE is able to support several different kinds of newline (CR, LF, CRLF, "any" and "anycrlf" at present).
PCRE is compiled as an 8 bit library if it is not requested otherwise.
PCRE is written in Standard C, but there are a few non-standard things it can cope with, allowing it to run on SunOS4 and other "close to standard" systems.
PCRE keeps offsets in its compiled code as 2-byte quantities (always stored in big-endian order) by default.
PCRE must be compiled with the -DVPCOMPAT option on the command line.
PCRE uses recursive function calls to handle backtracking while matching.
PCRE uses some other 2-byte quantities that do not change when the size of offsets changes.

Parameter parsing API -- andrei
Parameter parsing in this class is done by making just one copy of the entire query (either URL or post data), then insert termintaing NULLs at end of tokens (name and value), url decode in-place and then store token's start char * addresses in ParamMaps.
ParameterizedTestCaseInfo accumulates tests obtained from TEST_P macro invocations for a particular test case and generators obtained from INSTANTIATE_TEST_CASE_P macro invocations for that test case.
ParameterizedTestCaseInfoBase accumulates test information provided by TEST_P macro invocations and generators provided by INSTANTIATE_TEST_CASE_P macro invocations and uses that information to register all resulting test instances in RegisterTests method.
ParameterizedTestCaseInfoBase is a generic interface to ParameterizedTestCaseInfo classes.
ParameterizedTestCaseRegistry contains a map of ParameterizedTestCaseInfoBase classes accessed by test case names.

Revision 1.8  93/02/19  15:01:26  ian Numerous changes from Guy Harris too numerous to mention but including byte-order independance, fixing "old-style masking", etc.
Rewire those regions to consider the loop to be their / successor instead and make each of those regions on of the predecessors of / the subloop.
Rewrite the type of this r-value.
Rhe meaning of the instruction will depends on processor mode or execution mode
Right now most of the interfaces concentrate on type information, but more can be added as needed.
Right now this is a source location, plus information about the live types that we need to be compiling for.
Right now uninits may find their way into here though.
Right now we don't import function types.
Right now we have a static maximum number of tracked locations---passes using information from this module must be conservative about locations that aren't assigned an id.
Right now, all components cost the same: they take one load.
Right now, all object pointers are brought down to the least common denominator for extra inhabitants, so that we don't have to worry about e.g. type substitution on an enum type fundamentally changing the layout.
Right now, the primary example of that sort of AliasClasses is the class of locations in `kills' sets in certain memory effects structs: these sets indicate every location inside the class is affected.
Right now, this function will work for specific AliasClasses we've assigned ids---for larger classes, it only supports stack ranges observed during alias collection, AFrameAny, and some cases of unions of those---if you need more to work, the implementation will need some improvements.

Safe for concurrent use by multiple threads.
Safe memory allocation.

See sljitConfig.h Disadvantages: - No automatic register allocation, and temporary results are not stored on the stack.
See sljit_emit_enter for more details - Supports self modifying code: target of (conditional) jump and call instructions and some constant values can be dynamically modified during runtime - although it is not suggested to do it frequently - can be used for inline caching: save an important value once in the instruction stream - since this feature limits the optimization possibilities, a special flag must be passed at compile time when these instructions are emitted - A fixed stack space can be allocated for local variables - The compiler is thread-safe - The compiler is highly configurable through preprocessor macros.

Simulation helpers.
Simultaneously clear the pinned flag and decrement the reference count.
Simultaneously gets the result of 'm_break', and clears it.
Simultaneously query whether this string is numeric, and pull out the numeric value of the string (as either an int or a double).
Since MakeAndRegisterTestInfo receives ownership of test factory pointer, same factory object cannot be passed into that method twice.
Since RegularLocations represent the majority / of locations, this greatly simplifies the user code.
Since Secret is a secret and incomplete type, the only expression a user can write that has type Secret* is a null pointer literal.
Since all CanType's can be used / as 'Type' (they just don't have sugar) we derive from Type.
Since class methods cannot be defined with C-linkage we need to define a free C-function to pass into pthread_create().
Since core members of the Google Test project don't have access to other platforms, support for them may be less stable.
Since file numbers grow monotonically, this also means that pending_outputs_ is always sorted.
Since fpOff is given as an offset from the frame pointer as if it were in the normal place on the main stack, we have to reconstruct that "normal place".
Since it fills "*desc" with the up-to-date information, this call might internally lock and release DB mutex to access the up-to-date CF options.
Since it is an analysis it does not modify the IR in anyway.
Since it is more specific than the generic ones in ::testing::internal, it will be picked by the compiler in the following statement - exactly what we want.
Since it is slow it should be only used in error messages.
Since it is unconstrained, it has predicates to test whether `rn' is a GPR, XMM, or virtual register.
Since it's going into an ordered map...
Since making a service request leaves the TC, we need to sync the current `spOff' to vmsp.
Since metadata is (currently) / never released, it does not support deallocation.
Since priorities are only meaningful due to how they relate to each other, it's important to consider existing overrides when overriding this (add your handler here if you do):  10: ZendObjectStore (in runtime/ext_zend_compat/hhvm/zend-object-store.h)
Since rTmp cannot be a destination, it cannot be in a copy-cycle, so its value will be read before we deal with cycles.
Since some compilers define these standard functions as macros, the wrapper cannot have the same name as the wrapped function.
Since std::runtime_error inherits from std::exception, many testing frameworks know how to extract and print the message inside it.
Since the address space is reserved, the data never copied to other regions, thus it is safe to store pointers here.
Since the hash value of each key is requested multiple times, you should use a key with a memoized hash function.
Since the initializer is ASTContext-allocated it is safe.
Since the inner declaration inherits the context / archetypes of the outer function we do not need to open them here.
Since the job was not created by this queue class, it's up to a worker class on whether to deallocate the job object correctly.
Since the lock is being released the owner_ field should no longer be considered valid.
Since the return value is a raw pointer, the TableFactory owns the pointer and the caller should not delete the pointer.
Since these structures are freed by sljit_free_compiler, the addresses must be preserved by the user program elsewere.
Since this gives you a raw pointer, it is your responsibility to manage the ref-count yourself.
Since this intended to be called when user input is received, it is not performance critical.
Since this is * handled as a fatal error by SQLite, vfs implementations should endeavor * to prevent this by setting mxPathname to a sufficiently large value.
Since this is / evaluated at parse time, this is always known.
Since this is a template, it will only instantiate cases that are used and thus we still require full coverage of the AST nodes by the visitor.
Since this is often used as a static global, we want to do anything that might try to access ThreadInfo::s_threadInfo here instead of in the constructor.
Since void doesn't actually store anything, we can save some memory by using a single static instance of the void type.
Since we account for these direct allocations in our usage and adjust for them on allocation, we also need to adjust for them negatively on free.
Since we don't ever use the two at the same time, it is okay to use a union.
Since we don't use any of the pointer types, the compiler cannot use type aliasing assumptions to miscompile.
Since we iterate in insertion order, it might be convenient to ask what's at the front or the back.
Since we know that our array is sorted and uniqued, Ptr must be that element.
Since we know that our sorted arrays are uniqued, we can use set_union to get the uniqued sorted array that we want.
Since we use a serial file queue `RKFileQueue`, reading/writing from multiple threads should be perceived as being atomic, unless someone bypasses the `RCTAsyncLocalStorage` API.
Since we want the debug info to survive, we do not remap the location here.
Since we're rolling our own anyway, fix ffs's wacky offset-by-one historical implementation.
Since we're the only thread allowed to write, we're allowed to do a relaxed load here.

So * the new function is not good for anything by itself.
So / we can only reap the cleanup stack up to the innermost depth / that we've handed out as a Scope.
So I try an explanation: if one experimentally tests all multipliers between 1 and 256 (as RSE did now) one detects that even numbers are not useable at all.
So PHP would crash by allowing the call.
So a disable must be attached to a stack depth.
So a function that sets up a stack frame at all uses as least FIXED_FRAME bytes of stack.
So also unclear where it was *introduced*.
So callers should make a copy when needed.
So compare words.
So far, only certain string properties take an argument.
So if S1 and S2 are the same set, their pointers must also be the same set.
So if that is a possibility for your workload, ConcurrentScalableCache is recommended instead.
So if this method returns false, it is because client specified bad data or there was internal corruption.
So if we don't need to return one, we can just stop here.
So if we have a parent, we cannot be root.
So in the case that the helper throws an exception, the unwinder will believe it has to decref three normal stack slots (where the pre-live ActRec is).
So it depends on register pressure of the call site.
So keys().back() was the first key seen by iterator.
So on 32-bit systems we use absolute addresses for jump targets and constants, but on 64-bit systems realtive 32-bit offsets
So please use this version only if you are sure the call is safe.
So return true.
So that BaseMap can call intLikeStrKeys on a HashCollection
So that tests can avoid clobbering the config file
So the following line has been commented-out to accommodate.
So the longest string that can be completely * written will be n-1 characters.
So the redefinition macros are only valid if the * SQLITE_CORE macros is undefined.
So the transaction log (if enabled) will still contain (key, delta_value).
So they will not work if admin server is not present, or if the new server and old server disagree on port and password for admin server.
So this is nonzero if and only if there any bits set other than an arbitrarily long sequence of low bits.
So this macro should be used to mark at least one function that is referenced, and other functions that are not referenced in the same file.
So trigger an assert in debug builds, and cap it in opt builds.
So unless you want to provide own a different output stream type, use FbsonJsonParser object.
So unless you want to provide own a different output stream type, use FbsonParser object.
So we distinguish between functions and variables.
So we don't change existing definitions of PCRE_EXP_DECL and PCRECPP_EXP_DECL.
So we encode each as a 16-bit difference.
So we have a type, name, and possibly associated local for the base's container.
So we know when we can delete the value      .
So we place it in the global systemlib and bind its dependencies early.
So we return a conservative false in this case.
So we use __thread on gcc, icc and clang, unless we are on OSX.
So we wait until onParse is called for the class, and it calls onParseRecur for its children.
So we will just evict one extra element per insert() until the overfill is rectified.
So, for example, a base with BaseLoc::Frame could be located inside of a Ref that is pointed to by the Frame.
So, for now, we go with "import".
So, instead of storing pointers we / map pointers to indices and store the indices.
So, it needs to be possible for different types of linked_ptr to participate in the same circular linked list, so we need a single class type here.
So, mongo_cursor_free_le, when given a MONGO_LINK, will kill all cursors associated with that link.
So, we're going to keep a separate list of link ids associated with cursor ids.

Some of the builtin comparators in PHP do not impose a strict weak ordereding (ex.
Some of the implementations also interact with the VM to setup further notifications, though this is not the only place the debugger interacts directly with the VM.

Thankfully, you can't mix the two, so we can have some assertions around this.
Thanks to Koenig look-up, if T is a class and has its own PrintTo() function defined in its namespace, that function will be visible here.
Thanks to ParamCoerceMode, this will either be a nullable or falsable version of the declared return type.
That binding can be done in a dynamic shared object.
That can happen in a variety of fashions, so we have to consult AtEnd().
That capability * is no longer provided.
That frame size will be determined somewhat efficiently since it will have already been computed by the off-main-thread layout system.
That is by design, use the following with methods instead of mutating these objects.
That is, AliasClasses that should be interpreted as referring to every point they contain.
That is, PCRE can support *either* EBCDIC code *or* ASCII/UTF-8/16/32, but not both at once.
That is, an array with either a constant value or some (maybe partially) known shape.
That is, given / that this l-value trafficks in values following the original / abstraction pattern, make an l-value trafficking in values / following the substituted abstraction pattern.
That is, given / that this l-value trafficks in values following the substituted / abstraction pattern, make an l-value trafficking in values / following the original abstraction pattern.

That is, php arrays with static string keys and values of mixed types.
That is, php arrays with zero-based contiguous integer keys, and values of mixed types.
That is, we can never remove breakpoints from the global filter because there could be overlap.
That is: an instruction may not read a local that isn't mentioned in this set.
That is: if you change the IR to reference new abstract memory locations, the fact that AliasAnalysis didn't know about it won't invalidate the things it knows about (and the general may_alias function will still work on the new location).
That job is delegated to its c_-prefixed child classes.
That means that there can't be an exact match.
That means that you can for example call the toString() method using the jclass wrapper, or any other class that inherits from the jobject wrapper.
That means they will die after main() has returned.
That must be handled specially in bytecode.cpp.
That really sounds like a workaround of buggy coding.
That subclass is responsible for allocating/freeing its own internal data.
That template parameter would deduce to 'long', making this a better match than the first overload even without the first overload's EnableIf.
That way RocksDB's compaction is doing sequential instead of random reads.
That way we keep track of number of compaction and flush threads we need to schedule.
That way, client can still access data from dropped column family.
That way, we can easily change our format while providing backwards compatibility.
That way, when we advance any generator, we just need to look up a leaf node (which all have a reference to a root node).
That's more than enough for our purposes currently.
That's the basic use case.
That's why we're using manually values from BucketMapper
That's why, in the non-Windows case, we set PCRE_EXP_DEFN and PCRE_EXP_DATA_DEFN only if they are not already set.

The / result will be an address type if the base type is an address / type or a class.
The / scope's end location points to the SourceLoc that shows when the operation / is performed at runtime.

The / text is inserted immediately *after* the token specified.
The / type of that object uniquely determines the type of an l-value / for it.
The / value is accessed directly through the returned address.
The 3rd and 4th parameters to the authorization * callback function will be parameters or NULL depending on which of these * codes is used as the second parameter.
The 4th and 5th arguments are the byte offsets *   of the first byte of and first byte immediately following the text from *   which the token is derived within the input.
The ABI version of the Swift data generated by this file.
The ABI will be broken and the methods structure will be somewhere else in the memory which can crash external code.
The API for priming APC.
The API is not thread-safe.
The API is stolen with pride from unique_ptr and the semantics should be basically the same.
The AST already / contains extensions loaded from any generation up to and including this / one.
The AST node that introduced this context.
The AST node this lexical scope represents.
The ActRec is located stackOff slots above the stack at the start of the context, contains the supplied func, and the m_this/m_class field is of type objOrClass.
The AliasAnalysis cache can't directly map a pair of ValueBase pointers / to alias results because we'd like to be able to remove deleted pointers / without having to scan the whole map.
The AnyObject protocol.
The Arena typedef is for convenience when you want a default configuration.
The ArrayData's element area can be computed from m_arr via the packedData() helper function.

The BottomUpIPAnalysis::CurrentUpdateID.
The CIE's data_alignment_factor.
The CPU time is attributed to the caller of the entered function.
The CPU time is attributed to the exited function.
The CPU time is attributed to the resumed async function, because the CPU time was spent by the scheduler on the behalf of the resumed function (preparing for reentry, unserializing result of external thread event, etc.).
The Class doesn't need to be resolved, because private properties don't depend on the inheritance hierarchy.
The Class is completely dead at this point, and its memory is freed immediately.
The Class scope the closure was defined in.
The Class that provided this method implementation.

The DWARF specification allows the compiler / to use the special line number 0 to indicate code that cannot be / attributed to any source location.
The DWARF version emitted by the Swift compiler.
The DWARF version of debug info.
The Debugger generally manages proxies, sandboxes, and is the inital handler of interrupts from the VM.
The Decl holds the DeclContext, location, but also allows to / look up struct members.
The DestType describes the return type of native helper calls, particularly register assignments.
The DiagnosticEngine to which this Compilation should emit diagnostics.
The Dump method generates code to store a snapshot of the register values.
The Error type is always canonical.
The ErrorProtocol protocol.
The ErrorProtocol witness table.
The EscapeAnalysis provides information if the lifetime of an object exceeds / the scope of a function.
The FPI Region protects the range of instructions that execute with the partial activation on the stack, which is the instruction after FPush* up to and including FCall*.
The FPI stack is used for inlining---when we start inlining at an FCall, we look in here to find a definition of the StkPtr,offset that can be used after the inlined callee "returns".
The FR and FS register sets are overlap in the same way as R and S register sets.
The FastCGI protocol transmits HTTP headers as key-value pairs in a stream using the FCGI_PARAMS record.
The FileData is stored in a shared_ptr and managed by new/delete, so it is safe to store in an object whose lifetime is longer than a request.
The FinalRelease set is placed in the out parameter / FinalRelease.
The Fixup map allows us to reconstruct the state of the VM registers (fp, sp, and pc) from an up-stack invocation record.
The Fixup record just stores an offset relative to the ActRec* for vmsp, and an offset from the start of the func for pc.
The Func and Unit for this frame.
The Func class cannot be safely extended, because variable amounts of memory associated with the Func are allocated before and after the actual object.
The Func in the topmost AR on the stack.
The Func* can be retrieved by using this ID as an index into a global vector.
The Func* may be nullptr.
The GC uses these pointers to further populate the worklist.

The IN_UCHARS macro multiply its argument with the byte size of the current pcre_uchar type.
The IPC protocol version.
The IPv6 literal can be a IPv4 mapped address (like ::ffff:127.0.0.1).
The IRInstruction is stack allocated, and should not escape the lambda, so we fill it with 0xc0 in debug builds after we're done.
The IRInstruction* must not escape `func'---the aforementioned gen() methods use IRUnit::clone() to duplicate the instruction in arena memory.
The ISA is opaque so masking it will not return a pointer.
The Id is assigned by a global StaticMeta singleton.
The Immed64 wrapper picks up whether the immediate argument was an integer or a pointer type, so we don't have to cast pointers at callsites.
The Indent struct and ITRACE are used for tracing with nested indentation.

The real test command
The reason / that we do this is to ensure that each BBs ID is the RPO number of the BB / at the function level.
The reason for the shared object and loading at start-up is due to build system limitations.
The reason for this overload is that streaming a NULL pointer to ostream is undefined behavior.
The reason for using a constant is to make supporting PIC easier (although we only support PIC on ppc64le which has a minimum 32 bytes of stack frame, and currently always use that much, PIC on ppc64 would need to use 48).
The reason it must still count its parameter locals is that the caller may or may not pass any of the parameters, regardless of how many are declared.
The reason ranges extend downward is that it is common to need to refer to the class of all stack locations below some depth (this can be done by putting INT32_MAX in the size).
The reason that this is a function that returns "this" instead of a constructor is to enable chaining of multiple similar calls in the future.
The reason this exists is because certain functions on the index may cause it to need to consult information in the bodies of functions other than the Context passed in.
The reason this is necessary is to make it / easier to handle exits through / / 3.
The reason to add this method is to wrap that dichotomy to reduce / errors.
The reason to make this expectation clear is for the use of this module by refcount optimizations.
The reason why I have this separate / from BottomUpRefCountState is I think it gives more clarity to the / algorithm by giving it typed form.
The reason why I have this separate / from TopDownSubstruct is I think it gives more clarity to the algorithm by / giving it typed form.
The reason why it's a bit field is because of filtering during read preference scanning (see read_preference.c).
The reason why this is important is to be able to handle exits to / trapping code.
The reason why this is necessary is that subregions / of a loop, may have a non-local successor edge pointed at this region's / successor edge.
The reason why we do this is to make sure we / have access to the original argument's state if we modify the argument / when optimizing.
The reason why we use an Index instead of a / pointer is that the SmallVector that we use to store these can reallocate / invalidating our pointers.

This / Class.

This / data is tail allocated so that the basic block case is not penalized by / storing this unnecessary information.

This / is just for debugging purposes --- e.g. the destructor asserts / that it's true --- but is otherwise derivable from / RemainingArgsForCallee, at least between calls.
This / is produced when parsing types and when name binding type aliases, and is / installed in declaration that use these erroneous types.
This / is used as a type metadata pointer when the actual class isn't / Swift-compiled.
This / location may be invalid, if the diagnostic is not directly related to / the source (e.g., if it comes from command-line parsing).
This / makes 18 operations, except that some of these operations are / fairly unlikely and so do not merit optimized entries, due to / the common code patterns of the two use cases: /   - Existential code usually doesn't work directly with T*s /     because pointers into existential objects are not generally /     reliable.
This / means that any unidentified pointer in the function may alias to / the node's value.
This / means that even masking the ISA may not return a pointer value.
This / only destructures a single level of tuple.
This / pointer is completely unmanaged and is equivalent to i8* in LLVM IR.
This / returns the new instruction if it inserts one, otherwise it returns null.

This allows initialization to work whether pthread_t is a scalar or struct.
This allows invoking object method calls directly, but ONLY for specialized subclasses of ObjectData.

This is important for HHVM for several reasons.
This is in the can-potentially-change-program-behavior section because if you unserialize specially-constructed strings you could create instances with private properties that don't follow the inferred types.

This is necessary in order to accommodate non-scalar defaults (e.g., class constants), which not be consistent across requests.
This is necessary since we represent a loop in the / Subregions array by the RPO number of its header.
This is necessary since when one ThreadLocalPtr gets destroyed, we need to loop over each thread's version of pointer corresponding to that instance and call UnrefHandler for it.
This is necessary to ensure forward progress in certain situations, such as hitting the translation limit for a SrcKey.
This is necessary when pushing or otherwise adding things to the stack, to satisfy the AAPCS64 constraint that the memory below the system stack pointer is not accessed.

This is not an opcode, but is used to check that tables indexed by opcode are the correct length, in order to catch updating errors - there have been some in the past.
This is not an optimal solution This value is in principle a constexp, but the integer-to-pointer cast would require a reinterpret cast, which is not allowed in a constexpr
This is not an option ID.
This is not considered a compatibility * break because any application that ever receives an SQLITE_MISUSE error * is broken by definition.

This is not set for multi-level tuple arguments.
This is not type metadata, but is referenced by / existential type metadata records to describe a protocol constraint.
This is not used by PCRE, but by defining it we make it easier to slot PCRE into existing programs that make POSIX calls.

This is not valid for a SubscriptDecl.
This is null for the root class.
This is null if there is no type / associated with this element, as in 'case Z' or in all elements of enum / definitions.

This is primarily used by the JIT to burn the initializer into the TC.
This is probably a bad idea and is not intended to be permanent.
This is produced when / parsing expressions and producing diagnostics.
This is provided in this format because the region selector wants to terminate profiling translations at block ends (so it doesn't care where blocks start, just where they end).
This is provided so that the callee can set the caller's zval* to point to a different zval.
This is quite specific to definitive analysis in that it is tuple element sensitive instead of relying on SROA.

This is safe because the LHS owns the only reference.
This is safe because unordered_map only invalidates pointers that have been erased.
This is safe because we don't add any members, nor change any functionality.
This is separate from / whether or not entries is empty since you can have an empty witness table / that is not a declaration.
This is separate from act-rec-inl.h in order to keep the transitive header dependencies of act-rec.h as tight as possible.
This is separate from an actual Class because in different requests (depending on include order), the actual instantiation of a PreClass may differ since names may have different meanings.
This is set by sema during type checking.
This is set right before the rootViewDidChangeIntrinsicSize method of RCTRootViewDelegate is called.
This is similar to erase, but instead of removing the element from the / vector, it just zeros out the key in the vector.
This is similar to half-precision floating point, but no sign bit, no exponent bias, and no implicit 1 added to the fraction.
This is slightly slower, but gives us the benefit of extra assertions.
This is smaller than MAX_INT, and we want a CapCode to precisely encode it.
This is so that any array can check that there are no active MArrayIters just by comparing the first slot of this table with null.
This is something we're fixing.
This is spelled "_".
This is still experimental.
This is stored as a pointer to the arguments buffer, so that we can save an offset while looking for the matching argument given a key.

This works in both modes non-EBCDIC platforms, and on EBCDIC platforms in UTF-8 mode only.
This works well for "indirectable" references because most objects are known to be well-aligned, and the cases that aren't (chiefly functions and strings) rarely need the flexibility of this kind of reference.
This would allow its member-thread to know its priority.
This would be used in cases where the application knows that there are very few misses or the performance in the case of misses is not important.
This would leave 4 byte padding hole, though, which some users (e.g. IndexedStringMap) might have a use for, so we expose it as a slot for our users.
This would make it impossible to use characters in switch/case statements, which would reduce performance.
This would require some serious programmer error.
This would typically be triggered by a scroll event

Those binary search indexes are organized in this way:
Those entries are removed lazily in / removeInvalidCallers().
Those key-value pairs will then be inserted into the mock table.
Those macros must compile on such systems iff EXPECT_DEATH and ASSERT_DEATH compile with the same parameters on systems that support death tests.
Those members may in turn have customized serialization behavior, or they may "bottom out" to these helpers if they are basic-enough types.
Those methods are slightly cheaper.
Those offsets need to be guaranteed to be in ascending order so the keys they are pointing to are also in ascending order to make sure we can use them to do binary searches.
Those return YES.
Those that are compatible with JIT execution are flagged with J.
Those that follow are added in version 2 or later
Those that take "arr" or "var" are copy constructors, taking array value from the parameter, and they are NOT constructing an array with that single value (then one should use Array::Create() functions).
Though if some other library needs some stuff from stdint.h included afterwards and misses it, we'd have to extend ours.
Though it has CR and LF characters, a common practice has been to use its NL (0x15) character as the line terminator in C-like processing environments.
Though they are intended for internal * use by SQLite, code that links against SQLite is * permitted to use any of these routines.
Thread Safety: Unlike other linked_ptr implementations, in this implementation a linked_ptr object is thread-safe in the sense that: - it's safe to copy linked_ptr objects concurrently, - it's safe to copy *from* a linked_ptr and read its underlying raw pointer (e.g. via get()) concurrently, and - it's safe to write to two linked_ptrs that point to the same shared object concurrently.

Ways in which an object can be referenced.
Ways in which an object can fit into a fixed-size buffer.
We / do not support loops with multiple loop latches and instead rely on loops / to be canonicalized to have one back edge.
We WILL change the `char *' entries, so make sure that you allocate a separate buffer for them and that you free them after sapi_deactivate().
We achieve this by overwriting the ActRec cells with nulls.
We add a new format of filter block called full filter block This new interface gives you more space of customization
We allocate a unique 32-bit ID to almost all Funcs.
We allow a non-default basically for an minstr use case.
We allow the buffer to grow until it's size hits the limit.
We allow the buffer to grow until the specified value and then for bigger requests allocate one shot buffers.
We already know that 'expected' is a null pointer.
We already subst so getOpConformance is not needed.
We also clone methods from traits when we transclude the trait in its user Classes in repo mode.
We also count the number of unique elements for allocation purposes.
We also define the EXPECT_* variations.
We also must clear the low bit so that we can memcpy this one element into the newly allocated block of memory.
We also need to track effects of intermediate dims on the type of the base.
We also pack bits into the key---the low bit is set if the function is a magic call (in which case the cached Func* is, and the second lowest bit is set if the cached Func has AttrStatic.
We also provide some convenient wrappers:
We also share these layouts from the decls block.
We always use the pointer's width as its swift ABI alignment.
We are asserting to make sure that is the case
We are going to mangle a method declared in this context / (which must be a type context) and do not need its generic / parameters, or the parameters from its enclosing types, to be / bound because we will bind them as part of processing the / method's formal signature.
We are not going to structure directories this way at all, but we will have PlainFile, ZipFile and Socket derive from this base class, so they can share some minimal functionalities.
We are not handling overloaded classes right now
We are on Windows CE, which has no environment variables.
We are only supporting UTF-8 and ISO-8859-1 encoding.
We are visiting the node's left subtree.
We assert this.
We assume L* and R* don't alias, so we don't need to check type tags when comparing.
We assume that / Start and End are both in the same basic block.
We assume that I is an instruction in the block.
We assume that S2 is sorted and uniqued.
We assume that Start and End / are both in the same basic block.
We assume that Start and End are both in the / same basic block.
We assume that the Clang type might provide additional structure.
We assume that these are accurate.
We assume that we will only this in one place so no reference counting is necessary.
We avoid expanding the lower level file set of a compaction if it would make the total compaction cover more than (expanded_compaction_factor * targetFileSizeLevel()) many bytes.
We avoid picking too many files in the source level so that we do not exceed the total source bytes for compaction to exceed (source_compaction_factor * targetFileSizeLevel()) many bytes.
We break profiling blocks after any instruction that can side exit, including instructions with predicted output, and before any control flow merge point.
We cache the last search to accelerate code that / searches the same value in a loop.
We call dump() on the object instead of using dumpNode here so that the former will be available in a debug build as long as something in the program calls dump on the collection.
We can access the isa of pure Swift heap objects directly.
We can assume that the pinned flag isn't set unless the refcount is nonzero, and or'ing it in gives us a more efficient mask: the check just becomes "is newval nonzero".
We can burn these into the TC even when classes are not persistent, since only a single name-to-class mapping will exist per request.
We can burn these into the TC even when functions are not persistent, since only a single name-to-function mapping will exist per request.
We can construct the set directly from 0 or 1 integer, or a range of integers.
We can convert later to remove them
We can create an AStack from either a stack pointer or a frame pointer.
We can do this as we are playing the role of a standard library vendor.
We can fall out here if the value wasn't actually a valid MetadataKind.
We can flip the typedef if/when the LLVM interface supports LLVM containers.
We can get called early in boot, so allow null mcg.
We can give these reasonable default implementations.
We can give this a reasonable default implementation.
We can restore the information - the use - by looking at the / new branch and the operand index.
We can statically determine the presence of extra inhabitants for fixed / types.
We can toggle these values, but they need sum to 128 so that RegSet can fit into two registers.
We can use intersection for this because the lattice is multiplicative with respect to concretization--that is, the concretization of Range1 meet Range2 is equal to the intersection of the concretization of Range1 and the concretization of Range2.
We can't (easily) remove items from m_expQueue, so if we add a new entry every time an item is updated we could end up with a lot of copies of the same key in the queue.
We can't avoid the refcounting when it's a ref.
We can't batch gradient painting in CoreGraphics, so those will return NO and paint gets called instead.
We can't be universally fixed size if we're not locally fixed size.
We can't copy them around.
We can't have SSATmps spanning php-level calls, except for frame pointers and constant values.
We can't just / forward-declare their PointerLikeTypeTraits because we don't own / the types.
We can't just disable the breakpoint until we leave the site because some opcode in the site could recurse to the site.
We can't just eagerly scan the pointer as a T here because it might be actually be pointing to something derived from T.
We can't officially use ESC_t because it is a POSIX reserved identifier (presumably because of all the others like size_t).
We can't put an ifdef inside the typedef because pcretest needs access to the struct of the 8-, 16- and 32-bit variants.
We can't scan the whole cache and remove all of the occurrences of the pointer.
We cannot call PrintTo(*it, os) here as PrintTo() doesn't handle *it being a native array.
We cannot determine these outside the compilation (e.g. by running a program as part of "configure") because PCRE is often cross-compiled for use on other systems.
We cannot inline/clone debug intrinsics without a scope.
We cannot name this class MutexLock because the ctor declaration would conflict with a macro named MutexLock, which is defined on some platforms.
We cannot optimize the argument.
We cannot simply use From(), as the type From may not have a public default constructor.
We cannot use UniversalPrint(value.first, os) here, as T1 may be a reference type.
We chain new translations onto the end of the list, so we need to track all the fallback jumps from the "tail" translation so we can rewrire them to new ones.
We check if the next opcode is DO_FCALL in case EXT instructions are used.
We chose it to be a subset of both PCRE and POSIX extended regex, so it's easy to learn wherever you come from.
We clone the toplevel pseudomain for each context class and cache the results in m_pseudoMainCache.
We compute and store 'stack offsets' in many different places in the jit, and there are a number of different frames of reference for these offsets.
We could check which locals for compact, but for now we just include them all.
We could consider exposing this type of interrupt to clients, and thus allowing users to request the server to break execution when an interrupt handler is reached, but the value seems quite low at this time.
We could continue to evict in a loop, but if there are a lot of threads here at the same time, that could lead to spinning.
We could use three low bits on 64-bit, and maybe some high bits as well.
We currently have three versions: 0 -- This version is currently written out by all RocksDB's versions by default.
We currently provide no / supported mechanism for making a non-artificial subclass / dynamically.
We declare (but don't implement) this to prevent the compiler from implementing the assignment operator.
We default to null_array since serialization is not limited inside the VM.
We define SUPPORT_UTF if SUPPORT_UTF8 is enabled for compatibility reasons with existing code.
We define UniversalPrinter as a class template (as opposed to a function template), as we need to partially specialize it for reference types, which cannot be done with function templates.
We define a "pointer" to be an address-type / value, an object reference or any value-type (struct, enum, etc.) which / contains a reference.
We define accessors (below) to encapsulate this logic.
We define it as a different type / (instead of as a typedef) just to remove the "getFromPointer" methods and / enforce purity in the Swift codebase.
We define them anyway since we are too lazy to differentiate the architecture.
We define this to ensure that only POD is passed through ellipsis on these systems.
We define two overloaded versions of Compare().
We definitely do not need to deallocate.
We delay validation of C and Objective-C type-bridging functions in the standard library until we encounter a declaration that requires one.
We deliberately pick an unusual name for this internal method to avoid clashing with names used in user TESTs.
We derive it from std::runtime_error, which is for errors presumably detectable only at run time.
We did not have any overlapping intersection.
We didn't want to be backwards incompatible so we didn't change the return status (this is a public API).
We disallow copying TestCases.
We disallow copying TestEventListeners.
We disallow copying TestResult.
We disallow copying Tests.
We disallow copying UnitTest.
We distinguish between which of these the importer chose by the deprecation message.
We do NOT use the volatile return trick since _controlfp is a function call and thus FP registers are saved in memory anyway.
We do NOT use the volatile return trick since _controlfp_s is a function call and thus FP registers are saved in memory anyway.
We do an ordinary get and return Status::OK()
We do not anticipate changes * to experimental interfaces but reserve the right to make minor changes * if experience from use "in the wild" suggest such changes are prudent.
We do not currently use them on Windows Mobile.
We do not need to do any sorting/uniquing ourselves since we assume that our users perform this task for us.
We do not need to use the original projections here since to build / aggregate instructions the order is the only important thing.
We do not support both EBCDIC and UTF-8/16/32 at the same time.
We do not support symbolic projections yet.
We do not want to visit callee functions if we just have a value base.
We do this because of unfortunateness in SILGen, / some expressions (e.g. OpenExistentialExpr) cannot be multiply emitted in a / composable way.
We do two special-case optimizations to partially inline 'singleton' accessor functions (functions that just return a static local or static property if it's not null).
We don't always statically know what function to call from a given callsite.
We don't attempt to track their types.
We don't bother erasing `name' from any name lists---since it will not correspond to any NameData, it will be skipped during finalization anyway.
We don't care about these by themselves for witnesses.
We don't currently enforce that rule, but will start behaving badly.
We don't currently support any higher- order alignment restrictions.
We don't distinguish between our representations for direct calls to free functions and those to member functions, with the assumption that they have the same calling convention.
We don't have a lock-free algorithm for updating prev_, but we do have the option of invalidating the entire sequential-insertion cache.
We don't have libdwarf, so stub it out.
We don't have movzbq because it behaves exactly the same as movzbl but takes an extra byte.
We don't have to write KindOfUninit here, because a debug_backtrace wouldn't be able to see these slots (they are stack cells).
We don't hold the refcount here, since default column family always exists We are also not responsible for cleaning up default_cfd_cache_.
We don't intend to mangle any sort of type within this context / and so do not require its generic parameters to be bound.
We don't know for sure what's live.
We don't know what lies ahead.
We don't know what lies behind.
We don't know whether a bare name is a class/interface name or a type alias or an enum, so when this is set to Type::Object we may have to resolve a type alias or enum and test for a different DataType (see annotCompat() for details).
We don't mark it as const here, as doing so will cause a warning in the constructor of UnitTest.
We don't need to do anything in finishInitialization.
We don't need to read/scan the whole FBSON packed bytes in order to return results.
We don't need to track which condition code a conditional jump used because we take care to smash only the address and leave the code intact.
We don't protect writing to has_owner_ here, as it's the caller's responsibility to ensure that the current thread holds the mutex when this is called.
We don't recount here if there are still older updates invalidated by the tombstones.
We don't support MSVC 7.1 with exceptions disabled now.
We don't support locals being type Gen, so if we ever get into such a case, we need to punt.
We don't track this information for local ids past kMaxTrackedLocals, which are assumed to always be in this set.
We don't use 'enum class' because we want the enumerators to convert freely to uint64_t.
We don't want to put nops in Vunits representing stubs, and those Vunits don't have transKind set.
We enabled table_options.cache_index_and_filter_blocks.
We ensure that the m_expMap entry is removed before the apc key is freed, and guarantee that the key is valid as a char* if it exists in m_expMap.
We expect our users to sort/unique the input array.
We expect this to be quite small for most protocols.
We expect to see a lot of entries for keys like: ab abcdef abcdefg abcdefh corresponding to closely-related paths and different prefixes of the same path.
We fail if `canStartBlock(block)' is false.
We first try to schedule compactions based on `base_background_compactions`.
We flag a bit in ah, ch, dh, bh so byteRegNeedsRex doesn't trigger.
We found the end of the chain.
We frequently use three tag bits on all of these types.
We got woken up by somebody calling notify (as opposed to timeout), then some work might be on the queue.
We handle conditional and unconditional jumps, as well as pointers to code (via IncomingBranch::ADDR, used for example in a switch table).
We have a check in LoopRegionFunctionInfo::verify to make sure / that this stays true.
We have a matching ref count inst.
We have a pointer kind for each of the major segregated locations in which php values can live (eval stack, frame slots, properties, etc...).
We have a track record of self-deadlocking on these, and our pthread implementation tends to do crazy things when a rwlock is double-wlocked, so check and assert early in debug builds.
We have assertions that check that these interrupts stays server-side.
We have no callee-saved registers in php, and there'd be nowhere to spill these because all translations share the spill space.
We have no particular reason to destroy in either order.
We have not yet checked.
We have posixnv as an encapsulated object here so that we can use posix timers, posix threads, etc.
We have reasons for using distinct bitwise representations, though.
We have stepped out and will break on the next valid opcode
We have the next fields blocked into qword-size unions so StringData initialization can do fewer stores to initialize the fields.
We have to include / "switch" (for "break") for consistency with C: Swift doesn't / require "break" to leave a switch case, but it's still way too / similar to C's switch to allow different behavior for "break".
We have to keep at least one extra slot free so that we're guaranteed to eventually hit it when doing the hash lookup.
We have to manually implement move, because boost::dynamic_bitset doesn't support it (at the time of this writing).
We have to merge / them again.
We have to represent this as a member so we can list-initialize it.
We heap allocate a RefData when we make a reference to something.
We hold onto references to elements of this map.
We hook request start and finish to know when these events happen.
We ignore results at the top-level because we may have overloading that will be resolved properly by name binding.
We increment to the next op, so we are at the correct position when the generator is resumed.
We instead need to call the objc runtime to get the class.
We intend to mangle a type which may be dependent on the / context and so require all generic parameters to be bound.
We intentionally use a non-POD return type with these entry points to give them an indirect return ABI for compatibility with Swift.
We just updated the debug scope information.
We just want to avoid a redefinition error message.
We keep a linked list of destructors in ThreadLocalManager to be called on thread exit.
We keep a set of "factored edges" representing all possible early exits due to exceptional control flow.
We keep multiple of timeseries data at different granularity and update them simultaneously.
We know that all of our PtrSets are uniqued.
We know that both of our pointer sets are sorted, so we can essentially perform a sorted set merging algorithm to create the ID.
We know that we can only have one of each element in each list, so we can just visit I1 and continue.
We like fast allocation.
We like fast destruction and do not want to have to iterate over / potentially many of these sets and invoke destructors.
We lookup/create the region for the innermost loop that contains the / block and add the block's region as a subregion of that loop.
We lose support for NULL detection where the compiler doesn't like passing non-POD classes through ellipsis (...).
We made the mistake of declaring macros starting with double underscore.
We maintain mappings from TCAs and TransIDs to translation information, for debugging purposes only.
We maintain the invariant that a Vector and its m_immCopy share the same ArrayData buffer.
We make a copy of the key in the list node, allowing us to find the TBB::CHM element from the list node.
We map the GTEST_SNPRINTF_ macro to the appropriate function in order to achieve that.
We may expand the header to include checksum of the FBSON binary for more security.
We may have a tracked type even if we don't have an available value.
We may know the shape of an array without knowing whether it may have escalated or not.
We may not have a ldrefExit, but if so we better not be loading the inner ref.
We may run the interpreter collecting stats and when trace is on the amount of noise is unbearable.
We might be at tok::eof now, so ensure that consumeToken() does not assert about lexing past eof.
We mimic that on all platforms, though this makes us sad.
We moved one forward, but index did not change
We must not have already had our sources initialized before this function is called.
We must report iterator past the end of the range when either of the component iterators has reached the end of its range.
We must report iterators equal if they both point beyond their respective ranges.
We must still be in a single-threaded environment.
We need a separate field to passthrough custom kinds that originally came from the client, because we can't safely construct a UIdent for them.
We need all of our ViewControllers to cache layoutGuide changes so any View in our View hierarchy can access accurate layoutGuide info at any time.
We need more than mysql.h because we need CHARSET_INFO in one place.
We need the following helper functions only for their types.
We need the unwinder to ignore the half-built ActRec allocated on the stack and certainly to avoid attempting to decref its contents.
We need these two functions in runtime/base, as there are functions in runtime/base that depend on these two functions.
We need this because ASSERT_EQ(NULL, my_ptr) expands to Compare("", "", NULL, my_ptr), which requires a conversion to match the Secret* in the other overload, which would otherwise make this template match better.
We need this to alloc bigger bufs in non-PS mode
We need this to make fast allocs in rowp_read
We need this to make sure we don't mark classes with the same name Unique.
We need to / walk through every function in the module.
We need to add another callback for this.
We need to be able to reference the currently executed Generator in all cases and still being able to access the return values of finished Generators.
We need to convey the height to the Insert step, however, so that it can perform the proper links.
We need to get rid of statics if we're not actually going to do constant propagation.
We need to have types that specify unsigned 8, 16 and 32-bit integers.
We need to keep some unreferenced functions from being removed by the linker.
We need to keep these because otherwise st_mysqlnd_conn will be changed.
We need to load the unique reference from a global variable fixed up at / startup.
We need to maintain an aligned buffer for reads.
We need to set m_initVal so that method transCounter() works, and also so that newly created counters start with `value'.
We need to set the opline variable in execute_data so we don't resume at an old position.
We need to skip both of the tombstone and updates hidden by the tombstones.
We need to specify the return type explicitly, or else we may drop refs.
We never implicitly create a dict array
We only allow a very modest set of changes to a type.
We only allow explicit conversions to ArrayData.
We only allow for get result when this object is invalidated via a move.
We only allow for moves of ProjectionPath since we only want them to be / able to be constructed by calling our factory method.
We only cache __invoke methods if they are instance methods or if the class is a static closure.
We only care about the active members, which were already subsumed by the enclosing type.
We only care about the contained VarDecls.
We only care if the local is KindOfRef or not.
We only compute this once / in the lifetime of this class.
We only expire things here, so let's notify somebody else as well.
We only need the header and first few bytes of the payload after header to verify the FBSON.
We only store the tracked subset here.
We only summarize events that are non-zero for some key.
We only support the RESPONDER role.
We only try to consolidate the common array functions that should actually be called.
We only want to do this when we generate cloned functions, not when we inline.
We only write to prev_height_ if the nobody else has, to avoid invalidating the root of the skip list in all of the other CPU caches.
We operate in terms of FunctionTy, LoopTy, and BlockTy so that this can / potentially be ported to LLVM in the future.
We pad all stack overflow checks by a small amount to allow for three things:  - inlining functions without having to either do another stack check (or chase down prologues to smash checks to be bigger).
We pass through eval'able php code and a string type constraint, only for exposure to reflection.
We place a dummy function call of this inside Env::Default() to ensure the construction order of the construction order.
We probably should get rid of this, so to detect code generation errors, where a binary string is treated as a NULL-terminated literal.
We purge items from it every n (configurable) apc_stores.
We push and pop as we deal with inlined calls.
We push and pop frames as we enter and leave inlined calls.
We put all the network addresses (which are simply strings of bits) in a trie that we can match against a candidate network address.
We put our data in a struct so that the size of the AssertHelper class can be as small as possible.

We'll deprecate these at some point

We're currently checking circularity.
We're doing a baseless disp access and it is not rip-relative.

With read-ahead we always pre-allocate buffer to the size instead of growing it up to a limit.
With some pre-calculated knowledge, each key comparison that has been done can serve as a hint to narrow down further searches: if a key compared to be smaller than a file's smallest or largest, that comparison can be used to find out the right bound of next binary search.
With the "v2" prepare * interfaces, the underlying reason for the error is returned immediately.
With the existing lattice this operation is precise.
With these hints: it can greatly reduce the range of binary search, especially for bottom levels, given that one file most likely overlaps with only N files from level below (where N is max_bytes_for_level_multiplier).
With this option on, from an empty DB, we make last level the base level, which means merging L0 data into the last level, until it exceeds max_bytes_for_level_base.

Without the mutexes, it is not safe * to use SQLite concurrently from more than one thread.
Without this definition, streaming endl or other basic IO manipulators to Message will confuse the compiler.

Work done to setup a new flow command, after receiving it from the client.
Work done when a VM thread interrupts the proxy.
Workaround for a potential GCC 5 bug, value initializing m_elms seems to use zero-initialization instead of default initialization.
Workaround is to populate exactly one of the following function pointers with a non-nullptr value.
Workflow: 1) the lexer/parser creates a stack of commands and arguments from input 2) the commands at the top of the stack are resolved sensibly using aliases, abbreviations and case insensitive matching 3) the remaining arguments in the stack are verified (optionally) against the handlers declared argument specification 4) the handler is called passing the top of the stack as the only parameter 5) the stack is destroyed upon return from the handler
Worklist containing all of the instructions primed for simplification.
Worklist of SILFunctions we are processing.

You may assume if the instruction it came from is not an InlineReturn, it is a return from the entire region.
You may consider using rate_limiter to regulate write rate to device.
You may disable it by passing a zero.
You may have to go spelunking in the Intel manuals:  http://www.intel.com/products/processor/manuals/  If you're looking for something more fully baked, here are some options to consider:  1.
You may need to increase this if your database has a large working set (budget one open file per 2MB of working set).
You may need to increase this if your database has a large working set.

You need to open ALL column families in the database.
You probably should just never use this function.
You should NOT modify the reference count of the value passed to you.
You should avoid adding methods to this section.
You should be good by leaving it at default 10.
You should call this before RUN_ALL_TESTS() is called, probably in main().
You should call this before `layoutNode`.
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program.
You should skip all the rules that contain negative values for the following attributes.
You should subclass this to define your own environment(s).
You should use canonicalize before doing lookups.
You shouldn't need to access this data structure unless you are implementing a new TableFactory.
You stream a bunch of values to a Message object.
You will incur the cost of a std::map look up whenever createCounter() is called.
You will still get an assertion if the Variant is an object, resource, etc.
You'll likely want to ensure the array coming in is a temporary (so it can be modified in place).
Your implementaitn should call invokeFiltersOnClose() before anything else to make sure that any user-provided php_user_filter instances get to flush and clean up.

o In situations with inlined calls, we may in fact have AFrame locations that refer to the same concrete memory locations (in the evaluation stack) as other AStack locations in the same HHIR program.
o Iterators are invalidated on any call to a non-const member function.
o Lookups and insertions can be done through a different type than the containers actually hold.
o Moving from a set or map leaves it in an undetermined (but valid) state.
o Set operations involving multiple sets are generally only legal if both sets have the same universe size.
o The entries in this table (including 'extras') are not guaranteed to be contiguous.
o The tracelet region selector uses this code to generate a RegionDesc.
