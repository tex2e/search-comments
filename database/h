'axis' should be the array axis that is being indexed over, if known.
'base' restricts the output to that unit.
'bucketSize' specifies how many buckets to track for the histogram.
'casting' controls how the detected unit from the string is allowed to be cast to the 'unit' parameter.
'casting' controls whether data loss is allowed by truncating the data to a coarser unit.
'ci' is released after this function is returned, and must be copied if it is needed outside of this function.
'copy(source, destination)' implemented in "filesystem-shim.js" using '_copy(source, destination)'
'dest' may partially overlap the head of 'src', because the / values are taken as if in front-to-back order.
'dest' may partially overlap the tail of 'src', because the / values are taken as if in back-to-front order.
'exportPercentile' specifies at what percentile values we should report the stat.
'exportTypes' specifies what kind of statistics to export for each level.
'extra' bytes may be allocated in front of the returned pointer, must be a multiple of 16, and later be passed to ReleaseUncounted.
'glyf' table in memory
'hmtx' table in memory
'index' is the index of the test in the type list 'Types' specified in INSTANTIATE_TYPED_TEST_CASE_P(Prefix, TestCase, Types).
'inout' arguments are printed specially.
'internal' is the default, don't add it.
'join(...)' implemented in "fs.js" 'split(path)' implemented in "fs.js"
'key' and 'data' passed to zend_accel_hash_update() must be already allocated in shared memory.
'let', 'var', and 'inout' cannot be argument labels.
'levels' specifies at which granularity should the stats be tracked.
'loca' table in memory
'max' is the maximal value in the histogram.
'maxdims' is the maximum recursion depth.
'metastr' is used for the error message if the divisor doesn't work, and can be NULL if the metadata didn't come from a string.
'min' is the minimal value in the histogram.
'move(source, destination)' implemented in "filesystem-shim.js" 'touch(path)' implemented in "filesystem-shim.js" Listing
'name' must be path relative to the db directory.
'numBuckets' specifies how many buckets to keep at each level.
'num_entries' is initialized by zero and grows when new data is added.
'obj' is the object to be converted to an ndarray.
'out' gets filled with the parsed date-time.
'out_bestunit' gives a suggested unit based on the amount of resolution provided in the string, or -1 for NaT.
'out_bestunit' gives a suggested unit based on whether the object was a datetime.date or datetime.datetime object.
'out_dtype' should be either NULL or a minimal starting dtype when the function is called.
'out_special' gets set to 1 if the parsed time was 'today', 'now', or ''/'NaT'.
'parts' points to an array of Slices.
'post' table in memory
'removeDirectory(path)' implemented in "filesystem-shim.js" using '_removeDirectory(path)'
'removeTree(path)' implemented in "filesystem-shim.js" using '_removeTree(path)'
'result' may alias with op1 or op2, so we need to ensure that 'result' is not updated until after we have read the values of op1 and op2.
'ret' is a PyUString containing the datetime string, and this function appends the metadata string to it.
'self' has been consumed.
'self' is a keyword, we cannot allow to insert it into the source buffer.
'self' is a normal variable.
'self' needs to be consumed next time it is referenced.
'str' must be a NULL-terminated string, and 'len' must be its length.
'strides_name' is used to produce an error message if the strides cannot be broadcast.
'this' may be a branch or a PC-relative addressing instruction.
'tzoffset' is used if 'local' is enabled, and 'tzoffset' is set to a value other than -1.
'unit' should contain -1 if the unit is unknown, or the unit which will be used if it is.
'value_found' will be true on return if value has been set properly.
'x' / is modeled as a DeclRefExpr or OverloadSetRefExpr on the method.
( -- not really an operator, but treated as one in some cases.
() The table for aligned-pointer-to-pointer types.
(*ACCEPT) encountered
(*PRUNE) or (*SKIP) encountered
(*values) will always be resized to be the same size as (keys).
(1) 'Bitset' mode, when MSB (63th bit) is set.
(1) Allocated nodes are never deleted until the InlineSkipList is destroyed.
(1) Allocated nodes are never deleted until the SkipList is destroyed.
(1) Don't add more methods to Func here.
(1) External SST files can be created using SstFileWriter (2) We will try to ingest the files to the lowest possible level even if the file compression dont match the level compression
(1) check pre-conditions for variables
(2) 'Big-integer' mode, when MSB is not set.
(2) A key shared the same prefix as the previous key, which is encoded as format of (1).
(2) For people who are interested in implementing a high-performance HTTP server, derive a new class from Server just like LibEventServer does.
(2) For simplicity, there is no equivalent to the Slice type.
(2) It uses MemTableRep::KeyComparator to compare items for iteration and equality.
(2) SstFileReader (for SST Dump) opens the table and dump the table contents using the interator of the table.
(2) The contents of a Node except for the next/prev pointers are immutable after the Node has been linked into the InlineSkipList.
(2) The contents of a Node except for the next/prev pointers are immutable after the Node has been linked into the SkipList.
(2) after hash index checking, we identify two locations (because of hash bucket conflicts), we binary search the two location to see which one is what we need and start to read from the location.
(2) check writer settings - Queue depth cannot be 0 - writer_dispatch_size cannot be greater than writer_buffer_size - dispatch size and buffer size need to be aligned
(2) key is in between smallest and largest.
(3) A key shared the same prefix as the previous key, which is encoded as the format of (2).
(3) DBImpl::AddFile() calls this function to read the contents of the sst file it's attempting to add
(3) Errors are represented by a null-terminated c string.
(3) It can be accessed concurrently by multiple readers and can support during reads.
(3) key is larger than largest, implying it is also larger than smallest.
(4) Items are never deleted.
(A member variable pointer or member function pointer doesn't really point to a location in the address space.
(A non-static Mutex is defined/declared in the usual way).
(Also skips Hole.)  Clients can call this directly to avoid unnecessary initFree()s.
(And this means we may actually rely on whether copy elision (NRVO etc) is happening in some places for correctness.)  Use carefully.
(Basically if the next integer key in an array is already at the maximum integer.)
(But no non-persistent strings will ever have KindOfPersistentString.) so-called "uncounted" strings are persistent (not ref counted) but not static.
(CONTENT also limits the range of valid values for actions.) This maps actions to IDs.
(CalculateBaseBytes() is called) This may or may not return number of level files.
(Chrome can use two or more spellcheckers and we cannot assume their encodings.) The following snippet is an example that extracts words with this class.
(Defined outside of any other function body.)
(Destructors are not called when they come from IRUnit.)
(Does not assume that it is.)  No throw as long as V has a nothrow move assignment operator.
(Due to round-off error, etc, it's very unlikely that two floating-points will be equal exactly.
(E.g. combine common idioms or patterns, smash code, etc.)
(E.g. if there are type aliases.)
(E.g. the translator write lease.)  Key must be an atomically loadable/storable type.
(E.g. via calls to may_alias in AliasAnalysis.)
(Exact, case-sensitive comparison.)
(For example, if you are doing an include_once you need to know whether it was already included.)  o It means we should count this lookup as a request-local lookup for the current request.
(For example, mailto: URLs in the default mail user agent.)
(For instance, we have some support for "alternation", except that if we ever succeed in matching a branch, we'll never revisit it).
(I think this also applies to BSD, but we can cross that road when we come to it.)
(I.e. if the global is a KindOfRef, this will set the value in its RefData.)
(I.e. it cannot point into a RefData.)
(I.e. numeric strings are compared numerically.)
(I.e. the string may have junk after the number.)
(If not present, returns nullptr.)
(If this doesn't make sense, please don't try to use any of those APIs with this array.)  Sometimes, however, it's still necessary to deal with globals using a generic Array in extension code.
(If we actually *know* it is in an object, locTy will be a subtype of TObj.)
(In C++11, we simply use static_assert instead of the following)
(In SILGen we don't try to explode structs, because doing so / would require considering resilience, a job we want to delegate to IRGen).
(In the non-persistent region, the space for T will contain garbage at the start of each request.)  Links are atomic types.
(In this case, the snapshot-semantics of the rocksdb Iterator is not atomic anymore).
(Instead of just pumping through our m_list and m_map.)
(Integers are converted to strings.)  - size() is an O(N) operation.
(Intended for debugging purposes.)
(It can do this because it knows the addresses of all the instances from the debug information).
(It may be Gen if there was nothing interesting known.)
(It may however *be* a trait.)  - It implements no interfaces.
(It may however *be* an interface.)  - It is not an enum.
(It still implicitly converts *from* most of them.)  We're leaving these functions deleted for now because we fear the possibility of changes to overload resolution by not declaring them.
(It used to be implemented using ordered comparisons on the opcode enum, so it might be a mistake.
(It's not unusual to want to printf registers, etc.
(Known dependency in unwind-x64.h.)
(Like the lvalBlackhole, etc.)  It's hard for this to matter to client code for now because we don't expose an intersection or difference operation.
(Likely naming relic from hphpc days.)
(Negative, Zero, Carry, Overflow)
(No need for an acquire/release handshake with ourselves.)
(Not callable directly by php code.)
(Notably the universe size may be changed.)  Nothrow guarantee.
(Note that the first plus is parsed as a unary operator.)
(Note that this does not include types like TInitUnc---it's only the TOpt* types.)
(Note you can set it to something like /dev/stderr or /dev/stdout if you want the logs printed to your terminal).
(Note: the supplied block list need not be RPO-sorted.)
(Numeric strings are not treated specially.)
(Obsolete) ARC-specific: this class has a .release_ivars method.
(Offset,Length) pairs.
(Please read the comment in the SpellcheckWordIterator class about how to use this class.)
(Please read the comments in CreateRuleSets() why we need this function.)
(SEMI_)END_BUF anchor distance
(See hhbbc.)  This function accomplishes this.
(See http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jni/spec/invocation.html#attach_current_thread) If you need access to the application's classes, you can use ThreadScope::WithClassLoader.
(See kStackCheckReenterPadding and kStackCheckLeafPadding.)
(See new_iter_array.)
(See strong_iterators_exist().)  o Secondly we expect that we essentially never exceed a small number iterators (outside of code specifically designed to stress mutable array iteration).
(See the file 'LICENCE'.)
(Since iteration order is unspecified, this semantic would seem weird anyway.)  This holds a pointer to a NameValueTable whose lifetime must be guaranteed to outlast the lifetime of the GlobalsArray.
(TODO mhorowitz #7128529: this exception behavior is not yet implemented.)  There are two sets of constructors here.
(TUninits turn into TInitNull, and potentially reffy types return the "inner" type, which is always a subtype of InitCell.)
(Template arguments must be determined at compile-time.)
(The "non-inline" and "has-extra-inhabitants" bits still require additional fixup.)
(The base class destructor is only invoked for instances that point to the collection in the client.)
(The caller will pack key and value into a single buffer and pass that in as the parameter to Insert).
(The decider has a `disabled' flag for this purpose.)  - The client passes this region to shouldInline() to determine whether it is inlinable.
(The default to enable it should be 'false'.)
(The index type is a template parameter in order to allow different uses of this map to have different sized indexes).
(The original salt was 12 bits and could not swap bits 13..24 with 36..48.)  It is possible, but ugly, to warp the SPE table to account for the salt permutation.
(The returned pointer is never pointing into a RefData.)
(The stack is determined by leaf node pointers) Nodes with only one child just don't need a list, there it is enough to just have a pointer to the child node.
(The wrapper is refcounted, as required by ArrayData, but the table pointed to is not.)
(Then we rely on DCE to remove the cases that can't happen.)
(There will not be a real execution context or anything like that.)
(There's a 32-bit integer in the AtomicCountable base class here.)
(These names are intended to be / compatible with Xcode's SDKs.) / / If the triple does not correspond to a known platform, the empty string is / returned.
(This could be empty.)
(This feature is gated on being compiled with jemalloc.)
(This function uses lots of temporal memory to compile a custom word-break rule into an automaton.)
(This is also why the above selector is called the "legacy" selector.)
(This is because of kNamedLocalDataType support in the underlying NameValueTable.)  - Append/prepend operations are not supported.
(This is because the array is created as a temporary.)  Foreach by reference is a pain.
(This is either TInt or a subtype of it.)
(This is making use of the x64 property that "canonical form" addresses have all their upper bits the same as bit 47, and that this is zero for linux userland pointers.)
(This is to allow more efficient implementation of this case in some derived classes.)
(This is used to co-allocate a TypedValue with its array data.)
(This just unmasks the lowest-order bit, which designates `src' as a Cctx rather than a This.)
(This makes it usable in classes that are arena-allocated.)  Zero-initializing this class is guaranteed to produce an empty set.
(This requirement does not appear to be documented, but failing to zero-terminate causes a segfault in classify_object_over_fdes() in unwind-dw2-fde.c.
(This should generally be straightforward, as pin and / unpin may be conservatively assumed to have arbitrary / side-effects.)
(This text does not have to be NULL-terminated.) This function also resets internal state so we can reuse this iterator without calling Initialize().
(This, if this function is used in contexts where the bounds are not statically known, one must account for the opcode specific behavior of the failure case).
(Thus, if this function is used in contexts where the bounds are not statically known, TInitNull must be unioned in for correctness.)
(To retain backwards-compatibility)
(Unfortunately we can't use allocator_traits yet.)
(Unless you want the first element to remain accessible inline instead of moved to the heap.)
(Version 2.1, February 1999) Please read the following detail of the licence (in japanese).
(We don't want this to accidentally get used for things like pointers or aggregates.)  Floating point support could be added later if we need it ...
(We may want to distinguish these two cases at some point if we start trying to track real information about Refs, but not yet.)
(We over-check in these situations, but it's fine.)
(We pre-create static strings for all 256 characters at process startup.)
(We would like to make this unnecessary eventually.)
(What sort of function call is being made.)
(When a db is first created, the earliest sequence number will be 0).

- A node's local key contains no common prefix with the local keys of its left or right siblings.
- A relative reference is a (signed) offset from the address of the reference to the address of its direct referent.
- A static property of this class is accessed.
- Accounting for usage of memory "by this request", whether it goes through the request-local allocator, or the underlying malloc implementation.
- Addresses are loaded using an rip-relative lea to aid code relocation.
- An absolute reference is a pointer to the object.
- Be arena-allocatable (no non-trivial destructors).
- Can be shared between multiple dbs.
- CompactionStyle: valid values are "kCompactionStyleLevel", "kCompactionStyleUniversal", "kCompactionStyleFIFO", and "kCompactionStyleNone".
- Condition codes produce a setcc based on the status flags passed to the emit routine.
- Convenience initializer - A bridge will be created internally.
- Corruption: Merge operator reported unsuccessful merge or a corrupted key has been encountered and not expected (applies only when compiling with asserts removed).
- Corruption: Merge operator reported unsuccessful merge.
- Designated initializer -
- Does not support Merge operations.
- Does not support Snapshot.
- Each smart pointer is actually two pointers (8 bytes instead of 4).
- Eat trailing size specifications from numbers i.e. ignore 10L - More fixes for very short files  Revision 1.16  1995/03/25  22:06:45  christos - use strtoul() where it exists.
- Either CopyConstructible, or implement a clone member function that takes an arena to clone to.
- Emit `thenBlock' to `vcold' (with all other blocks in `vmain').
- Every time a pointer is assigned, the entire list of pointers to that object is traversed.
- FunctionPointerBox is a box for function pointers.
- GTEST_COMPILE_ASSERT_ works by defining an array type that has -1 elements (and thus is invalid) when the expression is false.
- Global write lease (GetWriteLease()).
- HashSkipListRep: The memtable rep that is best used for keys that are structured like "prefix:suffix" where iteration within a prefix is common and iteration across different prefixes is rare.
- If the check succeeds, the client produces a region for the callee at the appropriate entrypoint for the call.
- If the function is marked with AttrParamCoerceModeFalse, then the function can also return bool in addition to this type.
- If the returnType() is KindOfString, KindOfArray, or KindOfObject, null may also be returned.
- Implement a hash() method.
- IndirectFixup: this is used for some shared stubs in the TC.
- Insertion and removal can only happen at the end of the sequence (although you can modify elements anywhere in the sequence).
- It allows for SIL-only aggregates to exist, such as boxes.
- It allows optimizations to manipulate the layout of aggregates without requiring changes to the AST.
- It improves the robustness of code in the face of resilience.
- It is efficient to find entries that share a common prefix with a given key.
- Iteration order is not specified.
- KNS  #define HAVE_SQL_EXTENDED_FETCH 1
- Keep track the total size of all SST files.
- Likewise, if the function is marked AttrParamCoerceModeNull, null might also be returned.
- Many vectors are no larger than a particular constant size, and such vectors should be stored as compactly as possible.
- MergeInProgress: Put/Delete not encountered and unable to merge operands.
- Most vectors have no bits set, and those that do tend to have them set in coherent ranges.
- Negative numbers are used for other blocks, which correspond to blocks created by inlining and which don't correspond to the beginning of a profiling translation.
- Newly attached C++ threads only get the bootstrap class loader -- i.e. java language classes, not any of our application's classes.
- Non-string keys are not really supported.
- RB_OBJ_WRITTEN(a, oldv, b): WB for new reference from `a' to `b'.
- Set a maximum allowed space limit for SST files that when reached the DB wont do any further flushes or compactions and will set the background error.
- Since the final executable has already been produced, the shared object is embedded into the executable in a custom section.
- Sometime at start-up, the init() function is called.
- Strong iterators "past the end" are not updated when new elements are added.
- Taken edges (these are encoded in the last instruction in hhbcs).
- The contentData of GET_VALUES contains name-value pairs with only names, while the contentData of GET_VALUES_RESULT contains name-value pairs containing the values of the requested parameters.
- The elements must be trivially copyable/assignable and have trivial destructors.
- The garbage collector instantiates Scanner, calls Scanner::scan() for roots, and Scanner::scanByIndex() for values on the request heap (using the stored type-index).
- The return type is deliberately chosen to be not void, so it will be a conflict if void Setup() is declared in the user's test fixture.
- The scanner generator is run during the build, after the final link where the executable is produced.
- The simpler definition
- The type annotation macros spit out various static fields and member functions with special names.
- There is no non-const iterator support, and we have forward iterators only.
- There is no other definition for a class of the same name in its Unit.
- These generated functions, along with metadata to map the type-index to the function, is emitted as C++ code and compiled into a shared object.
- These records should be associated with the null reqeuestId.
- This class assumes pointers of L and R types never alias.
- This list of caveats may be incorrect and/or incomplete.
- This method is private, so it will be another compiler error if the method is called from the user's test fixture.
- Tracking "sweepable" objects--i.e. objects that must run custom cleanup code if they are still live at the end of the request.
- Use #if to key off these macros.
- VectorRep: This is backed by an unordered std::vector.
- a function to release a userdata struct when it is no longer being managed by the cache  In the event of a cache miss the cache is allowed to grow up to a specified maximum size.
- a small number of field names had to have an underscore appended to them, because glibc defines a global macro by the same name.
- an expression, yielding an l-value or r-value - an RValue - an LValue
- as always magdir fixes and additions.
- base is optional, implying baseless address - index is optional
- checksum : numeric, currently unused.
- cold: Cold code from all Funcs.
- current frame and stack pointers  - current function and bytecode offset
- data len : numeric, length of contents for this entry.
- data ofs : numeric, file offset of contents for this entry.
- directory size: numeric, number of dirents to follow.
- fix sign-extend bug - try to detect tar archives before nroff files, otherwise tar files where the first file starts with a .
- fix solaris compilation problems.
- flags    : numeric, see kFlag_* in cache-data.h.
- frozen: Code that is almost never used, and cold code from profiling translations.
- in a few cases, it is possible to define identical structures for both 32bit (e.g. i386) and 64bit (e.g. x86-64) platforms by standardizing on the 64bit version of the data types.
- local types and values  We track the current view of these types as we link in new instructions that mutate them.
- lock_map_mutex_ - stripe mutexes in ascending cf id, ascending stripe order - wait_txn_map_mutex_
- main: Hot code from non-AttrHot Funcs.
- name     : string, the name of this entry.
- omitting stack overflow checks on leaf functions  - delaying stack overflow checks on reentry
- overall, we try to minimize the number of cases where we need to conditionally define different structures.
- prof: Profiling translations.
- restore the old signal handler Of course, every code that allows interrupts must account for returning via the interrupt and handle clean-up correctly.
- returns false if either number is (or both are) NAN.
- run the code to be interrupted -- if an interrupt occurs the handler should basically just cause a return to the calling function for finish work.
- setting a value for an unmapped key - find the value for the smallest mapped key that is larger than a given unmapped key
- simplification pass  After the preOptimize pass, IRBuilder calls out to Simplifier to perform state-independent optimizations, like copy propagation and strength reduction.
- std::priority_queue does not have a replace-top operation, requiring a pop+push.
- tc::lockCode() gives the owning thread exclusive permission to modify the contents and frontiers of all code/data blocks in m_code.
- tc::lockMetadata() gives the owning thread exclusive permission to modify the metadata tables owned by the tc (FixupMap::recordFixup(), or tc::srcDB(), etc).
- the "struct kernel_sigaction" class of structures have been modified to more closely mimic glibc's API by introducing an anonymous union for the function pointer.
- treats really large numbers as almost equal to infinity.
- type: CPURegister::RegisterType stored as a uint32_t.
- values() contains a single element with the result of merging all the operands together
- values() contains the list of values (merges) seen in the same order.

/        This is an additional guarantee on top of the ImportTypeKind /        cases that allow bridging, and applies to the entire type.
/     All bits are considered to be zero in this case.
/     Generally this will find something from the entry block.
/     It is legal to call getAddressForInPlaceInitialization() /     multiple times.

/    E.g. if a struct contains 2 references, a mayWrite effect means that /    memory is written to one of the referenced objects (or to both).
/    In this case the effects refer to all references in the value type.
/   - A path component's implementation can be resilient and yet /     still qualify for physical access if we are in a privileged /     component.
/   - Assignments involving two B*s are only likely in /     existential code, where we won't have the right /     typing guarantees to use them (-2 operations).
/   - Generic code works with T*s a fair amount, but it usually /     doesn't have to deal with B*s after initialization /     because initialization returns a reliable pointer.
/   - Similarly, any sort of abstracted function call must go through /     a minimally-expanded entrypoint.
/   2) When a stored property satisfies a protocol requirement, these /      accessors end up as entries in the witness table.

/   If it's a value type that can't fit in three words, the data will be in /   its own heap box, so *StartOfInstanceData will be the address of that box.

Also, you can open only a subset of column families for read-only access.
Also: if you have a T*, and the list almost always contains at most one element, PointerList is a smaller object so may be preferable in that case.

Alternatively, you can also pass any output stream object to a writer, as long as the stream object implements some basic functions of std::ostream (such as FbsonOutStream, see FbsonStream.h).
Alternatively, you can avoid editing by using -D on the compiler command line to set the macro values.
Alternatively, you can pass `kPlainTableVariableLength` if your keys have variable lengths.

Although S2 is mapped to the same position as R2, it does not available in the current configuration.
Although a register is either scratch register or saved register, SLJIT allows accessing them from the other set.
Although in some platforms the update of size_t is atomic, to make sure GetUsage() and GetPinnedUsage() work correctly under any platform, we'll protect them with mutex_.

Although ref_element_addr is just a pointer addition, we / treat it as a "pointer" pointing to the elements.
Although the CPU is little endian the FP has different byte and word endianness.
Although the pointer to platform_specific is public the application  cannot have access to its members or methods since it does not know anything about them and it's a perfect incapsulation :-)

But don't call it directly, use one of the helpers below.
But eventually I came to a conclusion that having a possibility to  convert pixel formats on demand is a good idea.
But for all other platforms, it is highly recommended that applications neither read nor write this variable.
But for maximum safety, mutexes should be enabled.
But for now this interface remains part of the internal implementation and is subject to change.
But generally the goal here should be to eliminate a class of bugs by having the same (textual) code implement both serialization and deserialization.
But in any case the system dependent flags should be mapped into these ones.
But in this case it's quite appropriate bacause we have the only instance of the the_application class and it is in the same file  where this class is defined.
But internal implementations of runtime functions do not need to be exported.
But it  / quacks like a duck.
But it is kept / for other purposes: / *) It is inlined and the debug info keeps a reference to the function.
But it is not enforced.
But it is pretty reliable.
But it requires memory allocation  when creating.
But it's not guaranteed.
But not just 'Notification'
But note that it's O(size()) worst case.
But note we're also relying on the destructors not throwing.
But nothing here is going to run the constructor.
But some of the runtime entries are invoked directly from the foundation.
But that compiler magic ended up generating such a flurry of bug reports that we have taken it all out and gone back to using simple noop macros.
But that would require an additional register for the mask.
But the analysis could be extended / appropriately via simple dataflow or through the use of post-dominator / trees.
But the application does not want the user to be able to make arbitrary changes to the database.
But the main library does not want to redefine the API.
But the only way to pass data out of a parser production is via a Token, and a Token can only have data in the form of an Expression, Statement, or TypeAnnotation, so here we are.
But the optimal way to pass an Int to a function might / well be different from the optimal way to pass a String.
But the reason the mutex does not exist is because the build is not using mutexes.
But the zero register is also encoded as register 31.
But these numbers are not part of the result table itself.
But this class allows keep-alive connections to be pooled for repetitively HTTP requests.
But this is the same.
But this might change in future releases of SQLite.
But unlike Transaction::Put(), no conflict checking will be done for this key.
But we can do better.
But we can still do better.
But we currently always give classes field-offset vectors, whether they need them or not.
But we have to put the TagBit in in case we constructed a null from the right (we'll have a tagged null).
But we still need to be / conservatively correct.
But we want to be correct even in a / non-canonicalized case implying that we need to be able to support / multiple backedge blocks.
But we will have to switch to 64 bit here to support very long strings.
But when it is set, we hit it a lot.
But while "nlen" is positive we are safe.
But you should use more precise macros like DOSISH_DRIVE_LETTER, PATH_SEP, ENV_IGNORECASE or CASEFOLD_FILESYSTEM.
But you will have to use either a static buffer or allocate a dynamic buffer before beeing able to call the function.
But you will have to use either a static buffer or allocate a dynamic buffer before being able to call the function.
But zend_update_property() etc.
But, even still, the simple paradigm is complicated by at least three factors.
By "compatible" we mean that the values can be compared by the respective operator.
By Phil Knirsch based on netpbm fixes by Alan Cox.
By allowing for invalid iterators for basic blocks, / we can allow for this.
By allowing it to allocate memory, it can possibly put correlated stuff in consecutive memory area to make processor prefetching more efficient.
By calling GetWriteBatch(), a user will get the WriteBatch for the data they inserted, which can be used for DB::Write().
By calling this function, the transaction will essentially call SetSnapshot() for you right before performing the next write/GetForUpdate.
By comparing the array pointed to through m_ref with the array pointed to by m_container, MArrayIter can detect if user code has modified the inner cell to be a different array or a non-array value.
By contrast, if SQLITE_INDEX_SCAN_UNIQUE is not set and xUpdate returns SQLITE_CONSTRAINT, any database changes made by the xUpdate method are automatically rolled back by SQLite.
By convention, an edge points to the vertex opposite the edge in question.
By default RocksDB replay WAL logs and flush them on DB open, which may create very small SST files.
By default RocksDB will flush all memtables on DB close if there are unpersisted data (i.e. with WAL disabled) The flush can be skip to speedup DB close.
By default all modules are created lazily except those that have constants to export or require main thread initialization.
By default allow all opcodes.
By default handlers are "noop", that can be overridden by child classes.
By default it does nothing.
By default level based compaction will only compact the bottommost level if there is a compaction filter
By default list of sources and their thumbnail are updated once per second.
By default target_file_size_multiplier is 1, which means by default files in different levels will have similar size.
By default the entire domain of nx*ny points is contoured together which can result in some very long polygons.
By default the exposed method will match the first part of the Objective-C method selector name (up to the first colon).
By default this is nil, but you can override it with (for example) a UIActivityIndicatorView or a placeholder image.
By default this returns lower ids first (note that this is returning things that are larger according to its Compare function, like std::priority_queue).
By default this takes on the value 1.5 which is slightly higher than the internal trace profiler due to the decrease in initial buffer size.
By default, ::testing::internal::PrintTo() is used for printing the value.
By default, FbsonJsonParserT creates a new FbsonWriterT object with an output stream object.
By default, RocksDB uses only one background thread for flush and compaction.
By default, all Put/Merge/Delete operations will be indexed in the transaction so that Get/GetForUpdate/GetIterator can search for these keys.
By default, all background jobs (major compaction and memtable flush) go to the LOW priority pool.
By default, an FbsonWriterT object creates an output stream buffer.
By default, assume pointer alignment.
By default, calling align() registers alignment metadata for relocation.
By default, compaction will only call Filter() on keys written after the most recent call to GetSnapshot().
By default, does nothing.
By default, don't care about the number of values in current window when decide whether to swap windows or not.
By default, it returns an iterator for prefix seek if prefix_extractor is configured in Options.
By default, it will be set to "sys_".
By default, it will call this object's destructor automatically, so everything will be free-d.
By default, jobs go to the 'LOW' priority thread pool.
By default, only raise an NSAssertion in debug mode (custom assert functions will still be called).
By default, print C string as pointers to be safe, as we don't know whether they actually point to a NUL-terminated string.
By default, static allocated buffer is used.
By default, sync only data.
By default, the auxiliary write ahead log and shared memory files used for transaction control are automatically deleted when the latest connection to the database closes.
By default, the buffer capacity is 1024 bytes.
By default, the instructions may, or may not set the CPU status flags.
By default, the internal pointer is null.
By default, this / is the target triple, but this may be overridden to accommodate some / platforms.
By default, we assume that stream redirection is supported on all platforms except known mobile ones.
By default, we set it to true for MANIFEST writes and false for WAL writes
By default, we use the standard "extern" declarations.
By definition, FT_FIXED as 2 16bit values stored in a single long.
By definition, this maps 'FOO' to 'CanFOO'.
By doing it, we give max_bytes_for_level_multiplier a priority against max_bytes_for_level_base, for a more predictable LSM tree shape.
By doing this, we guarantee that compaction will only happen in a column family.
By inheriting OpaqueNSError, the SwiftError structure reserves enough space within itself to lazily emplace an NSError instance, and gets Core Foundation's refcounting scheme.
By making sure BOOST_HAS_TR1_TUPLE is undefined, we force Boost to use its own tuple implementation.
By overriding  system calls with functions under its control, a test program can simulate faults and error conditions that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to induce.
By putting a wrapper around the null pointer, it makes / it more likely that the null pointer case will be handled correctly.
By setting ROCKSDB_XFUNC_TEST, all XFUNC_TEST having that value in the condition field will be executed.
By tracing up the loop nest / hierarchy by these loop exits, we can find the unreachable regions in the / parent and ignore them.
By using HPHP::String instead of other string types, we are able to build maps where we just reuse them so we avoid copying.
By-value send is not allowed -- emit a warning, but still perform the call.
Bypass the implicit tcache for this deallocation.

For each of the exiting regions of the subloop (that is the regions / inside the loop that leave the subloop): / /   a.
For each of the removed edges additionally we / introduce an "exiting edge".
For each option, a short name, long name, and default value is returned.
For each primary output file there is a base input.
For each static local, we need to keep the php code around for reflection.
For each table that is not excluded by the filter callback, this function  tests that the target database contains a compatible table.
For each unique primary key value, data is only recorded once - the first time a row with said primary key is inserted, updated or deleted in the lifetime of the session.
For efficiency reasons, we don't represent the details of the object here.
For encoding type kPrefix, the value will be used when writing to determine an interval to rewrite the full key.
For every argument in the function, check to see whether all epilogue / releases are found.
For every file that is not fully synced, make a call to `func` with FileState of the file as the parameter.
For example '-1' for the previous page or 1 for the next page.
For example RCTShadowText has children which it does not want CSSLayout to lay out so in the eyes of CSSLayout it is a leaf node.
For example a "mutating set" accessor.
For example aliasing information is not taken into account.
For example, "bar///foo" becomes "bar/foo".
For example, "p + (q - p)" may not be exactly equal to q.
For example, *A*:Foo.* is a filter that matches any string that contains the character 'A' or starts with "Foo.".
For example, / if the primary locator refers to a function argument, the target locator / will be set to refer to the corresponding function parameter.
For example, a /     computed variable can still be fragile, meaning that it is known /     to be implemented with a getter/setter.
For example, a ClassStatement generates different source code, depending on whether we are generating a header file or an implementation file.
For example, a Type only supports SpecKind::Class if its bits intersect nontrivially with kAnyObj.
For example, a basic block may appear to have a single predecessor, but that may be because a different predecessor has not yet been added.
For example, a cache where the values are variable length strings, may use the length of the string as the charge for the string.
For example, a negative month number will result in the return of zero for the SDN.
For example, a test case for the Foo class can be named FooTest.
For example, a user breakpoint has been reached, or a step command has completed.
For example, all heap objects have a pointer to some metadata describing it, so pointers to class instances can eventually lead to their metadata.
For example, an application may allow a user to enter arbitrary SQL queries for evaluation by a database.
For example, an application that does not care about crash recovery or rollback might make the open of a journal file a no-op.
For example, for ASSERT_EQ(foo, bar) where foo is 5 and bar is 6, we have:
For example, for variable references it is the / variable type, for function calls it is the return type.
For example, four registers can be used as scratch registers and the fifth one as saved register on the architecture above.
For example, function ids, class ids, string literal ids.
For example, http://*.google.com encompasses http://www.google.com.
For example, if Foo() calls Bar(), which in turn calls GetCurrentOsStackTraceExceptTop(..., 1), Foo() will be included in the trace but Bar() and GetCurrentOsStackTraceExceptTop() won't.
For example, if a regular thread_local variable A is declared in DBImpl, two DBImpl objects would share the same A.
For example, if an application specifies kBlockCacheTier then the Get call will process data that is already processed in the memtable or the block cache.
For example, if an element is unset, the MArrayIter's that were pointing to that element are moved to point to the element before the element being unset.
For example, if kbd_ctrl is set it means that the  ctrl key is pressed and being held at the moment.
For example, if the PreClass "extends Foo", and Foo is defined differently in different requests, we will make a different Class.
For example, if the comparator ignores trailing spaces, it would be incorrect to use a FilterPolicy (like NewBloomFilterPolicy) that does not ignore trailing spaces in keys.
For example, if this is a VarDecl for "x", the pattern / may be "(x, y)" and the initializer on the PatternBindingDecl may be / "(1,2)" or "foo()".
For example, if this is a VarDecl for "x", the pattern may be / "(x, y)" and the initializer on the PatternBindingDecl may be "(1,2)" or / "foo()".
For example, if we need to break for the debugger, or enable code coverage mode.
For example, if you define IsEven predicate:
For example, if your compiler doesn't have a 64 bit integer type you can still use AGG if you define the follows:
For example, in Json, inside an array, entries are not keyed.
For example, in: /   (Int, ((Float, (), Double))) / the Int member is numbered 0, the Float is numbered 1, and the Double is / numbered 2.
For example, it can be called with color type "rgba", while "rgba8" is needed.
For example, it can eliminate redundant guards.
For example, it could be a resilient struct or / something of unknown size.
For example, it is the RocksDB background flush thread that does the actual flush to call EventListener::OnFlushCompleted().
For example, it might allocate any require mutexes or initialize internal data structures.
For example, it returns Russian words even though we need English words only.
For example, it transforms
For example, something like void __cdecl function(....) might be needed.
For example, suffix would be "5" for the property "rocksdb.num-files-at-level5".
For example, the copy constructor is not a copy constructor (it unboxes refs and converts KindOfUninit to KindOfNull).
For example, the length of a single-character repeat may vary in UTF-8 mode.
For example, the value of "key" will be "v3" after the following batch is written:
For example, they return combined accent marks even though we need English words only.
For example, this instantiates tests from test case BarTest each with values "one", "two", and "three":
For example, this would be reasonable to use to describe the unoccupied bits in a memory layout.
For example, type definitions inside functions are relatively rare, and also expensive to find (because there are so many functions), so the parser may not make the effort to find these.
For example, we can simultaneously compute the avg of some counter value over the last 5 minutes, 10 minutes and hour.
For example, we may know the name of a class in a res::Class, but do not know for sure which php::Class struct is actually associated with it.
For example, we use Timers for optimize, optimize_dce, optimize_jumpOpts, and others.
For example, when rate_bytes_per_sec is set to 10MB/s and refill_period_us is set to 100ms, then 1MB is refilled every 100ms internally.
For example, when the host instruction / is known to correspond to the beginning or the end of the source / range of the ASTNode.
For example, when we set a word "_hello_" to a word-break iterator, it just returns "_hello_".
For example, win32 API can natively display  gray8, 15-bit RGB, 24-bit BGR, and 32-bit BGRA formats.
For example, you can define a global variable like this:
For example, you could use it to verify the size of a static array:
For example, zero or a small immediate is usually cheaper to materialize than a larger value that may require multiple instructions or a bigger encoding.
For example: methods, properties, class constants.
For examples, properties from base classes or a global variable.

However Electron is linking with VC++ library statically, so electron.exe shares a different instance of VC++ library with node.exe.
However during optimization the ClassAnalysis is not available and the PropState has to be retrieved off the Class in the Index. In that case cls is nullptr and the PropState fields are populated.
However some architectures (i.e: ARM64 or MIPS) may employ special optimizations here.
However some architectures (i.e: MIPS) may employ special optimizations here.
However the key may exists already a be a primed mapped to file entry
However when it's being build (in hhbbc) it's creating them in parallel, and probably will lots of duplicate types.
However you will need to ensure that the endianness at the reader side is the same as that at the writer side (if they are on different machines).
However, 4 registers are virtual on x86-32.
However, HHVM allows arrays to be shared by multiple things (and it uses refcounting to keep track of how many things own a reference to the array).
However, I might not be the case in the future
However, I received a request for an even bigger limit.
However, PCRE can also be compiled to use 3 or 4 bytes instead.
However, Push() will also "write the current item to the result".
However, a ThreadLocalPtr that is defined under the scope of DBImpl can avoid such confliction.
However, a non-prefix query like '1st' will match against "1st" and "first".
However, all EventListener call-back functions should not run for an extended period of time before the function returns, otherwise RocksDB may be blocked.
However, almost all the bits in the options word are now used.
However, because extra entries are added to the FTS index, this method uses more space within the database.
However, because two levels must be considered, each level has its own set of saddle and visited flags and indeed some extra visited flags for boundary edges.
However, chances are some of the backups are consistent.
However, deleting a move assignment operator causes the copy constructor to be implicitly deleted, and its still passed in registers.
However, doing DB::CompactFiles() and DB::Put() in a thread other than the EventListener callback thread is considered safe.
However, doing DB::CompactFiles() and DB::Put() in another thread is considered safe.
However, experience has shown that many of these result codes are too coarse-grained.
However, failure to zero-fill short reads will eventually lead to database corruption.
However, flags that only have a single value may / (and should) be overwritten by this method.
However, for maximum code portability it is recommended that applications still make the distinction between protected and unprotected sqlite3_value objects even when not strictly required.
However, for performance reasons, we need to make sure certain functions get inlined.
However, if an application running in a  low-memory environment is required to handle very large changesets, the large contiguous memory allocations required can become onerous.
However, if the / addition of a member is delayed---for example, because it's / being introduced in response to name lookup---this method can be / called to make it immediately visible.
However, if the compaction filter overrides IgnoreSnapshots to make it return true, the compaction filter will be called even if the keys were written before the last snapshot.
However, if the database file is being synced as part of a multi-database commit, the argument points to a nul-terminated string containing the transactions master-journal file name.
However, if the mutex is hot, we could end up wasting spin time.
However, if this function returns non-zero, then it is guaranteed that a call to sqlite3session_changeset() will return a  changeset containing zero changes.
However, if we throw, the unwinder won't think we're in the FPI region yet.
However, in case where the static variable inside Instance() goes out of scope, MemberMutex() should be used.
However, in some systems (BeOS) it's not so.
However, in the final pass, other threads might be optimizing a callee's bytecode and changing it, so we should not be reading from it to perform type inference concurrently.
However, it also requires the cases to be dynamically distinguished.
However, it can be recovered from the instructions that need to do so.
However, it causes trouble with GCC and thus needs to be conditionally compiled.
However, it does not always fully describe / the abstraction pattern.
However, it does not support prefix queries very well.
However, it does not work on non-jailbroken iOS devices, although the compilation is successful.
However, it doesn't matter if they're placed in a public/protected/private section.
However, it expects to allocate raw memory of N bytes, while the standard allocator interface allocates N instances of type T.
However, it implies that the resulting class lifetime will be managed by two conflicting mechanisms: JavaScript garbage collection and Chromium reference counting.
However, it is extremely useful to / represent this as a distinct type in SIL and IR-generation.
However, it is inadequate when the expression does / not provide structure at the appropriate level, i.e. when that / level is substituted in: when the original type is merely T.
However, it is legal for rTmp to be a source for some other destination.
However, it is often used as system time such as in GenericRateLimiter and other places so a port needs to return system time in order to work.
However, it is still possible to return to the address of the caller (or anywhere else).
However, it needn't support multiple concurrent writes.
However, it would not be okay to / return +0 for a load from a mutable 'var', because that could / be mutated before the end of the statement.
However, methods that deal with initializing and destructing Pairs needs to handle intermediate states where one or both of the elements is uninitialized.
However, multiple filters may be in existence and operating concurrently.
However, negative block IDs logically correspond to blocks without associated translations---hence, negative TransID's are simply invalid.
However, new applications should avoid the use of these functions.
However, no changes will be recorded in either of these scenarios.
However, note that the end / location is the start of the last token in the range, not the last character / in the range.
However, notice that the new types may result in inconsistent operand types for instructions that are unreachable (but not yet removed from the IR unit).
However, other types may still refer to them (though this is very rare), so they need to be represented somehow without actually parsing them.
However, recall / that the Pattern may be involved in initializing more than just this one / vardecl.
However, since we don't have back pointers to find them, instead we leave the Class in a zombie state.
However, some code fragments (like inline cache) may have no normal entry point so their context is unknown for the compiler.
However, such calls must not close the database connection nor finalize or reset the prepared statement in which the function is running.
However, the CPU might not ignore those higher 32 bits, like MIPS, which expects it to be the sign extension of the lower 32 bit.
However, the Zend resource can be freed before ZendResourceData is released.
However, the automatic detection is not perfect.

However, the names aren't sufficient to determine equality of two different object types.
However, the parser will not include it in serialization and verification processes.
However, the portions of the HHIR program that may use that memory location in either of those ways may not overlap, based on the HHBC semantics of function calls and eval stack usage.
However, the signature of the callback function allows SQLite to pass it an array of void* context pointers.
However, the sqlite3_backup_remaining() and sqlite3_backup_pagecount() APIs are not strictly speaking threadsafe.
However, the stack is a little more complicated.
However, the two may differ in cases where user code has modified the inner cell to be a different array or non-array value.
However, there is no / join of D and A (or D and B, or D and C) because there is no common / superclass.
However, there is no compile-time way of detecting whether they are enabled or not.
However, they are 'committed' to the manifest in FIFO order to maintain correctness and recoverability from a crash.
However, they shouldn't persist in the AST, and / don't need to be parsed, printed, or serialized.
However, they're only profitable if there wasn't any other indirect reference to the target, and it is likely that their optimal use requires a more intelligent toolchain from top to bottom.
However, this can be / solved dynamically by applying thunks with a runtime function that / can recognize and bypass its own previous handiwork.
However, this means we have to continue scanning the array to find all matching edges, not just the first.
However, this return value does not indicate that there is no more memory (does not set the current error code of the compiler to out-of-memory status).
However, we augment that pattern with a pin/unpin mechanism.
However, we cannot cast it to const void* directly, even using reinterpret_cast, as earlier versions of gcc (e.g. 3.4.5) cannot compile the cast when p is a function pointer.
However, we do use a variable to ensure that the expression passed into val will be evaluated before* switching back contexts.
However, we guarantee consistent ThreadStatusData all the time whenever user call GetThreadList().
However, we guarantee precise representation of any single ID, and any subset of of IDs below 62.
However, we leave the interface to the outside world as char * or short *, because that should make things easier for callers.
However, when loading from an Objective-C object, / this metadata may not have the heap-metadata header, and it may / not be the Swift type metadata for the object's dynamic type.
However, whenever we have a value, the type of the SSATmp must match this `type' field.
However, while the pin / is held, the code is considered within a "critical region".
However, you always need to specify default column family.
However, you can also pass in your FbsonWriterT or any stream object that implements some basic interface of std::ostream (see FbsonStream.h).
However, you can use the static method "createValue" to get any FbsonValue object from the packed bytes.
However, you may want to scan a countable type in certain contexts (for example, a countable type which can be both allocated in memory and the stack).

I am not sure if this is a runtime/compiler bug, or a limitation I do not understand.
I and D cache line size in bytes.
I and D caches are not automatically coherent on ARM so this operation is required before any dynamically generated code can safely run.

Ideally those passes would become general enough / not to need this.
Ideally we will use these as little as possible in the long term.
Ideally, casting a non-resource value to a resource would throw or produce null, but there are a few places in the runtime and the extensions that would need to be updated first to make that work.
Ideas: 1) Start by implementing an approach that works on platforms that can use setjmp and longjmp functionality and does nothing on other platforms.

If such a conversion is possible without loss of information (in other words, if the value is a string that looks like a number) then the conversion is performed.
If such a row is found and one or more of the non-primary key fields have been modified from their original values, an UPDATE change is added to  the changeset.
If such a row is inserted or deleted, no corresponding change is present in the changesets returned by this function.

If t contains TUninit, returns the best type we can that contains at least everything t contains, but doesn't contain TUninit.
If tests are operating on W registers, a subsequent write into an aliased W register should clear the top word anyway, so clobbering the full X registers should make tests more rigorous.
If that changes, APIs like getLocForEndOfToken will /   need to take a LangOptions explicitly.

If the ReadOptions.read_tier is set to do a read-only fetch, then value_found will be set to false if it cannot be determined whether this value exists without doing IO.
If the RepoAuthType carries strings, they are stored as Id's, and how to look up the Id depends on whether we're pulling it out of a UnitEmitter or a Unit, so it's overloaded.

If the SILBuilder client wants to know about new instructions, record this.
If the SQL statement does not currently point to a valid row, or if the column index is out of range, the result is undefined.

If the caller cannot promise to zero the object during destruction, then call these corresponding APIs:
If the caller does not want to fetch the keys about to be written, they may want to avoid indexing as a performance optimization.
If the caller is holding an active db snapshot, we know that no key could have existing after this snapshot (since we do not compact keys that have an earlier snapshot).
If the caller is not going to call Finish(), it must call Abandon() before destroying this builder.
If the caller makes another read call, the results may not be valid.
If the caller of this function needs to push the stored value on stack, it should set 'incRefNew' so that 'newVal' will have its ref-count incremented.
If the caller wants to obtain value when the key is found in memory, a bool for 'value_found' must be passed.
If the cast represents an implicit / conversion, Coercion is returned.
If the change is an UPDATE and does not include a new value for the requested column, *ppValue is set to NULL and  SQLITE_OK returned.

In many cases, method (1) above is the best approach.
In mmaped mode, the results point to mmaped area of the file, which means it is always valid before closing the file.
In more complicated hierarchies, however, it is occasionally useful to inherit separately from Test and WithParamInterface.
In most architectures it is implemented as an SLJIT_FCMP operation (setting appropriate flags) followed by a sljit_emit_jump.
In most architectures it is implemented as an SLJIT_SUB operation (with SLJIT_UNUSED destination and setting appropriate flags) followed by a sljit_emit_jump.

In preparation for the future implementation of this mode, there are macros that load a data item and, if in this special mode, mask it to 21 bits.
In principle, people compiling for non-Windows, non-Unix-like (i.e. uncommon, special-purpose environments) might want to stick other stuff in front of exported symbols.

In release mode (SLJIT_DEBUG is not defined) only the following external functions are needed:
In repo mode, traits are flattened ahead of time, and preClass() refers to the class which imported the trait.
In repo mode, we flatten traits into the classes they're used in, so we need this to track the original file for backtraces and errors.

In some cases, might not be valid until fetch (at the driver level) has been called at least once.
In some cases, we may not have a BGC handy, in which case we should delegate to the inherited conformance for the decl context.
In some command line programs that use the repo, it is necessary to shut it down at some point in the process.
In some contexts this warning is false positive and needs to be suppressed.
In some environments it is desirable to limit the depth of recursive calls of match() more strictly, in order to restrict the maximum amount of stack (or heap, if NO_RECURSE is defined) that is used.
In such a case, the compiler might have gone so far / as to map the entire object readonly, or we might just want to avoid / dirtying memory unnecessarily.
In such a case, there is no point in exploding the argument.
In such a case, we return early returning S1 without any loss of generality.
In such cases, we should never crash and ideally when an element is unset we should be able to keep track of where we are in the array.
In testing scenarios this can happen multiple times if extensions are unloaded and reloaded.
In that case the entry is *not* in the LRU.
In that case the entry is in not on LRU and not in table.

In that case, use this marker instead.
In that case, we feed MemTableInserter dummy ColumnFamilyHandle and enable it to call DBImpl methods
In that case, we reallocate buffer and delete the old one.
In that sense the value is safe to compare against in a less-than relationship.
In that state: ) Compaction and flush is not executed on the dropped column family.

In the default implementation, PartialMergeMulti will invoke PartialMerge multiple times, where each time it only merges two operands.
In the event of (1) the only reference to the free'd object will be the object in m_cache, and as such an raw ObjectData* is used as a quasi-weak pointer.
In the event of an error, this function will return / a negative value indicating a failure to execute.
In the event of an error, this function will return a negative / value indicating a failure to execute.
In the far future, only the attribute check will be needed.
In the first pass, we use the line number of the "g" command to tag the faces.
In the first sweep it looks only for start points that occur on boundaries, and when it finds one it follows the contour through the interior until it finishes on another boundary edge.
In the following example all tests in the test case FlagDependentTest will be instantiated twice with parameters false and true.
In the following sample, tests from test case FooTest are instantiated each three times with parameter values 3, 5, and 8:
In the former case the client frees the memory.
In the former case the reader will immediately drop to the next level since nullptr sorts after all keys.
In the former case, field type metadata is not emitted, and must be obtained from the Objective-C runtime.
In the former case, the mixed_consumer member will always be nullptr, and the consumer parameter to these two following functions must be specified.
In the future, maybe some components will be cheaper (no loads, like loading from a superclass's metadata) or more expensive (multiple loads, or even a call).
In the future, this may become an / actual operation within the language.
In the future, we may restrict hdf_destroy so it only works on the top level node.

In the wonderful new world of gd 2.0, you can of course have many more colors when using truecolor mode.
In theory, defining stuff in the ::std namespace is undefined behavior.
In these cases we represent the / conformance as a null ProtocolConformance* pointer, because there is no / static conformance associated with the conforming type.
In these situations, we set up a "strange marker" by calling updateMarker() before the instruction is done (but after the pre-live ActRec is pushed).
In this case *piOff is always set to -1.

In this case there must be an adjacent deallocating / instruction.
In this case we assume a simple  grayscale image 1-byte per pixel.
In this case we just move the focal center by one subpixel unit possibly in the direction to the origin (0,0) and calculate the values again.
In this case we need the statements to be executed, the regex is ignored, and the macro must accept a streamed message even though the message is never printed.
In this case we need to create a vtable stub for it.
In this case we'll have nulls after the first non-null entry here.
In this case we'll just explicitly forbid these operations since they may lead users to make false assumption by thinking they are inexpensive operations.
In this case,  because the index contains entries for both "first" and "1st", prefix queries such as 'fi*' or '1s*' will match correctly.
In this case, /     'value' is a pointer to the memory (and thus, its type is always an /     address) and the 'box' is nil.
In this case, Data contains /     a single chunk, with its unused high bits zeroed like in the /     out-of-line case.

In this mode non hh units will default to weak types and scalar types will be available outside the HH namespace.
In this mode, no threads or semaphores or timers are created, since they are not needed.
In this phase, identifiers are references / to the enclosing scopes, not a variable binding.
In this situation, we have to be careful not to have every thread simultaneously attempt to evict the extra entries, since we could end up underfilled.
In this state this node / is completely unlinked from the graph,
In this way, by maintaining a relatively sparse set of entries in a vector, we can use least upper bound searches on an offset key to find its corresponding T.
In those situations, it can be assumed that something went wrong with the parent process and the best recovery approach is to attempt relaunch anyway.
In truth some of them may not be due to deficiencies in loop / info.

Most SQL functions are deterministic.
Most SQL statements are evaluated outside of any trigger.
Most SQLite builds come with a single default VFS that is appropriate for the host computer.
Most actions produce only a single output file, so we return 0 by default.

Most methods require DB mutex held, unless otherwise noted
Most methods that operate on Pairs can safely assume that all Pairs have two elements that have been initialized.

Most strong iterator operations from arrays should be guarded on checking this first, and placed in an unlikely path.
Most system registers only implement a few of the bits in the word.
Most systems provide rand() but the period varies.
Most things won't have attributes, so we've made the map optimize for the case that it's empty (minimizing sizeof(UserAttributeMap)).
Most usable in different cache systems for efficient memory allocations.
Most users don't need to concern themselves with any of this, as most of the complexity is hidden behind the allocator interface and standard container replacements.
Most value-parameterized classes can ignore the existence of WithParamInterface, and can just inherit from ::testing::TestWithParam.

NOTE: We don't plan to support this API permanently (this method will be removed after we track down why a valid sourceURL fails to load sometimes).
NOTE: We don't support files bigger than 2GB
NOTE: We used to skip this very short segments, but if you have a lot of them cumulatively, you can miss maxima or minima in the data.
NOTE: When switching from "false" to "true", only the pages created from that point on will be owned.
NOTE: With the NPY_FR_B gap for 1.6 ABI compatibility, NPY_DATETIME_NUMUNITS is technically one more than the actual number of units.
NOTE: do not change the values of existing entries, as these are part of the persistent format on disk.
NOTE: for the hash based lookup, if a key prefix doesn't match any key, the iterator will simply be set as "invalid", rather than returning the key that is just pass the target key.
NOTE: iImage specifies the image to start on.

Note  RUSAGE_CHILDREN is not implemented, and the RUSAGE_THREAD will  therefore instead be used instead to emulate the behavior.
Note / that this is not state kept as part of SolverState, so it only supports / function attributes that need to be set invariant of the actual typing of / the solution.
Note / that we still do compile-time availability checking with '*', so the / compiler will still catch references to potentially unavailable symbols.
Note header in a PT_NOTE section
Note some DB views only show the first nine characters of the driver name.
Note sure if STL or toolchain bug, so disable RTTI when detected.
Note that (as usual) memory locations we haven't assigned bits to may still be affected, but this module only reports effects on locations assigned bits.
Note that / expressions like '(4)' are represented with a ParenExpr.
Note that / this node may be different than the refined range.
Note that ActRecs are also native frames, so this is an implicit machine dependency.
Note that CAST128 and CAST5 are the same algorithm
Note that NULL termination is needed even for a binary string, because String class only wraps such a "safe" one that can work with any functions that takes a C-string.
Note that PGO always has a coherent notion of TransID---the so-called `profTransID', which is just the region block ID (which are globally unique).
Note that RFC allows many occurrences of the same parameter.

Note that address-only / types are not legal to manipulate directly as objects in SIL.
Note that all of the values between EndOfAccepted and MaxSize should have the same score, because otherwise there's a tier we shouldn't have marked dead.

Note that all types we see that could go into an object property have to loosen_statics and loosen_values.
Note that all-zero must / be a valid state for the cache.
Note that call-back functions should not run for an extended period of time before the function returns, otherwise RocksDB may be blocked.
Note that calling this method may throw if the failure callback throws an exception or raises a fatal error.
Note that calls that have been weakened to CallBuiltin use GeneralEffects, not CallEffects.
Note that changing the underlying TableFactory options while the TableFactory is currently used by any open DB is undefined behavior.
Note that column families are not deleted until all data are obsolete, so this iterator can possibly access obsolete key value pairs.

Note that currently we do not support units.
Note that div may overflow fixnum.
Note that each request handler may be invoked multiple times for different requests.
Note that even if the string/array is already uncounted but not static, we still have to make a copy, as we have no idea about the lifetime of the other uncounted item here.
Note that even though debug information (in general) can encode information for a variety of languages, these interfaces assume the source language is C or C++.
Note that even when "N" is changed, the specified number for "D" will not be changed.
Note that explicitly calling req::destroy_raw will run the destructors, but if you let the allocator sweep it the destructors will not be called.

Note that for an FPush* may be set to the (statically known Func* that /this/ instruction is pushing)
Note that for memory usage inside Cache class, we will only report the usage of the input "cache_set" without including those Cache usage inside the input list "dbs" of DBs.
Note that function and class names are in separate namespaces, so it is possible to have a Func and Class which share a name but both of which are unique.
Note that gdImageColorTransparent is usually compatible with older browsers that do not understand full alpha channels well.
Note that generally speaking a RefData should never contain KindOfUninit, *except* uninitialized RefDatas for this RDS case.
Note that here we prefer function static variable instead of the usual global static variable.
Note that if EvalJitEnableRenameFunction is set, no Func is unique.
Note that if an error is returned, the caller must free the non-zero references in out_dtype.
Note that if applications would like to use the passed reference outside this function call, they should make copies from the returned value.
Note that if applications would like to use the passed reference outside this function call, they should make copies from these returned value.
Note that if cls and name are both too generic this object will have to give up all information it knows about any public static properties.
Note that if func was declared noexcept, then both gcc and clang are smart enough to elide the try/catch.
Note that if test is "filesystem", this may fail whereas MatchesURL may succeed.
Note that if the filter encoding changes in an incompatible way, the name returned by this method must be changed.

Note that in bytecode.specification, refs are abbreviated as "V".
Note that it could overrun the buffer by up to 7 bytes, depending on len and alignment of the buffers.
Note that it is possible for an iterator to point to the position before the first element (this is what the "reset" flag is for).
Note that it is up to the / caller to ensure that prior stages have already been handled.
Note that it may be worthwhile to further check if the stride is a contiguous stride and take advantage of that.
Note that it's O(size()) worst case.
Note that it's not designed to be constant as in the future we might consider adding global count to the OperationInfo.
Note that its usually best to at least start by bisecting with name2 only, since (for some optimizations) skipping earlier optimizations can change later results.
Note that last might not be taken_block.
Note that m_status doesn't contain server health information.
Note that made_waitable is tracked separately from state transitions, because we can't atomically create the mutex and link into the list.
Note that mask is not stored as once it has been used to initialise the cache it is no longer needed.
Note that memory in big blocks is explicitly excluded.
Note that mg_printf() uses internal buffer of size IO_BUF_SIZE (8 Kb by default) as temporary message storage for formatting.
Note that multiple / ambiguous solutions for the same constraint system are considered to be / success by this API.
Note that nothing prevents using non-POD types with this.
Note that object types return raw pointers which generally should promptly get a wrap_local treatment.
Note that once a table is  attached, xFilter will not be called again.
Note that one transport object is created for each request, and one transport is ONLY accessed from one single thread.
Note that one transport object is created for each request.
Note that only Macintosh Internet Explorer and (possibly) Netscape 6 really support multiple levels of transparency in palettes, to my knowledge, as of 2/15/01.
Note that parsing for the body was delayed.
Note that pcre_study() has its own set of options.
Note that php5 xdebug doesn't actually raise an error on extra/invalid args.
Note that php5 xdebug doesn't distinguish internally between this and a conditional breakpoint (which is in the spec) The encoded condition is kept around for display purposes.
Note that previous value of `info` is reset, even upon failure.
Note that receiving this notification does not necessarily mean the process will exit because the shutdown process can be cancelled by an unload handler.
Note that removing this object from the listener list with Release transfers its ownership to the caller and makes this function return NULL the next time.
Note that since deletion occurs during the destructor, no further error handling is possible if the directory fails to be deleted.
Note that size is per register, and is specified in bytes.
Note that some logical operations are not available to immediate-operand instructions, so we have to combine two masks here.
Note that some of the more obscure formatting options from recent C-library standards are omitted from this implementation.
Note that some of them may not apply to the current page.
Note that sometimes ArrayIter objects are created without running their C++ constructor.
Note that stringstream behaves differently in gcc and in MSVC.
Note that struct-like arrays will be subtypes of map-like arrays with string keys.

Note that swift_allocateGenericClassMetadata will / never produce a metadata that requires relocation.
Note that system classes cannot be redeclared.
Note that tar can determine that the USTAR format is being used by the presence of the null-terminated string "ustar" in the magic field.
Note that the CGPathRef must be released by the caller.
Note that the Chrome cache directories are actually subdirectories of this directory, with names like "Cache" and "Media Cache".
Note that the Context is adjusted to account for the fact that Closure __invoke methods run in the context of a class other than their declaring class.
Note that the HHVM_RCC_* macros expect a StaticString to be present via s_##class_name.
Note that the JIT accesses RDS RefDatas directly---if you need to change how initialization works it keep that up to date.
Note that the SQLITE_TEXT constant was also used in SQLite version 2 for a completely different meaning.
Note that the WitnessTables field is accessed via / spooky action from Header.
Note that the all the pointer options (except table_factory, which will be described in more details below) will be initialized with the default values.
Note that the behavior is different from CompactRange() in that CompactFiles() performs the compaction job using the CURRENT thread.
Note that the bit for __unset is further down due to Attr-sharing across types.
Note that the block size specified here corresponds to uncompressed data.
Note that the caller must check the NULL return.
Note that the chain holds / every use of the current ValueBase, not just those of the / designated result.
Note that the code for processing them assumes that the values are less than 16.
Note that the code may have been emitted by other threads.

Note that the cost of load-time work also includes a binary-size penalty to store the loader metadata necessary to perform that work.
Note that the d'tor is not virtual in order to be efficient.
Note that the debug parser does not make any attempt to determine which object types are the same.
Note that the filter should  only be used with premultiplied pixel formats (or those without alpha).

Note that the memory for Y, U, V buffers is alloacted in one chunk, hence one should call free(*p_Y) only.
Note that the notion of "last BC offset" only makes sense for regions that are linear traces.
Note that the partial specialization for full applies inherits from this.
Note that the returned sizes measure file system space usage, so if the user data compresses by a factor of ten, the returned sizes will be one-tenth the size of the corresponding user data size.
Note that the semantics are that all keys are present at all times.
Note that the serialization of a Footer will always occupy at least kMinEncodedLength bytes.
Note that the size of this sparse map is based on the number of blocks when this LoopAnalysis structure was created.
Note that the state must be aligned to access 'long long' fields.
Note that the string must be changed accordingly when the associated function name changed.
Note that the structure of the sqlite3_vfs object changes in the transaction between SQLite version 3.5.9 and 3.6.0 and yet the iVersion field was not modified.
Note that the this function must be implemented in a way such that it should not run for an extended period of time before the function returns.
Note that the underlying entry will be kept around until all existing handles to it have been released.
Note that there are cases where this function returns true but tvDecRefWillRelease() will return false.
Note that there are certain constructs that can appear in types which the scanner generator cannot handle automatically.
Note that there is a conflict between different definitions that / produce the same Objective-C method.
Note that these all compare equal (using the Is() method).
Note that these types imply the arrays are non-empty.
Note that this / excludes ObjC class metatypes, which may need to be wrapped or unwrapped / when converting from native representation to AnyObject representation.
Note that this ReadTier currently only supports Get and MultiGet and does not support iterators.
Note that this class is never destructed, so don't add complex members.
Note that this conformance entry was superseded by the given / entry.
Note that this does / *not* handle the metadata template stuff.
Note that this does not directly affect LastStackPointer().
Note that this doesn't help with tapping on a touchable element that is being scrolled, unless you can call cancelTouches exactly between "touches began" and "touches ended" events.
Note that this explicitly excludes allocations that are made through the big alloc API.
Note that this fix cannot rely on value_type being defined as many user-defined container types don't have value_type.
Note that this function always returns false for non-refcounted types.
Note that this function does not have access to the actual value, nor does it do any run time resolution on the annotation's class name.
Note that this function is not supported in RocksDBLite.
Note that this function must be implemented in a way such that it should not run for an extended period of time before the function returns.
Note that this function will return TBottom for TUninit.
Note that this includes lr.
Note that this includes private properties in both cases.
Note that this includes unique stubs like fcallHelperThunk, which are reached by PHP function call.
Note that this is NOT testing existence, but reading a boolean value.
Note that this is a memberwise initializer and thus the body will be / generated by SILGen.
Note that this is different than getting a boolean value.
Note that this is kept in Swift because it's really only useful in C++11, and there aren't any major open-source subprojects of LLVM that can use C++11 yet.
Note that this is not equal to the number of outstanding weak pointers.
Note that this is not* the function whose body the NI belongs to.
Note that this is only a simplified model and not correct in all cases.
Note that this is only an estimate, because we will include fragmentation on the ends of slabs or due to alignment.
Note that this may be an abstract class that did not provide an implementation.
Note that this may differ from m_funcVecLen, since numMethods() is the exact number of methods, and m_funcVecLen is only required to be an upper bound.
Note that this may differ significantly from the / type of l-value.
Note that this may include types that the property itself cannot actually contain, due to the effects of a possible __get function.
Note that this means IndirectFixups will not work for C++ code paths that need to do a fixup without making at least one other C++ call, but for the current use case this is fine.
Note that this notification won't fire when debugging in Chrome.
Note that this number will be round up to the smallest multiple of 128 that is no less than the specified size.
Note that this offset is relative to the current instruction.
Note that this potential archetype was renamed (due to typo / correction), providing the new name.
Note that this type representation describes an invalid type.
Note that this value is only a hint, and not an indicator of the total memory used by the app.
Note that this will also clobber the Aux area of a TypedValueAux.
Note that this will gather the methods the first time it is called and then memoize the results.
Note that this will init both the queue and the module itself if they have not already been created.
Note that this will init the instance if it has not already been created.
Note that this will init the module if it has not already been created.
Note that those types do exist, just with less ridiculous names: TGen and TPtrToGen, respectively.
Note that trapping SEH exceptions is not implemented here.
Note that unlike all of the preceding methods, this method is not abstract and therefore clients should not override it.
Note that we do not support recognizing that an accelerator has been registered by another application on all platforms.
Note that we don't have setters.
Note that we don't put closure locals here because they are per-instance.
Note that we don't track the sizes of stubs anywhere---this code only works because all service requests emit a code segment of size svcreq::stub_size().
Note that we end up here if we pass a weak ref that refers to a collected object.
Note that we have added a member into the iterable declaration context, / so that it can also be added to the lookup table (if needed).
Note that we have added a member into the iterable declaration context.
Note that we have already type-checked the inheritance clause.
Note that we have attempted to
Note that we have to check again immediately after acquiring the lock to prevent a race.
Note that we have to update the LRU list before we increment m_size, so that other threads don't attempt to evict list items before they even exist.
Note that we intentionally don't std::forward 'args'.
Note that we intentionally use size_t for size class index here, so that gcc would not generate inefficient code.
Note that we look for both C::iterator and C::const_iterator.
Note that we make get and set access to ThreadStatusData lockless.
Note that we reverse the winding of the input triangle.
Note that we will have at most one active call to handleResume() in each VM nesting level, which is why this is just a single pointer.
Note that we've preserved vmStack.top(), and vmFirstAR was invalid prior to the popVMState above.
Note that when a function is invoked by the runtime via invokeFunc(), the "pre-live" state is skipped and the ActRec is materialized in the "live" state.
Note that when a static or uncounted string is in a TypedValue, it may or may not have KindOfPersistentString.
Note that when suspending, RegisterAccelerator/UnregisterAccelerator/UnregisterAccelerators are not allowed to be called until shortcut handling has been resumed.
Note that when this notification is sent, ExtensionService has already removed the extension from its internal state.
Note that when type conversions occur, pointers returned by prior calls to sqlite3_column_blob(), sqlite3_column_text(), and/or sqlite3_column_text16() may be invalidated.
Note that write_buffer_size is enforced per column family.
Note the below two do not set errno because they are used only here in this file on a Windows handle and, therefore, not necessary.
Note the start of the field offset vector.
Note the string may not be null terminated.
Note these are different than those copying constructors that also take one value.
Note these must be destroyed after thread_value since its destructor accesses them.
Note things that happened.
Note this functions returns a local reference, / which means that it must not be stored in a static variable.
Note this functions returns an alias_ref that / points to a leaked global reference.
Note this is a non-blocking call and it will return immediately.
Note this is a non-blocking call.
Note though, we do not care about exact API compatibility with the kernel, and in fact the kernel often does not have a single API that works across architectures.
Note to maintainers: insert code like the following in future NumPy versions.
Note types used in executables
Note we can't use gfx::Size::IsEmpty as it returns true if either width or height is zero.
Note we cannot change the size_ of the current payload, as all values are packed.
Note, all these functions will create a new array than modifying input, although names of these functions sound like mutating.
Note, all these functions will create a new string than modifying input, although names of these functions sound like mutating.
Note, alloc is not considered /        to have side effects because its result/users represent /        its effect.
Note, despite the name, this can never return a non-Cell.
Note, read http://www.php.net/substr about meanings of negative start or length.
Note, the returned class may or may not be *defined* at the program point you care about (it could be non-hoistable, even though it's unique, for example).
Note, the returned function may or may not be defined at the program point (it could require a function autoload that might fail).
Note, this does not feel space with zeros in case the file is extended.
Note, this is disabled by default because of the need to have an intersection operation in the type system to maintain index invariants---it doesn't quite work yet.
Note, this is safe since result_ is a vector (guaranteed contiguous)
Note, we / do not require the function type attributes to match.
Note:  An InvalidArgument status will be returned if there are any Merge operators for this key.
Note:  Many of the methods in this class have comments indicating that external synchromization is required as these methods are not thread-safe.
Note:  You should not write or delete anything from the batch directly and should only use the functions in the Transaction class to write to this transaction.
Note: 'Array' is declared 'id' instead of 'NSArray' to avoid automatic bridging to 'Swift.Array' when this API is imported to Swift.
Note: 'Dictionary' is declared 'id' instead of 'NSDictionary' to avoid automatic bridging to 'Swift.Dictionary' when this API is imported to Swift.
Note: Because we are using the sign bit for testing pinnedness it is important to do a signed comparison below.
Note: Bottom is a type with no value, and Uninit/InitNull/Nullptr are considered types with a single unique value, so this function returns false for those types.
Note: Currently, this function will return Status::MergeInProgress if the most recent write to the queried key in this batch is a Merge.
Note: Equivalently iterable macro requires one of arr1 or arr2 be trivially iterable to be valid.
Note: ErrorIterator with Status::Incomplete shall be returned if all the following conditions are met: 1.
Note: For boxed values, this will generate a LdRef instruction which takes the given exit trace in case the inner type doesn't match the tracked type for this local.
Note: For now, we are not `ini_get()` enabling these type of options as it is not trivial to come up with a non-hacky and workable way to store the data correctly.
Note: If changing this number, update native-func-caller.h using make_native-func-caller.php
Note: If you add new supported type tests, you should update negativeCheckType() to indicate whether it is precise or not.
Note: If you are using a TransactionDB, it is not recommended to implement FilterMergeOperand().
Note: If you want to see whether the set has exactly 0 or 1 element, use `empty()' or `hasSingleValue()' instead.
Note: In autosize mode, the container element may not match the size of the guest.
Note: Kinda unsigned overflow, but behaves differently on various cpus.
Note: NaN check is always performed.
Note: Not thread-safe.
Note: Returns E_NOTFOUND if variable does not exist.
Note: SLJIT_SDIV is single precision divide.
Note: SLJIT_UNUSED as destination is not valid for floating point operations, since they cannot be used for setting flags.
Note: The base field is aligned to PAGE_SIZE bytes (usually 4k or more).
Note: This file contains experimental APIs.
Note: This flag cannot be combined with any other SLJIT_SET_* flag.
Note: This method is disabled on MacOS X 10.7 and iOS version 5.0 and will always return SQLITE_MISUSE.
Note: This number must be a power of 2, if not it will be sanitized to be the next lowest power of 2, for example a value of 7 will be treated as 4, a value of 19 will be treated as 16.
Note: To do prefix seek/scan in `UserCollectedProperties`, you can do something similar to:
Note: To emphasize that registers assigned to R2-R4 are saved registers, they are enclosed by square brackets.
Note: Use StrFree() to release psczOut.
Note: Use StrFree() to release psczValue.
Note: Variant is making unnecessary KindOfUninit checks here.
Note: We are relying on Clang nodes to be at least 4-byte aligned.
Note: We can't use llvm::TrailingObjects here because the trailing object type is opaque.
Note: You should always return a new instance for each call, rather than returning the same instance each time the bridge is reloaded.
Note: You should use MatchesScheme() instead of this getter unless you absolutely need the exact scheme.
Note: a key object must be followed by a value object.
Note: all 0-d arrays are C_CONTIGUOUS and F_CONTIGUOUS.
Note: although sljit_emit_fast_return could be replaced by an ijump, it is not suggested, since many architectures do clever branch prediction on call / return instruction pairs.
Note: assuming bc::Nop is empty and has trivial dtor/ctor.
Note: auto is only a valid value for alignSelf.
Note: be careful when using this.
Note: blocks in fault funclets will have factored edges to the blocks listed as handlers in any ExnNode that contained the fault-protected region, since those control flow paths are possible.
Note: cobbled from the linux header file, with modifications
Note: could be 32-bit
Note: creating an FbsonDocument (through createDocument) does not allocate any memory.
Note: dst is the left and src is the right operand for SLJIT_CMPD.
Note: every call of sljit_emit_enter and sljit_set_context overwrites the previous context.
Note: expiration, creation, and modification times are stored unsigned in 32-bits as seconds since the Epoch to save cache-line space.
Note: flags are not changed (unlike sljit_emit_enter / sljit_emit_return).
Note: if SLJIT_R1 is -1 and SLJIT_R0 is integer min (0x800..00), the behaviour is undefined.
Note: if SLJIT_R1 is 0, the behaviour is undefined.
Note: if either operand is NaN, the behaviour is undefined for types up to SLJIT_S_LESS_EQUAL.
Note: in non-NDEBUG builds, tracks the context of each primary / archetype type, which can be very useful for debugging.
Note: it is an FORWARD iterator only due to the design of FBSON format.
Note: it is fine to continue to reuse one AliasAnalysis structure after mutating the IR, because the information it contains is both flow-insensitive and conservative.
Note: it returns with -1 for virtual registers (only on x86-32).
Note: it's unclear what's "vm" about this, and why it's not just resolve_include.
Note: iterators are forward direction only.
Note: keys will not be "de-duplicated".
Note: limit and max_limit contains the size for stack allocation.
Note: m_maybeRefReturn used to implement an optimization to avoid unbox checks when we call functions where we know no function with that name returns by reference.
Note: modifying Z_OBJPROP(z) with zend_hash_update() etc.
Note: non-const iteration is not allowed, since we don't want to allocate a map on accident.
Note: on x86-32, R3 - R6 (same as S3 - S6) are emulated (they are allocated on the stack).
Note: on x86-32, S3 - S6 (same as R3 - R6) are emulated (they are allocated on the stack).
Note: only for sljit specific, non ABI compilant calls.
Note: please do not add new code that assumes the range does include a null-terminator if possible.
Note: please do not introduce new uses of this API that write nulls 1 byte past slice.len---we want to weed those out.
Note: removing statistics doesn't effect speed
Note: requires exclusive access to the underlying AST.
Note: result is possibly larger than the real union when it has upper range.
Note: s_pageSize is a dynamically initialized static, so do not create global ReadOnlyArenas.
Note: see sljit_create_compiler for the explanation of allocator_data.
Note: since every set has a unique representation, this can be used for hashing.
Note: size() returns a signed int for historical reasons.
Note: sljit tries to emit the minimum number of instructions.
Note: sljit_emit_enter and sljit_set_context defines whether a register is S or R register.
Note: stack growing should not happen in small steps: 4k, 16k or even bigger growth is better.
Note: the current name of this module/function is historical.
Note: the function passed here escapes (naturally).
Note: the index is always an even number on ARM (except ARM-64), MIPS, and SPARC.
Note: the order of values is important.
Note: the returned function may or may not be defined at the program point (it could require a function autoload that might fail).
Note: the returned integer is *not* an rds::Handle.
Note: the sparse part of m_mem is deliberately uninitialized, but we do it for valgrind or asan builds.
Note: the top field is initialized to base.
Note: the what() method of this class is not thread-safe (t6900503).
Note: there is code that packs this enum in a 2-bit bitfield.
Note: these IDs are only valid for the duration of the process.
Note: these functions for managing 1GB huge pages are not designed to be thread-safe.
Note: this function returns true on array types without checking every element.
Note: this is potentially pessimistic for its use in ActRec state merging right now, but not incorrect.
Note: this may not work properly with LTO.
Note: this structure may not be supported by all operating systems.
Note: this test can not be short-circuited, since we need to advance through the entire curve no matter what
Note: vasm opcodes need only 2 lanes (64b each)
Note: we deliberately don't call this PrintTo(), as that name conflicts with ::testing::internal::PrintTo in the body of the function.
Note: we don't have to do this for function which are recomputed.
Note: we might use more memory than memtable_memory_budget during high write rate period
Note: you're generally not going to want to copy-construct the return value of this function.
Note: zend_object_handlers will be an opaque (incomplete) type for callers external to EZC
Note:- Currently only Content and Chrome define and use notifications.
Notes the beginning of the field offset vector for a particular ancestor / of a generic-layout class.
Notes the end of the field offset vector for a particular ancestor / of a generic-layout class.
Notes used in ET_CORE
Notes:  - Unlike std::vector, storage is not guaranteed to be contiguous.
Notes: - you cannot postpone conditional jump instructions except if noted that the instruction does not set flags (See: SLJIT_KEEP_FLAGS).
Notes: It is expected the BA may call IBurnCore::SetLocalSource() or IBurnCore::SetDownloadSource() to update the source location before returning IDRETRY or IDDOWNLOAD.
Notes: The generated sequences never include end.

Notice extracted from xxHash homepage : xxHash is an extremely fast Hash algorithm, running at RAM speed limits.
Notice that multiple back-edges sharing the same target (header) block are thus part of the same loop.
Notice that some of those masks overlap instruction type so the table must be ordered in a way that return the correct instruction because the decoder will return the first exact match.
Notice that the more / difficult feature of removing links is not supported.
Notice that web_contents_ must be placed after dialog_manager_, so we can make sure web_contents_ is destroyed before dialog_manager_, otherwise a crash would happen.

PC-relative address encoding.
PCRE client programs can override this by selecting other values at run time.
PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.
PCRE is able to support several different kinds of newline (CR, LF, CRLF, "any" and "anycrlf" at present).
PCRE is compiled as an 8 bit library if it is not requested otherwise.
PCRE is written in Standard C, but there are a few non-standard things it can cope with, allowing it to run on SunOS4 and other "close to standard" systems.
PCRE keeps offsets in its compiled code as 2-byte quantities (always stored in big-endian order) by default.
PCRE must be compiled with the -DVPCOMPAT option on the command line.
PCRE uses recursive function calls to handle backtracking while matching.
PCRE uses some other 2-byte quantities that do not change when the size of offsets changes.

SYNONYM SUPPORT  Custom tokenizers may also support synonyms.
SYS_ERRNO should be an l-value.
SYS_ERRNO: All system calls will update "errno" unless overriden by setting the SYS_ERRNO macro prior to including this file.
SYS_INLINE: New symbols will be defined "static inline", unless overridden by the SYS_INLINE macro.
SYS_LINUX_SYSCALL_SUPPORT_H This macro is used to avoid multiple inclusions of this header file.
SYS_PREFIX: New system calls will have a prefix of "sys_" unless overridden by the SYS_PREFIX macro.
SYS_SYSCALL_ENTRYPOINT: Some applications (such as sandboxes that filter system calls), need to be able to run custom-code each time a system call is made.
Sadly it seems the STL does not have such a predicate that is non-constructive in the algorithm library, so we implement it ourselves.

Since MakeAndRegisterTestInfo receives ownership of test factory pointer, same factory object cannot be passed into that method twice.
Since RegularLocations represent the majority / of locations, this greatly simplifies the user code.
Since Secret is a secret and incomplete type, the only expression a user can write that has type Secret* is a null pointer literal.

Since core members of the Google Test project don't have access to other platforms, support for them may be less stable.
Since file numbers grow monotonically, this also means that pending_outputs_ is always sorted.
Since fpOff is given as an offset from the frame pointer as if it were in the normal place on the main stack, we have to reconstruct that "normal place".
Since it fills "*desc" with the up-to-date information, this call might internally lock and release DB mutex to access the up-to-date CF options.
Since it is an analysis it does not modify the IR in anyway.
Since it is more specific than the generic ones in ::testing::internal, it will be picked by the compiler in the following statement - exactly what we want.

Since it is unconstrained, it has predicates to test whether `rn' is a GPR, XMM, or virtual register.
Since it's going into an ordered map...
Since making a service request leaves the TC, we need to sync the current `spOff' to vmsp.
Since many statement journals never become large, setting the spill threshold to a value such as 64KiB can greatly reduce the amount of I/O required to support statement rollback.
Since mem.c manages its own memory, we need to explicitly specify alignment in qh_meminitbuffers().
Since rTmp cannot be a destination, it cannot be in a copy-cycle, so its value will be read before we deal with cycles.
Since some compilers define these standard functions as macros, the wrapper cannot have the same name as the wrapped function.
Since std::runtime_error inherits from std::exception, many testing frameworks know how to extract and print the message inside it.

Since the class is used for creating very simple demo-applications we don't need very rich possibilities here, just basic ones.
Since the demo applications cannot rely on any platform/library specific stuff it's impossible to include SDL.h into the application files.

Since this is handled as a fatal error by SQLite, vfs implementations should endeavor to prevent this by setting mxPathname to a sufficiently large value.
Since this is often used as a static global, we want to do anything that might try to access ThreadInfo::s_threadInfo here instead of in the constructor.
Since void doesn't actually store anything, we can save some memory by using a single static instance of the void type.
Since we are inside a derived class template, C++ requires use to visit the members of FooTest via 'this'.
Since we do not know anything here the only we can have is just a pointer to this class as a data member.
Since we don't ever use the two at the same time, it is okay to use a union.
Since we don't have GtkWindows anymore, we need to interface directly with the lower level libdbusmenu-glib, which we opportunistically dlopen() since not everyone is running Ubuntu.
Since we don't use any of the pointer types, the compiler cannot use type aliasing assumptions to miscompile.
Since we don't want to patch Chromium, we just pretend to be Content Shell.
Since we iterate in insertion order, it might be convenient to ask what's at the front or the back.
Since we know that our array is sorted and uniqued, Ptr must be that element.
Since we know that our sorted arrays are uniqued, we can use set_union to get the uniqued sorted array that we want.
Since we rolled back the  interpolators, the color values may have overflow.
Since we use a serial file queue `RKFileQueue`, reading/writing from multiple threads should be perceived as being atomic, unless someone bypasses the `RCTAsyncLocalStorage` API.
Since we want the debug info to survive, we do not remap the location here.
Since we're rolling our own anyway, fix ffs's wacky offset-by-one historical implementation.

Snapshots before the delete might not see the data in the given range.
So / we can only reap the cleanup stack up to the innermost depth / that we've handed out as a Scope.
So I try an explanation: if one experimentally tests all multipliers between 1 and 256 (as RSE did now) one detects that even numbers are not useable at all.
So N should be set to twice the expected maximum number of threads.
So PHP would crash by allowing the call.
So a disable must be attached to a stack depth.
So a function that sets up a stack frame at all uses as least FIXED_FRAME bytes of stack.
So also unclear where it was introduced*.
So callers should make a copy when needed.
So far, only certain string properties take an argument.
So following definition is required to use select_large_fdset.
So for example, if "samplelib" cannot be loaded, then names like "samplelib.so" or "samplelib.dylib" or "samplelib.dll" might be tried also.
So if S1 and S2 are the same set, their pointers must also be the same set.
So if speed is of utmost importance, it makes sense to disable the mutexes.
So if that is a possibility for your workload, ConcurrentScalableCache is recommended instead.
So if this method returns false, it is because client specified bad data or there was internal corruption.
So if we don't need to return one, we can just stop here.
So if we have a parent, we cannot be root.
So in the case that the helper throws an exception, the unwinder will believe it has to decref three normal stack slots (where the pre-live ActRec is).
So it depends on register pressure of the call site.
So keys().back() was the first key seen by iterator.
So on 32-bit systems we use absolute addresses for jump targets and constants, but on 64-bit systems realtive 32-bit offsets
So please use this version only if you are sure the call is safe.
So that BaseMap can call intLikeStrKeys on a HashCollection
So that tests can avoid clobbering the config file
So that when a  document such as "I won first place" is tokenized, entries are added to the FTS index for "i", "won", "first", "1st" and "place".
So that, if you replace these new/delete to malloc/free make sure that the in-place new is called and take care of calling the destructor too.
So that, we render the beginning part with checking  for overflow.
So the following line has been commented-out to accommodate.
So the longest string that can be completely written will be n-1 characters.
So the new function is not good for anything by itself.
So the redefinition macros are only valid if the SQLITE_CORE macros is undefined.
So the transaction log (if enabled) will still contain (key, delta_value).
So they will not work if admin server is not present, or if the new server and old server disagree on port and password for admin server.
So this is nonzero if and only if there any bits set other than an arbitrarily long sequence of low bits.
So this macro should be used to mark at least one function that is referenced, and other functions that are not referenced in the same file.
So this needs to happen from the UI thread on these systems.
So trigger an assert in debug builds, and cap it in opt builds.
So unless you want to provide own a different output stream type, use FbsonJsonParser object.
So unless you want to provide own a different output stream type, use FbsonParser object.
So we distinguish between functions and variables.
So we don't change existing definitions of PCRE_EXP_DECL and PCRECPP_EXP_DECL.
So we encode each as a 16-bit difference.
So we have a type, name, and possibly associated local for the base's container.
So we know when we can delete the value      .
So we place it in the global systemlib and bind its dependencies early.
So we return a conservative false in this case.
So we use __thread on gcc, icc and clang, unless we are on OSX.
So we wait until onParse is called for the class, and it calls onParseRecur for its children.
So we will just evict one extra element per insert() until the overfill is rectified.
So where to register is intuitive, omitted.
So, for example, a base with BaseLoc::Frame could be located inside of a Ref that is pointed to by the Frame.
So, for now, we go with "import".
So, instead of storing pointers we / map pointers to indices and store the indices.
So, it needs to be possible for different types of linked_ptr to participate in the same circular linked list, so we need a single class type here.
So, we just have to redefine all fo the _syscallX() macros.
So, we just have to redefine all of the _syscallX() macros.
So, we need to hard-code the system call number.
So, we'll leave the padding in here, until we find a better solution.
So, when we detect that case we must use the safe, slow workaround.
So, when you call start_new_path() you need to store its return value somewhere else to navigate to the path afterwards.

The reason for the shared object and loading at start-up is due to build system limitations.
The reason for this overload is that streaming a NULL pointer to ostream is undefined behavior.
The reason is that C++ injects the name of a class as a member of the class itself (e.g. you can refer to class iterator as either 'iterator' or 'iterator::iterator').
The reason is that c++ destruction order of static variables in the reverse order of their construction order.
The reason is that it is only non-null when the transaction is blocked in the TransactionLockMgr::AcquireWithTimeout function.
The reason is to have the result absolutely conststent with what the scanline rasterizer produces.
The reason it must still count its parameter locals is that the caller may or may not pass any of the parameters, regardless of how many are declared.
The reason ranges extend downward is that it is common to need to refer to the class of all stack locations below some depth (this can be done by putting INT32_MAX in the size).
The reason that this is a function that returns "this" instead of a constructor is to enable chaining of multiple similar calls in the future.

The reason why we do this is to make sure we / have access to the original argument's state if we modify the argument / when optimizing.
The reason why we use an Index instead of a / pointer is that the SmallVector that we use to store these can reallocate / invalidating our pointers.

Therefore all the compilers we care about are adequate for supporting value-parameterized tests.
Therefore for our purposes, an object type's "name" includes its linkage, as that's needed to infer object type equality.
Therefore it doesn't need to be used otherwise.

Therefore, we only allow reserve() to make room for up to MaxSize / 2 elements.
Therefore, we want all writes to it to be seen atomically.
Therefore, when SLJIT_INT_OP is specified, all register arguments must be the result of other operations with the same SLJIT_INT_OP flag.

This is done so we do not have to represent the RPO / numbers in a separate array.
This is done to conserve memory if a particular thread is unlikely to need to serve another PHP request for a while.
This is efficient because it columns these two common use cases: (1) hash index only identify one location, we read the key to verify the location, and read key and value if it is the right location.
This is either a fixed bit / width or an abstract target-dependent value such as "size of a pointer".

Ways in which an object can be referenced.
Ways in which an object can fit into a fixed-size buffer.
We / do not support loops with multiple loop latches and instead rely on loops / to be canonicalized to have one back edge.
We WILL change the `char *' entries, so make sure that you allocate a separate buffer for them and that you free them after sapi_deactivate().
We achieve this by overwriting the ActRec cells with nulls.
We add a new format of filter block called full filter block This new interface gives you more space of customization
We add support for unbuffered I/O on windows as well we utilize the original buffer as an alignment buffer to write directly to file with no buffering.
We admit that this is a goofy design.
We allocate a unique 32-bit ID to almost all Funcs.
We allow the buffer to grow until it's size hits the limit.
We allow the buffer to grow until the specified value and then for bigger requests allocate one shot buffers.
We already know that 'expected' is a null pointer.
We already subst so getOpConformance is not needed.
We also clone methods from traits when we transclude the trait in its user Classes in repo mode.
We also count the number of unique elements for allocation purposes.
We also define the EXPECT_* variations.
We also must clear the low bit so that we can memcpy this one element into the newly allocated block of memory.
We also need to track effects of intermediate dims on the type of the base.
We also pack bits into the key---the low bit is set if the function is a magic call (in which case the cached Func* is, and the second lowest bit is set if the cached Func has AttrStatic.
We also provide some convenient wrappers:
We also share these layouts from the decls block.
We always use the pointer's width as its swift ABI alignment.
We are asked to wait till we have buffers available
We are asserting to make sure that is the case
We are building this library
We are checking for release.
We are checking for retain.
We are implementing this ourselves rather than using the C stdlib so that the seed state is not shared with other third-party code.
We are not going to structure directories this way at all, but we will have PlainFile, ZipFile and Socket derive from this base class, so they can share some minimal functionalities.
We are not handling overloaded classes right now
We are on Windows CE, which has no environment variables.
We are only supporting UTF-8 and ISO-8859-1 encoding.
We are using this library
We are visiting the node's left subtree.
We assume L* and R* don't alias, so we don't need to check type tags when comparing.
We assume that / Start and End are both in the same basic block.
We assume that I is an instruction in the block.
We assume that S2 is sorted and uniqued.
We assume that Start and End / are both in the same basic block.
We assume that Start and End are both in the / same basic block.
We assume that cold block take very long to execute.
We assume that the Clang type might provide additional structure.
We assume that these are accurate.
We assume that we will only this in one place so no reference counting is necessary.
We break profiling blocks after any instruction that can side exit, including instructions with predicted output, and before any control flow merge point.
We cache the last search to accelerate code that / searches the same value in a loop.
We call OutputCharacter() to filter out such false-positive characters.
We call dump() on the object instead of using dumpNode here so that the former will be available in a debug build as long as something in the program calls dump on the collection.
We can access the isa of pure Swift heap objects directly.
We can assume that the pinned flag isn't set unless the refcount is nonzero, and or'ing it in gives us a more efficient mask: the check just becomes "is newval nonzero".
We can burn these into the TC even when classes are not persistent, since only a single name-to-class mapping will exist per request.
We can burn these into the TC even when functions are not persistent, since only a single name-to-function mapping will exist per request.
We can construct the set directly from 0 or 1 integer, or a range of integers.
We can convert later to remove them
We can create an AStack from either a stack pointer or a frame pointer.
We can do this as we are playing the role of a standard library vendor.
We can emit a single conditional branch.
We can emit an unconditional branch.
We can emit an unreachable and go about our business.
We can fall out here if the value wasn't actually a valid MetadataKind.
We can flip the typedef if/when the LLVM interface supports LLVM containers.
We can get a SHORT by making USHORT signed.
We can give these reasonable default implementations.
We can give this a reasonable default implementation.
We can make the instruction now.
We can only use C99 formats for npy_int_p if it is the same as intp_t, hence the condition on HAVE_UNITPTR_T
We can statically determine the presence of extra inhabitants for fixed / types.
We can still insert if there's space.
We can toggle these values, but they need sum to 128 so that RegSet can fit into two registers.
We can't (easily) remove items from m_expQueue, so if we add a new entry every time an item is updated we could end up with a lot of copies of the same key in the queue.
We can't avoid the refcounting when it's a ref.
We can't batch gradient painting in CoreGraphics, so those will return NO and paint gets called instead.
We can't be universally fixed size if we're not locally fixed size.
We can't cast pointers directly because those are 32 bits, and gcc will dump ugly warnings about casting from a pointer to an integer of a different size.
We can't copy them around.
We can't have SSATmps spanning php-level calls, except for frame pointers and constant values.
We can't just / forward-declare their PointerLikeTypeTraits because we don't own / the types.
We can't just disable the breakpoint until we leave the site because some opcode in the site could recurse to the site.
We can't just eagerly scan the pointer as a T here because it might be actually be pointing to something derived from T.
We can't officially use ESC_t because it is a POSIX reserved identifier (presumably because of all the others like size_t).
We can't put an ifdef inside the typedef because pcretest needs access to the struct of the 8-, 16- and 32-bit variants.
We can't scan the whole cache and remove all of the occurrences of the pointer.
We cannot call PrintTo(*it, os) here as PrintTo() doesn't handle *it being a native array.
We cannot determine these outside the compilation (e.g. by running a program as part of "configure") because PCRE is often cross-compiled for use on other systems.
We cannot have both these things, so we currently use the "little-endian" representation and avoid any multi-byte operations that depend on byte order.
We cannot inline/clone debug intrinsics without a scope.
We cannot name this class MutexLock because the ctor declaration would conflict with a macro named MutexLock, which is defined on some platforms.
We cannot optimize the argument.
We cannot rely on numeric_limits in STL, as __int64 and long long are not part of standard C++ and numeric_limits doesn't need to be defined for them.
We cannot simply use From(), as the type From may not have a public default constructor.
We cannot use UniversalPrint(value.first, os) here, as T1 may be a reference type.
We chain new translations onto the end of the list, so we need to track all the fallback jumps from the "tail" translation so we can rewrire them to new ones.
We check if the next opcode is DO_FCALL in case EXT instructions are used.
We chose it to be a subset of both PCRE and POSIX extended regex, so it's easy to learn wherever you come from.
We chose to split the implementation into two classes linked via a reference counted/raw pointers.
We clone the toplevel pseudomain for each context class and cache the results in m_pseudoMainCache.
We compute and store 'stack offsets' in many different places in the jit, and there are a number of different frames of reference for these offsets.
We could continue to evict in a loop, but if there are a lot of threads here at the same time, that could lead to spinning.
We could use three low bits on 64-bit, and maybe some high bits as well.
We currently have three versions: 0 -- This version is currently written out by all RocksDB's versions by default.
We currently only support x86-32, x86-64, ARM, MIPS, and PPC on Linux.
We currently provide no / supported mechanism for making a non-artificial subclass / dynamically.
We declare (but don't implement) this to prevent the compiler from implementing the assignment operator.
We default to null_array since serialization is not limited inside the VM.
We define SUPPORT_UTF if SUPPORT_UTF8 is enabled for compatibility reasons with existing code.
We define UniversalPrinter as a class template (as opposed to a function template), as we need to partially specialize it for reference types, which cannot be done with function templates.
We define a "pointer" to be an address-type / value, an object reference or any value-type (struct, enum, etc.) which / contains a reference.
We define accessors (below) to encapsulate this logic.
We define it as a different type / (instead of as a typedef) just to remove the "getFromPointer" methods and / enforce purity in the Swift codebase.
We define our own KERNEL_NSIG to deal with this.
We define them anyway since we are too lazy to differentiate the architecture.

We define two overloaded versions of Compare().
We definitely do not need to deallocate.
We delay validation of C and Objective-C type-bridging functions in the standard library until we encounter a declaration that requires one.
We deliberately allow #2 to be a candidate, as sometimes it's impossible to define #1 (e.g. when foo is ::std, defining anything in it is undefined behavior unless you are a compiler vendor.).
We deliberately pick an unusual name for this internal method to avoid clashing with names used in user TESTs.
We derive it from std::runtime_error, which is for errors presumably detectable only at run time.
We did not have any overlapping intersection.
We didn't want to be backwards incompatible so we didn't change the return status (this is a public API).
We disallow copying TestCases.
We disallow copying TestEventListeners.
We disallow copying TestResult.
We disallow copying Tests.
We disallow copying UnitTest.
We distinguish between which of these the importer chose by the deprecation message.
We do NOT use the volatile return trick since _controlfp is a function call and thus FP registers are saved in memory anyway.
We do NOT use the volatile return trick since _controlfp_s is a function call and thus FP registers are saved in memory anyway.
We do an ordinary get and return Status::OK()
We do not anticipate changes to experimental interfaces but reserve the right to make minor changes if experience from use "in the wild" suggest such changes are prudent.

We do not support any special encoding schemes in LongFixedLengthColBufEncoder.
We do not support both EBCDIC and UTF-8/16/32 at the same time.
We do not support symbolic projections yet.
We do not use kLIBC's langinfo.
We do not want to visit callee functions if we just have a value base.
We do this because of unfortunateness in SILGen, / some expressions (e.g. OpenExistentialExpr) cannot be multiply emitted in a / composable way.
We do two special-case optimizations to partially inline 'singleton' accessor functions (functions that just return a static local or static property if it's not null).
We don't always statically know what function to call from a given callsite.
We don't attempt to track their types.
We don't bother erasing `name' from any name lists---since it will not correspond to any NameData, it will be skipped during finalization anyway.
We don't care about these by themselves for witnesses.
We don't count mutex_ as the cache's internal state so semantically we don't mind mutex_ invoking the non-const actions.
We don't currently enforce that rule, but will start behaving badly.
We don't currently support any higher- order alignment restrictions.
We don't distinguish between our representations for direct calls to free functions and those to member functions, with the assumption that they have the same calling convention.
We don't have a lock-free algorithm for updating prev_, but we do have the option of invalidating the entire sequential-insertion cache.
We don't have libdwarf, so stub it out.
We don't have movzbq because it behaves exactly the same as movzbl but takes an extra byte.
We don't have to write KindOfUninit here, because a debug_backtrace wouldn't be able to see these slots (they are stack cells).
We don't hold the refcount here, since default column family always exists We are also not responsible for cleaning up default_cfd_cache_.
We don't know for sure what's live.
We don't know what lies ahead.
We don't know what lies behind.
We don't mark it as const here, as doing so will cause a warning in the constructor of UnitTest.

We don't need to guard objects for rbx, so let's do nothing at all.
We don't need to read/scan the whole FBSON packed bytes in order to return results.
We don't need to save the value in this case since we assume that the subject must be one of the case values.
We don't need to track which condition code a conditional jump used because we take care to smash only the address and leave the code intact.
We don't protect writing to has_owner_ here, as it's the caller's responsibility to ensure that the current thread holds the mutex when this is called.
We don't recount here if there are still older updates invalidated by the tombstones.
We don't support MSVC 7.1 with exceptions disabled now.
We don't support locals being type Gen, so if we ever get into such a case, we need to punt.
We don't track this information for local ids past kMaxTrackedLocals, which are assumed to always be in this set.
We don't use 'enum class' because we want the enumerators to convert freely to uint64_t.
We don't use CreateFunctionTemplate here because it creates a new FunctionTemplate everytime, which is cached by V8 and causes leaks.
We don't want to put nops in Vunits representing stubs, and those Vunits don't have a context set.
We enabled table_options.cache_index_and_filter_blocks.
We ensure that the m_expMap entry is removed before the apc key is freed, and guarantee that the key is valid as a char* if it exists in m_expMap.
We expect our users to sort/unique the input array.
We expect this to be quite small for most protocols.
We expect to see a lot of entries for keys like: ab abcdef abcdefg abcdefh corresponding to closely-related paths and different prefixes of the same path.
We fail if `canStartBlock(block)' is false.
We first try to schedule compactions based on `base_background_compactions`.
We flag a bit in ah, ch, dh, bh so byteRegNeedsRex doesn't trigger.
We flush the mapping view in page_size increments.
We force 64bit-wide parameters onto the stack, then access each 32-bit component individually.
We found the end of the chain.

We get a little frisky with the third vertex in the triangle.
We get around that problem by using a modified PC2 which retains the 8 otherwise-lost bits in the unused low-order bits of each byte.
We got an item to evict, erase from the bucket
We got woken up by somebody calling notify (as opposed to timeout), then some work might be on the queue.
We handle conditional and unconditional jumps, as well as pointers to code (via IncomingBranch::ADDR, used for example in a switch table).
We have a check in LoopRegionFunctionInfo::verify to make sure / that this stays true.
We have a matching ref count inst.
We have a pointer kind for each of the major segregated locations in which php values can live (eval stack, frame slots, properties, etc...).
We have a pointer to an error existential, which is always heap object.
We have a track record of self-deadlocking on these, and our pthread implementation tends to do crazy things when a rwlock is double-wlocked, so check and assert early in debug builds.
We have assertions that check that these interrupts stays server-side.
We have no callee-saved registers in php, and there'd be nowhere to spill these because all translations share the spill space.
We have no particular reason to destroy in either order.
We have not yet checked.
We have posixnv as an encapsulated object here so that we can use posix timers, posix threads, etc.
We have reasons for using distinct bitwise representations, though.
We have stepped out and will break on the next valid opcode.
We have the next fields blocked into qword-size unions so StringData initialization can do fewer stores to initialize the fields.
We have to keep at least one extra slot free so that we're guaranteed to eventually hit it when doing the hash lookup.
We have to manually implement move, because boost::dynamic_bitset doesn't support it (at the time of this writing).
We have to merge / them again.
We have to represent this as a member so we can list-initialize it.
We have to store an owner (a Swift declaration) instead of / directly referencing the original declaration due to current / limitations in the serializer.
We heap allocate a RefData when we make a reference to something.
We hold onto references to elements of this map.
We hold references to the Python objects, not just the underlying data arrays, so that Python reference counting can work.
We hook request start and finish to know when these events happen.
We ignore results at the top-level because we may have overloading that will be resolved properly by name binding.
We increment to the next op, so we are at the correct position when the generator is resumed.
We instead need to call the objc runtime to get the class.
We instead use the following macros.
We intentionally use a non-POD return type with these entry points to give them an indirect return ABI for compatibility with Swift.
We just updated the debug scope information.
We just want to avoid a redefinition error message.
We keep a cache per function.
We keep a linked list of destructors in ThreadLocalManager to be called on thread exit.
We keep a set of "factored edges" representing all possible early exits due to exceptional control flow.
We keep multiple of timeseries data at different granularity and update them simultaneously.
We know exactly there's only one cell, so, we don't have to call render_hline().
We know that all of our PtrSets are uniqued.
We know that both of our pointer sets are sorted, so we can essentially perform a sorted set merging algorithm to create the ID.
We know that we can only have one of each element in each list, so we can just visit I1 and continue.
We leave eight bits empty at the bottom so a type and sequence# can be packed together into 64-bits.
We like fast allocation.
We like fast destruction and do not want to have to iterate over / potentially many of these sets and invoke destructors.
We lookup/create the region for the innermost loop that contains the / block and add the block's region as a subregion of that loop.
We lose support for NULL detection where the compiler doesn't like passing non-POD classes through ellipsis (...).
We made the mistake of declaring macros starting with double underscore.
We maintain mappings from TCAs and TransIDs to translation information, for debugging purposes only.
We maintain the invariant that a Vector and its m_immCopy share the same ArrayData buffer.
We make a copy of the key in the list node, allowing us to find the TBB::CHM element from the list node.

We may have a tracked type even if we don't have an available value.
We may know the shape of an array without knowing whether it may have escalated or not.
We may not have a ldrefExit, but if so we better not be loading the inner ref.
We may run the interpreter collecting stats and when trace is on the amount of noise is unbearable.
We might be at tok::eof now, so ensure that consumeToken() does not assert about lexing past eof.
We mimic that on all platforms, though this makes us sad.
We modify the begin and end keys according to the range tombstones added to this file such that the read path does not miss range tombstones that cover gaps before/after/between files in a level.
We moved one forward, but index did not change
We must not have already had our sources initialized before this function is called.
We must put it before the C++ stuff, so that we don't misidentify Java as C++.

We must report iterators equal if they both point beyond their respective ranges.
We must still be in a single-threaded environment.
We need a separate field to passthrough custom kinds that originally came from the client, because we can't safely construct a UIdent for them.
We need a separate object to own the dbus channel to com.canonical.AppMenu.Registrar and to register/unregister the mapping between a XID and the DbusmenuServer instance we are offering.
We need all of our ViewControllers to cache layoutGuide changes so any View in our View hierarchy can access accurate layoutGuide info at any time.
We need more than mysql.h because we need CHARSET_INFO in one place.
We need that to ensure that the "-1 style" would go first.
We need the following helper functions only for their types.
We need the unwinder to ignore the half-built ActRec allocated on the stack and certainly to avoid attempting to decref its contents.

We need to convey the height to the Insert step, however, so that it can perform the proper links.
We need to explicitly cast to an unsigned 64 bit type to avoid implicit sign extension.

We need to skip both of the tombstone and updates hidden by the tombstones.

We only allow a very modest set of changes to a type.

We pass through eval'able php code and a string type constraint, only for exposure to reflection.

We purge items from it every n (configurable) apc_stores.
We push and pop as we deal with inlined calls.
We push and pop frames as we enter and leave inlined calls.
We put all the network addresses (which are simply strings of bits) in a trie that we can match against a candidate network address.
We put our data in a struct so that the size of the AssertHelper class can be as small as possible.

We should try moving them and see if it affects perf.
We shouldn't /     have to scan all the dominating points first.
We split NodeBase out so that we can just delegate to something that copies all the other fields.
We start slowing down writes at this point.

We stop writes at this point.
We store "hash slot index" + 1 (NULL is a mark of uninitialized cache slot)

We store an explicit offset to the name table so that if a regex is compiled on one host, saved, and then run on another where the size of pointers is different, all might still be well.

We update loop info and dominance info while we do this.
We use 2 different structs to allow non-copyable types to be used, as long as RelationToSourceReference() is passed.
We use 4096 bytes of padding rather than 4096 - sizeof(size_t) to not disturb the relative alignment of vmRegs.
We use ColumnFamilyMemTablesImpl to provide WriteBatch a way to access memtables of different column families (specified by ID in the write batch)
We use JSONDocument for DocumentDB API Implementation inspired by folly::dynamic, rapidjson and fbson
We use `vcold' for the slow-path `destroy' if `unlikelyDestroy' is true.
We use a / SmallVector of size 1 since after loop canonicalization we will always / have exactly one back edge block.
We use a Unix API, so pretend it's not Windows
We use a const char* instead of an std::string, as Google Test used to be used where std::string is not available.
We use a helper for this operation because the `storeqi' Vinstr can only take a 32-bit Immed, but we want to use it if possible instead of `store'.
We use a list of instructions for now so that we can keep the same interface and handle exploded retain_value later.
We use a reference to the next position to take care of the case where the N-bit at `pos' straddles a word boundary.
We use a sentinel value here so that we can create an empty value statically.
We use a similar strategy for Types in the full AST.
We use a structure so that new fields can be added on the end in future versions, without changing the API of the function, thereby allowing old clients to work without modification.
We use a temporary volatile variable (in a new block) in order to ensure that the optimizer does not mis-optimize the instructions.
We use a timeout on Linux, and in tests we want this timeout to be short.
We use an auxiliary map to / map the preheader's RPO number to the loop's ID.
We use it instead a regular map because it lazily imports a bunch of names into the current namespace when appropriate.
We use macro definition here because snprintf is a variadic function.
We use our own TR1 tuple if we aren't sure the user has an implementation of it already.
We use reinterpret_cast here as static_cast doesn't compile when T is a function type.
We use that trick in the OSX version of tls_datum().

We use the first field in a class layout as the instanceStart.
We use the super class as the new look up type.
We use these ids to link related loops together (to represent the loop nesting structure in the CFG).
We use this private typealias to make it easy to expand ArgumentModifier's size if we need to.
We use this single class to uniformly serialize variables according to different formats.

We want this class be usable both for inheritance (prive or protected) and for containment so __ctor and __dtor public

We will stop accepting new connections and finish ongoing requests without being interrupted in the middle of them.
We won't call this one again
We won't really modify the TypedValue in the non-D case, so this const_cast is safe.
We'd like these to be available from C code (in case we import some from somewhere), so this has a C interface.
We'd like to be able to record the status of every stack for every thread at this point, but during a timer handler is not a reasonable place to do this.
We'll automatically check and adjust the size number to make sure it conforms to the restrictions.

You may need to change this, or define these things yourself in this file.
You may need to increase this if your database has a large working set (budget one open file per 2MB of working set).
You may need to increase this if your database has a large working set.

You stream a bunch of values to a Message object.
You will incur the cost of a std::map look up whenever createCounter() is called.
You will still get an assertion if the Variant is an object, resource, etc.
You'd better avoid using f11...f15 in your applications if you want  the applications to be portable
You'll likely want to ensure the array coming in is a temporary (so it can be modified in place).
Your compile will fail if the condition isn't true, or can't be evaluated by the compiler.
Your implementaitn should call invokeFiltersOnClose() before anything else to make sure that any user-provided php_user_filter instances get to flush and clean up.
Your mileage may (in fact, will) vary, depending on the machine and the test data, but in general I believe this code is both shorter and faster.

if we cannot fit the new blob, fail the operation
if we compile with Xcode, we don't run build_detect_vesion, so we don't generate these variables this variable tells us about the git revision
if we have both, name comes before afterColon.
if we have no orig vector, set it to this vector and continue.
