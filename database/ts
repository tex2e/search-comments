"clean up error" occurs at this point
"hack"      in position 4 means HACK did match.
'Narrowable' types are types where narrowing actually narrows.
'a' should be of type 'number'
'actualText' is the text that the user has entered for the identifier.
'any' is narrowed to types other than 'Function'/'Object'
'any' is not narrowed when target type is 'Function'
'any' is not narrowed when target type is 'Object'
'await' here is an identifier, and not a yield expression.
'await' here is an identifier, and not an await expression.
'bar' should be resolvable
'const' is only a modifier if followed by 'enum'.
'foo' cannot be called in an unqualified manner.
'i' is for case insensitivity (We do this to match C# TODO comment code).
'in' does not have this effect.
'index' tracks the index of the most recent error that was checked.
'isClassMemberStart' should have hinted not to attempt parsing.
'm' is so we can find matches in a multi-line input.
'merge' the lines of each input file with any errors associated with it
'n' doesn't exist on type 'void'.
'p' should have type 'string'.
'private' should not be considered a member variable here.
'return' is an instance member
's' should be 'string', so this should be an error
'this' as a computed enum value
'this' as a parameter
'this' in module variable
'this' in optional super call
'this' in required super call
'this' should be not type to 'Foo' either
'this' should be type 'Foo' as well
'this' should not be available in a static initializer.
'toolsVersion' gets consumed by the managed side, so it's not unused.
'types' references has changed
'undefined' can be returned if the change range cannot be determined.
'y' should be a fundule here
'y' should be of type 'string'
'yield' here is an identifier, and not a yield expression.
(2) when the aliased symbol is originating from a named import.
(4), (5) are parsed as PrefixUnaryExpression
(Backward skipping is not supported.)
(Pattern: fogbar, Candidate: quuxfogbarFogBar).
(TS Exceptions: namespaces, function overloads, enums, and interfaces)
(These are verified by verifyCompilerOptions to have 0 or 1 "*" characters.)
(We prefer just `x` vs `"foo/bar".x`.)
(function/method) symbol(..signature)
(i.e. they're both BinaryExpressions with an assignment operator in it).
+ 3 for leading /**, - 5 in total for /**
- "(x,y)" is a comma expression parsed as a signature with two parameters.
- 'previousToken' is defined.
- Anything else points to the global "Object" constructor.
- Array and Tuple types point to the global "Array" constructor.
- Could not select overload for 'call' expression.
- Define local variable declarations.
- Enum and number types point to the global "Number" constructor.
- M is an optional property and S' contains no property of the same name as M.
- String literal types and strings point to the global "String" constructor.
- Symbol types point to the global "Symbol" constructor.
- The class contains a constructor that contains parameters with accessibility modifiers.
- The class has property declarations with initializers.
- The class is an export in a TypeScript namespace.
- The current protected region (array of try/catch/finally/end labels).
- The error value for a catch block.
- The function declaration is contained within the body of a generator function.
- The function expression is contained within the body of a generator function.
- The node has a questionToken.
- The node is an `extends` heritage clause that should be visited, but only allow a single type.
- The node's kind is ThisKeyword.
- The result of evaluating the verb delegated to the expression of a `yield*`.
- There exists a module declaration which actually impacts the value side.
- This calls processImportedModules for each module imported in the source file.
- This calls resolveModuleNames, and then calls findSourceFile for each resolved module.
- Type predicates and booleans point to the global "Boolean" constructor.
- Type references to classes (or class-like variables) point to the constructor for the class.
- Use 'getApparentTypeOfContextualType' when you're going to need the members of the type.
- Use 'getContextualType' when you are simply going to propagate the result to the expression.
- We do not substitute generated identifiers for any reason.
- We do not substitute identifiers tagged with the LocalName flag.
- We only substitute identifiers that are exported at the top level.
- baseUrl - this setting controls how non-relative module names are resolved.
- false:     the argument at 'i' *was* and *has been* permanently contextually typed.
- is the only character supported in JSX attribute names that isn't valid in JavaScript identifiers
- parameter is wrapped in function-like entity
- skip string literal and comma
- undefined: the argument at 'i' is *not* susceptible to permanent contextual typing.

If we already resolved to this file, it must have been a secondary reference.
If we are here it is because the name contains a binding pattern.

If we do successfully parse arrow-function, we must *not* recurse for productions 1, 2 or 3.
If we don't have a catch clause, then we must have a finally clause.
If we don't want the BOM, then skip it by setting the starting location to 3 (size of BOM).

If we hit an export in an illegal context, just bail out to avoid cascading errors.
If we hit an import declaration in an illegal context, just bail out to avoid cascading errors.
If we need to report an error, we already done so here.
If we read from the file, it must exist
If we see any required parameters, it means the prior ones were not in fact optional.
If we succeeded and got a do-while loop, then start looking for a 'while' keyword.
If we were able to find common type
If we were able to get any potential identifier...
If we were contiguous, then keep that value.
If we're acquiring, then this is the first time this LS is asking for this document.
If we're actually replacing the original statement, we need to signal this to the caller.
If we're exporting these variables, then these just become assignments to 'exports.x'.
If we're in an external module, we can't reference value symbols created from UMD export declarations
If we're in error recovery we tighten up what we're willing to match.
If we're just after a template tail, don't show signature help.
If we're on the last line, then limit it to the last character of the last line.
If we're only looking ahead, then tell the scanner to only lookahead as well.
If we've already seen an asterisk, then we can no longer parse a tag on this line
If we've computed data from children and cached it in this node
If writeFile is not specified then the writeFile callback from the compiler host will be used for writing the JavaScript and declaration files.
If x is already an integer, the result is x.
If year is between 0 and 99 is used, then year is assumed to be 1900 + year.
If you do not specify this parameter, the default value is a PNG format image.
If you include more than one locale string, list them in descending order of priority so that the first entry is the preferred locale.
If you just use p1:modes, the compiler accepts it - should be an error
If you omit this parameter, the default locale of the JavaScript runtime is used.

In a typed function call, an argument or substitution expression is contextually typed by the type of the corresponding parameter.
In all of these cases, we want to mark the next node as having had an error before it.
In an ambient declaration, the grammar only allows integer literals as initializers.
In an assignment expression, the right operand is contextually typed by the type of the left operand.
In an interface or class, we're definitely interested in a type.
In case of objStrOrNum3, the S is not union Type but object Literal so we go to next step.

In equality comparisons, NaN does not equal any value, including itself.
In fact, in certain editing scenarios, combining the lexical, syntactic, and semantic classifiers may issue the best user experience.
In fact, it is the case that the text of the name must be equal to 'ToString(numLit)' for this to hold.
In general cancelling is *not* safe for the type checker.
In incomplete call we want to be lenient when we have too few arguments
In second instance of same module, exported interface is not visible
In some cases, we need to emit a space between the operator and the operand.
In such situations, 'permitInvalidConstAsModifier' should be set to true.
In that case, we should check the argument.

In the case of rest element, we will omit rest element.
In this case initial path for secondary lookups is assumed to be the same as root directory of the project.
In this case we don't indent the next line in the next pass.
In this case, using getResolvedSymbol directly is required to avoid losing the members from the declaration.
In this case, we adjust the span to point to the function keyword.
In this case, we call getSymbolOfNode instead of getSymbolAtLocation because it is a declaration

The only way to trigger these errors is to try checking its return type.
The operation offset at which a code block begins or ends
The operation offset at which the label is defined.
The operation to perform.
The options struct has a matching property, just set it directly
The original height of the image resource before sizing.

The outer type parameters are those defined by enclosing generic classes, methods, or functions.
The parameter index and argument index for the type guard target is matching.
The parent must not be valid.
The parent node to take its indentation is the first parent that has indentation.
The path to the project root directory
The path used to retrieve the safe list
The pattern matcher maintains an internal cache of information as it is used.
The pattern of such special property access is that the parent symbol is the symbol of the file.
The position has to be: 1.
The position in newText the caret should point to after the insertion.
The prefix display parts.
The printer should invoke the onEmitNode callback when printing this node.
The program is asking for this file, check first if the host can locate it.
The properties are assigned in the order in which traversal should occur.
The properties of JSX.ElementAttributesProperty
The properties of an object include both fields (objects) and functions.
The property name for the edge.
The raw strings contain the (escaped) strings of what the user wrote.
The reactNamespace symbol should be marked as 'used' so we don't incorrectly elide its import.
The reason this is done inside the Indenter is because it only affects indentation behavior.
The reason this is not automatic is that 'of' is a valid identifier.
The reduce method calls the callbackfn function one time for each element in the array.
The reduceRight method calls the callbackfn function one time for each element in the array.
The regExp argument is a Regular expression object.
The relative paths are relative to the common directory
The rename info should be the same for every project
The result is always of the Boolean primitive type.
The result is always of the Number primitive type.
The result is that the user sees validation messages without actually submitting.
The result is undefined if the reference isn't a dotted name.
The return value indicates whether an error was in fact reported.
The return value of the callback function is the accumulated result, and is provided as an argument in the next call to the callback function.
The returned NavigationBarItem is more complicated and doesn't include 'parent', so we use these to do work before converting.
The rgExp argument is a Regular expression object.
The rules about 'yield' only apply to actual code/expression contexts.
The same applies to objects and arrays.
The same error should be observed in both cases.
The scope of a class constructor is hidden somewhere we don't expect :-S
The search scope is the container node
The search set contains at least the current symbol

The second operand type is boolean
The second operand type is number
The selectedItemIndex could be negative for several reasons.
The semantic error should not affect it
The separator display parts.
The set of things we consider semantically classifiable.
The shorter chain should come first.
The signature help items.
The signature helps items for the parameters.
The signature's documentation
The signatures of a union type are those signatures that are present in each of the constituent types.
The size in bytes of each element in the array.
The some method calls the callbackfn function for each element in array1 until the callbackfn returns true, or until the end of the array.
The source map location for the operation.
The span for which signature help should appear on a signature
The span of the document to actually collapse.
The span of the document to display when the user hovers over the collapsed span.
The specified symbol flags need to be reinterpreted as type flags
The square root of 0.5, or, equivalently, one divided by the square root of 2.
The square root of 2.
The start character offset of the symbol (on the line provided by the references request).
The statements for the current label.
The substring includes the characters up to, but not including, the character indicated by end.
The subtlety is in the latter portion, as we cannot reliably say that anything that looks like a numeric literal is a numeric name.
The suffix display parts.
The symbol is considered matched with the symbol in the list if and only if all given parameters must matched.
The symbol was an internal symbol and does not have a declaration e.g. undefined symbol
The symbol's kind (such as 'className' or 'parameterName' or plain 'text').
The symbol's kind (such as 'className' or 'parameterName').
The synthesized identifier for an imported external helpers module.
The temp name will be of the form _default_counter.
The template literal must have kind TemplateMiddleLiteral or TemplateTailLiteral.
The test suite will likely crash if you try 'jake runtests' with reference comments enabled.

The text property of a LiteralExpression stores the interpreted value of the literal in text form.
The text spans in this group
The text to display in the editor for the collapsed region.
The this object of the bound function is associated with the specified object, and has the specified initial parameters.
The top node is always a script or module node.
The total number of metacharacters removed from the file (so far)
The two 'A' modules, however, do get merged, so in reality we have 7 modules.
The two names can be identical.
The type marked incomplete
The type predicate type is assignable to the parameter type.
The type was not a PromiseLike, so it could not be unwrapped any further.
The unknownType indicates that an error already occurred (and was reported).
The update will in-turn call updateLanguageServiceSourceFile to get an updated SourceFile.
The user is probably in the middle of a generic type.
The value for January is 0, and other month values follow consecutively.
The value must be a non-negative number between 0 and the max value.
The value of previousIterationSymbol is undefined when the function is first called.
The version of the TypeScript compiler release
The version of the language service API
The weight of being first should be greater than the weight of being contiguous
Then check that the RHS is assignable to it.
Then it adds explicit `this` arguments to the static members.
Then the known content will be used upon opening instead of the disk copy
Then we recurse into the children of the node to bind them as well.
Then we sort case sensitively, so "aaa" will come before "Aaa".
Then we'll match 'U' against 'UI'.
There are many like it, but this one is mine.
There are situations in which a modifier like 'const' will appear unexpectedly, such as on a class member.
There are still more digits to decode, set the msb (6th bit)
There are three things we might try to look for.
There are two primary ways we can access `super` from within an async method.
There can never be a match.
There currently isn't a way to display the return tag comment
There have been crashes that might be caused by this violation.
There is a typeMap associated with this command-line option so use it to map value back to its name
There is already an error, so no need to report one.
There is no delimiter between list items (default).
There is no property named 'props' on this instance type
There is no reason for this other than that JSON.stringify does not handle it either.
There is no type ElementAttributesProperty, return 'any'
There is remaining text on this line that will be part of next source span so write marker that continues
There may be a destructuring assignment on the left side
There may be multiple files with different baselines.
There should be a parse error here.
There should be no errors in this file
There should be no reused nodes between two trees that are fully parsed.
There should now be a single error.
There was a blank line between the last comment and this comment.
There weren't enough container parts to match against the pattern parts.
There will be more than one if this is the result of merging.
Therefore only get diagnostics for given file.
Therefore we have to clean out large objects after the test is done.
Therefore, if the name we find is purely an export specifier, it is not actually considered in scope.
Therefore, we will have to recursively emit each element in the bindingPattern.
These are all legal modifiers.
These are always allowed.
These are mostly just helpers for the unit test.
These are number of spaces writer is going to write at current indent
These are translated into case clauses in a switch statement.
These events provide syntactic and semantic errors for a file.

These nodes should extend FunctionLikeDeclaration.
These rules are higher in priority than user-configurable rules.
These rules are lower in priority than user-configurable rules.
These should all be Opt3
These should all be of type 'any'
These should emit identically
These tentatively don't work.
These variables contain state that changes as we descend into the tree.
They are persisted between each SourceFile transformation and should not be reset.
They should be assignable to/from something of a type 'string'.
They should have no effect, as filtering completions is the responsibility of the editor.
They should not be assignable to either "Hello" or "World".
They will be emitted as part of visitClassDeclaration.
Things between opening and closing JSX tags
Things like "-d, --declaration" go in here.
Things we lazy load from the JSX namespace
This *could* be a parenthesized arrow function.
This *should* be every type other than null, undefined, void, and never
This T is the difference between C3 and C1
This allows the DocumentRegistry to store multiple copies of the same file for different compilation settings.
This also applies to all our other context flags as well.
This attribute is true when present on an element, and false when missing.
This call should be ok

This can refer to it as A.C.Z
This case and others are handled by the following code.
This case is covered by bug 3028.
This check is done before an open brace in a control construct, a function, or a typescript block declaration
This check is mainly used inside SpaceBeforeOpenBraceInControl and SpaceBeforeOpenBraceInFunction.
This check is to ensure we don't report error on constructor parameter property as that error would be reported during parameter emit
This command can be any of the command identifiers that can be executed in script.
This comment should appear for foo
This comment should appear for nonExportedFoo
This comment should appear for privateFoo

This comment should appear for static foo
This configuration file will be used to obtain a list of files and configuration settings for the project.
This container didn't match the pattern piece.

This gives us a quicker out in the common case where an object type is not a function.
This happens in incremental scenarios.
This helper creates an object with a "value" property that wraps the `super` property or indexed access for both get and set.
This helper function processes a list of projects and return the concatenated, sortd and deduplicated output of processing each project.
This information is used by the incremental parser to determine what sections of the script need to be re-parsed.
This interface is a base interface for ObjectLiteralExpression and JSXAttributes to extend from.

This is because we do incremental parsing in-place.
This is class c2 without constuctor
This is comment for c1
This is comment for c2 - the global class
This is comment for function signature
This is contextually typed as a tuple.
This is done by declaring new variable (out parameter holder) outside of the loop for every binding that is reassigned inside the body.
This is due to the fact that we emit the body of an async function inside of a generator function.
This is exported symbol

This is needed when we emit declaration file.
This is often the href of the document that the object is in, or the value set by a base element.
This is on import declaration
This is only used if there is no exact match.
This is optional for backwards-compatibility, but will be added if not provided.
This is possible in case if resolution is performed for directives specified via 'types' parameter.
This is probably not safe to reuse.

This isn't perfect, but it passes all of our tests.
This line can be seen as a sourceMappingURL comment
This list could either come from the config file, or from enumerating the types root + initial secondary types lookup location.
This list is a work in progress.
This may or may not be the actual node used.
This means that this is declaration of ambient module that is located in other module or namespace which is prohibited.
This means we are in a context that looks like a block to the user, but in the grammar is actually not a node (it's a class, module, enum, object type literal, etc).
This method *requires* a contiguous, complete, and ordered stream of classifications for a file.
This method *requires* an ordered stream of classifications for a file, and spans are highly recommended.
This method is a companion for 'resolveModuleNames' and is used to resolve 'types' references to actual type declaration files

This node is ES6 syntax, but is handled by a containing node.
This node is ES6 syntax.
This node is TypeScript syntax, and marks its container as also being TypeScript syntax.
This node is explicitly marked as TypeScript, so we should transform the node.
This node should be replaced with the UMD define helper.
This one doesn't have NodeFlags.Default on (as export default doesn't considered as modifiers)
This one is not truly a function, but for formatting purposes, it acts just like one
This one should be an error because the first type argument is not contained inside a type literal
This one should be okay, it's a valid way of distinguishing types
This only happens when we have something of the form: 'new C'
This property is changed in 'updateGraph' based on the set of files in program
This property is different from projectStructureVersion since in most cases edits don't affect set of files in the project
This pushes to the stack, so you must call `endNode` when you are done adding to this node.
This results in inconsistent behavior.
This returns a diagnostic even if the module will be an untyped module.
This seems to be faster than either `array.splice(i, 1)` or `array.copyWithin(i, i+ 1)`.
This should be a block body
This should be emitted
This should be error since prototype would be static property on class m
This should be the 'false' state for that flag.
This should be the identifier 'I'
This should be the identifier 'declare'
This should be the identifier 'interface'
This should be verified outside of here and a proper error thrown.
This should issue a large error, not a small one
This should probably stop working in the future.
This should result in error
This should result in type ClassB

This shoulnot be help comment
This signature will contribute to contextual union signature
This speed is expressed as a multiple of the normal speed of the media resource.
This step isn't needed if we eventually transform this to ES5.
This trailing Comment1
This type of declaration is permitted only in the global module.
This value denotes the character position in line and is different from the 'column' because of tab characters.
This value is only used for numbers.
This value is set on demand.
This wasn't the start of a token.
This will allow types number, string, symbol or any.
This works whether the declaration is a var, let, or const.
This would probably be safe to reuse.
Though, we do extra check on the context to make sure we are dealing with get/set node.
Throws an error because a function is not implemented.
Thus, the type inferred for 'x' is number and the type inferred for 's' is string.
Thus, we include intersection types on the source side here.

To access the non-shim (i.e. actual) language service, use the "ls.languageService" property.
To achieve that we will keep iterating until the result stabilizes.
To avoid invernal conversion, the key of the referencedFiles map must be of type Path
To create a default DocumentRegistry, use createDocumentRegistry to create one, and pass it to all subsequent createLanguageService calls.
To do this, the method will back parse the expression starting at the position required.
To find the correct statement, we look for the adjacent node on the left of the semicolon.
To test whether a value is equivalent to NaN, use the isNaN function.
Todo: add support for ModuleResolutionHost too

Typescript function declarations can have modifiers, decorators, and type annotations.
Typically there is one pass with Extensions.TypeScript, then a second pass with Extensions.JavaScript.

WAWA is not a valid type
Walk the primary type lookup locations
Was: Error: Supplied parameters do not match any signature of call target
We actually need to verify smart (virtual) identation here rather than actual identation.
We add the location to preserve comments.
We allow type members to be separated by commas or (possibly ASI) semicolons.
We already had a source file for this file name.
We already perform checking on the type arguments on the class declaration itself.
We also have seen a starting asterisk.
We are *only* completing on properties from the type being destructured.
We are at the beginning of the file
We are either parented by another statement, or some sort of block.
We are elaborating errors and the cached result is an unreported failure.
We are here because ES2016 adds support for the exponentiation operator.
We are here because a ComputedPropertyName was used somewhere in the expression.
We are here because we contain a SpreadElementExpression.
We are in JSX context and the token is part of JSXElement.
We assume the first line starts at position 0 and 'position' is non-negative.
We can parse out an optional semicolon in ASI cases in the following cases.
We can't reuse statement nodes.
We cannot answer semantic questions within a with block, do not proceed any further
We cannot use createDiagnosticFromNode because nodes do not have parents yet
We check if the project file list has changed.
We conservatively include alias symbols to cover cases where they're emitted as locals
We detect and provide better error recovery when we encounter a git merge marker.
We didn't already have the file.
We didn't even have an open paren.
We didn't have a direct match.
We didn't have any sig help items produced by the TS compiler.
We do a check here so that we won't be doing unnecessarily call to "lookAhead"
We do not perform structural deduplication on intersection types.
We do not yet support types.
We do, however, need to decode JSX entities.
We don't need them otherwise.
We don't need to pass the extension here because "doTypeAndSymbolBaseline" will append appropriate extension of ".types" or ".symbols"
We don't respond to the second one.
We don't want the BOM, skip it by setting the starting location to 3 (size of BOM).
We don't want to accidentally hold onto it for too long.
We don't want to consider things like '(1)' a type.
We either have a binary operator here, or we're finished.
We emit `null` here to indicate to `__decorate` that it can invoke `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor` directly.
We emit hoisted variables early to align roughly with our previous emit output.
We first sort case insensitively.
We force resolution here such that we catch circularities now.
We found no signatures at all, which is an error
We get back a set of edits, but langSvc.editScript only accepts one at a time.
We handle that case here.
We have a remapping of this name, use that instead
We have a transition from an upper to a lower letter here.
We have already reported the errors for the invalid signature.
We have an element that intersects the change range in some way.
We have an entry for this file.
We have this extra argument here so that we can inject an explicit property descriptor at a later date.
We have to check this without calling getSymbol.
We have to do this to avoid emitting trailing commas.
We have to explicitly emit square bracket and bracket because these tokens are not store inside the node.
We have to explicitly emit square bracket and bracket because these tokens are not stored inside the node.
We have to use this name for start pos
We have type references to same target type, see if all type arguments are identical
We have type references to same target type, see if relationship holds for all type arguments
We haven't looked for this file, do so now and cache result
We just return 'undefined' in that case.
We just want to consume and move on.
We know *exactly* where things went wrong when comparing the types.
We know we don't have a binding pattern or computed name here
We lower-case all type references because npm automatically lowercases all packages.
We may be here because of some extra nodes between overloads that could not be parsed into a valid node.
We may need to update both the 'pos' and the 'end' of the element.
We might not be able to resolve type symbol so use unknown type in that case (eg error case)
We must be parented by a statement.
We must have a (possible ASI) semicolon.
We need the original "Scope type" for completion list, etc.

We need to enable substitutions for identifiers and shorthand property assignments.
We need to enable substitutions for identifiers.
We need to filter out partial properties in union types
We need to look one token ahead to see if it permissible to try parsing a declaration.
We need to make sure that the filePath is prefixed with "lib." not just containing "lib." and end with ".d.ts"
We need to remove to create our regex correctly.
We need to return null because baselining isn't required.
We need to return null here or the runBaseLine will actually create a empty file.
We need to trim trailing whitespace between the tokens if they were on different lines, and no rule was applied to put them on the same line
We need to use 'null' to interface with the managed side.
We only disallow modifier on a method declaration if it is a property of object-literal-expression
We only narrow if all case expressions specify values with unit types
We only narrow variables and parameters occurring in a non-assignment position.
We only need to format if the block is multiline context.
We only sort nodes by name that have a more-or-less "direct" name, as opposed to `new()` and the like.
We only support expressions that are simple qualified names.
We only try to find one if this flag is undefined, indicating that we haven't made an attempt.
We only use this subset of the compiler options.
We only want to emit assignments for variables with initializers.
We parse any expression (including a comma expression).
We perform subtype reduction upon obtaining the final array type from an evolving array type.
We perform two passes over the arguments.
We preserve this behavior so we can accurately compare times.
We request to be advised when the printer is about to print this node.
We should also get the exact same set of diagnostics.
We should catch these changes and report them.
We should delete old inferred project and attach open file to the new one
We should get the same tree when doign a full or incremental parse.
We should not get a regex here becuase of the / in the comment.
We should only get here for methods on an object literal with regular identifier names.
We should prefer something that starts at the beginning if possible
We should still emit the comments if we are emitting a system module.
We sort and deduplicate the constituent types based on object identity.
We still have both chains.
We still have one chain remaining.
We store 'A' as associated with a NavNode, and use getModuleName to traverse down again.
We track type references (created by createTypeReference) and instantiated types (created by instantiateType)
We treat locals and exports of the same name as mutually exclusive within a container.
We use 1 NavNode to represent 'A.B.C', but there are multiple source nodes.
We want the index of the previous line start, so we subtract 1.
We want to align our "syntax" and "examples" commands to a certain margin.
We want to find what index we're at.
We want to maintain quotation marks.
We want to order the braces when we return the result.
We want to treat type as an iterable, and get the type it is an iterable of.
We want to try to avoid emitting a return statement in certain cases if a user already returned something.
We were canceled while performing the operation.
We won't ever check this.
We would like to emit the subexpression as-is.
We'll have 3 pattern parts Si/U/I against two candidate parts Simple/UI.
We'll know whether we have other default exports depending on if `symbol` already has a declaration list set.
We'll only assert invariants outside of light mode.
We'll use a separate list for module names that are definitely unknown.
We're changing from a generator to a non-genarator.
We're changing from a non-generator to a genarator.
We're going to append a representation of the current time at the end of the current version.
We're in a context where 'yield expr' is not allowed.
We're likely here because of error recovery
We're looking up possible property names from contextual/inferred/declared type.
We're now at a node that is entirely past the position we're searching for.
We've already gotten one pattern part match in this candidate.
We've already marked this child as the best so far.
We've had some invalidation errors where adding a member to a generic type with statics could cause a crash to occur
We, thus, need to check if whatever was inside the quotes is actually a valid identifier name.
What kind of match this was.
What was thrown, or the string 'Falsy' if something falsy was thrown.
When adding evolving array element types we do not perform subtype reduction.
When calling this function from compiler-runner, the baselinePath will then has either ".ts" or ".tsx" extension
When calling this function from rwc-runner, the baselinePath will have no extension.
When changing this make sure the changes are reflected in the managed side as well
When comparing call or construct signatures, parameter names are ignored and rest parameters correspond to an unbounded expansion of optional parameters of the rest parameter element type.
When deleting a file, the passed baseFileName is null
When doing so we want to hightlight the passed in source map node since thats the one needing this temp assignment
When errorNode is undefined, it means we should not report any errors.
When files are deleted from disk, the triggered "rename" event would have a relativefileName of "undefined"
When present, marks an element that can't be submitted without a value.
When targeting es6, arrow function lexically bind "this" so we do not need to do the work of binding "this" in emitted code
When there are no attributes, React wants "null"
When these don't start a declaration, they're an identifier in an expression statement
When used with the max and min attributes, lets you control the range and increment (for example, allow only even numbers) that the user can enter into an input field.
When used with the max and step attributes, lets you control the range and increment (such as even numbers only) that the user can enter into an input field.
Where the sourcemap file is written
Whether 'super' occurs in a static context within a class.
Whether 'this' occurs in a static context within a class.
Whether a synthesized node should start on a new line (used by transforms).
Whether file has mixed content (i.e. .cshtml file that combines html markup with C#/JavaScript)
Whether or not a 'node' is preceded by a label of the given string.
Whether or not the pattern contained dots or not.
Whether or not this chunk is entirely lowercase.
Whether or not this object has any failures (including in its descendants)
Whether or not this region should be automatically collapsed when the 'Collapse to Definitions' command is invoked.
Whether or not we should format on keystrokes
Whether or not we've had a parse error since creating the last AST node.
Whether the call is an error is determined by assignability of the arguments.
Whether the code block is opened or closed
Whether the parameter is optional or not.
Whether the signature accepts a variable number of arguments.
Which error we report depends on whether there was a string constituent.
While it seems that DiagnosticMessageChain is structurally similar to DiagnosticMessage, the difference is that messages are all preformatted in DMC.
While neither Animal nor TallThing satisfy the constraint, T is at worst a Giraffe and compatible with both via covariance.
Widening type "hello"
Will either be a CallExpression, NewExpression, or Decorator.

Windows Script Host version
With call signature count mismatch
With call signatures with different return type
With noImplicitThis, functions may not reference 'this' if it has type 'any'
Without explicit type annotation, this is just an array.
Without these methods, only completions for ambient modules will be provided.
Won't-fixed: Smart indent during chained function calls
Works for constructors too
Works like Array.prototype.find, returning `undefined` if no element satisfying the predicate is found.
Works with relative file name
Wrap in try catch because getEffectiveTypeRoots touches the filesystem

You can also use the pause or play events to tell whether the media is playing or not.
You can tell that we are contextually typing because of the contextualMapper parameter.
_this needs to be emitted to the js file
`classSymbol` is the class where the constructor was defined.
`containerName` is the expression used inside of the enum for assignments.
`containerName` is the expression used inside of the namespace for exports.
`declarationName` is the name of the local declaration for the parameter.
`del` further depends on `Promise` (and is also not included), so we just, patch the global scope's Promise to Q's (which we already include in our deps because gulp depends on it)
`exportName` is the expression used within this node's container for any exported references.
`expressionName` is the name of the parameter used in expressions.
`localName` is the expression used within this node's containing scope for any local references.
`parameterName` is the declaration name used inside of the enum.
`parameterName` is the declaration name used inside of the namespace.
`parent` is the current parent and is *not* stored in parentsStack.
`readonly` won't work outside of property parameters
`startNode` sets a new parent and `endNode` returns to the previous parent.
`start` should be included in `references`.
`yield` expressions are transformed using the generators transformer.
`yield` will be handled by a generators transform.
a 0 arg call signature
a and b have the same name, but they may not be mergeable.
a badly malformed tag should not be added to the list of tags
a bug made this not report the same error as below
a construct signature that returns a union type
a construct signature that returns any
a construct signature with generics
a constructor signature
a generated block associated with a 'with' statement
a generated block that tracks the target for 'break' statements in a 'switch' statement
a generated block that tracks the targets for 'break' and 'continue' statements, used for iteration statements
a generated exception block, used for 'try' statements
a is narrowed to "string'
a path to directory watcher map that detects added tsconfig files
a prime or an odd constant
a transient placeholder that is used to mark predicted resolution in the result list
a type with a prototype that has any type
a type with a prototype, it overrides the construct signature
a value of a primitive type, or an object literal mapping named values to actual values
a1 is a valid identifier
above is equivalent to this:
accessing getter property
actual start of the node is past the position - previous token should be at the end of previous child
add "use strict" as the first statement
add a root file to project
add extra 1 to prevent missing tests due to rounding
add extra variables to hold out parameters if necessary
add instance property and method
add prologue directives to the list (if any)
add static property and method
add two config file as root files
add typing name to missing set so we won't process it again
add typings for unresolved imports
addPrologueDirectives will simply put already-existing directives at the beginning of the target statement-array
addRange correctly handles cases when wither 'from' or 'to' argument is missing
added level of function nesting
additional optional properties do not cause errors
addresses github issue #4903:
adjust the container reference in case if super is used inside arrow functions with arbitrarily deep nesting
after all there is no point to invalidate it if we have no idea where to look for the module.
alias for 'this' from the calling code stack frame in case if this was used inside the converted loop
alias not used in typeof
aliases that need to have this symbol visible
all expected to be valid
all exported names local to module
all invocations here are illegal
all jsDocComment nodes were already visited
all of these are errors
all of these are valid
all of these invocations are errors
all ok - second argument is processed before x is fixed
all the necesarry information to set the right compiler settings
all the necessary information to set the right compiler settings
allow references to constant members of other enums
allowComputedPropertyNames
allowPositionInLeadingTrivia
allowTrailingRecursion
also a Media Event Keyboard Events
also allowed, used to be errors
also if HasImplicitReturn flag is not set this means that all codepaths in function body end with return or throw
also works for 'apply'
always pop stack because post only called when child has been visited
always process imported modules to record module name resolutions
ambient context - no codegen impact
ambiguous (up and down conversion)
an actual value if it did match.
an object literal mapping named values to actual values
and all the comments.
and that matches the original signature for assignability since we treat its T's as Object
another level of indirection
another line in the comment
another operation was already scheduled for this id - cancel it
any as left operand, result is type Any except plusing string
any as right operand, result is type Any except plusing string
any is assignable to number
any is assignable to void.
any is not a valid type argument unless there is no constraint, or the constraint is any
any satisfies constraint and passes assignability check between 'target' properties
any, not a subtype of number so it skips that overload, is a subtype of itself so it picks second (if truly ambiguous it would pick first overload)
any, return types are not subtype of first overload
any, should be boolean
any, should be number
any, should be string
appears after a recursive directory wildcard.
apply asynchronous additions to the synchronous output
apply changes in reverse order
args should have only non-scoped packages - scoped packages are not yet supported
argumentCount is either 1 or (numSpans + 1) to account for the template strings array argument.
argumentCount is the *apparent* number of arguments.
arrow function paramter
assert that import will success once file appear on disk
assignable because null is widened, and therefore BCT is any
assigned number to string
assignment should be legal (both U's get instantiated to any for comparison)
assumes file.contents is a Buffer
async function with which promised type is void - return can be omitted
async method with assignment/destructuring on 'super' requires a binding
async method with only call/get on 'super' does not require a binding
async/await is ES2017 syntax
at least one of declarations should come from non-modified source file
at the end of a regular expression (due to trailing flags like '/foo/g').
at the end of the comment
at the end position of an unterminated token.
at this point if file is the part of some configured/external project then this project should be created
at this point the only legal case for parent is ClassLikeDeclaration
augment ComponentOptions
augment sys so first ts.executeCommandLine call will be finish silently
autoDiscovery is set in typing options - use it even if project contains only .ts files

foo doesn't exist, so both references should be in error
foo should still be there
foo.A should be ok but foo.bar should be error
fooFunctionValue param
foo_0 not an external module
for `a()` target is `a` and thisArg is `void 0`
for accurate classification, the actual token should be passed in.
for case-sensitive file systems check if we've already seen some file with similar filename ignoring case

for now ignore jsdoc comments
for now treat files as JavaScript
for now we just check if the next token is an identifier.

i points to the first non whitespace character
i.e. 'undefined' in position 3 above means TODO(jason) didn't match.
i.e. default settings
i.e. if a user keeps making successive edits to a script we will have a text change from V1 to V2, V2 to V3, ..., Vn.
i.e. super call is legal in constructor but not legal in the class body.
i.e. the same calls with the same parameters will return the same values.
i.e. the span starting at 30 with length 30 is increased to length 40.

if child is a list item - try to get its indentation
if child is last and there is more room and only one node to place, place it
if child node is a token, it does not impact indentation, proceed it using parent indentation scope rules
if containing type was not found or it is ambient - exit (no codegen)
if current structure version is the same - return info witout any changes
if file has passed all checks it should be safe to reuse it
if file was external module with augmentations - this fact should be preserved in .d.ts as well.
if host does not support 'directoryExists' assume that directory will exist
if it is in the list, then we are done
if it's static, enter it into the class's member list directly
if jsx is specified then treat file as .tsx
if language service is disabled assume that all files in program are root files + default library
if localSymbol is defined on node then node itself is exported - check is required
if module symbol has already been merged - it is safe to use it.
if no - position is in the node itself so we should recurse in it.
if outer converted loop has already accumulated some state - pass it through
if range is on single line, we will never make this state transition
if shimHost is a COM object then property check will become method call with no arguments.
if specified a project, we only return affected file list in this project

if the chains are done, then these messages are the same.
if the current token is var, let or const, skip the VariableDeclarationList
if the enclosing function is an ArrowFunction is then we use the captured 'this' keyword.
if the given file has no dependencies, there is no context to return, it can be compiled without additional work
if the next token is not on the same line as yield.
if the node is a member in a JSDoc namespace
if the open curly belongs to a non-indented object, do nothing here.
if the parent is the class constructor, use the constructor scope
if the ref count for this directory watcher drops to 0, it's time to close it
if the text didn't change, then we can just return our current source file as-is.
if the whitespace crosses the margin, take only the whitespace that passes the margin
if there are break statements that match this switch, then just link cond block with block after switch
if there are not projects that include this script info - delete it
if there was an explicit match kind specified, then it should be validated.
if this is the case - then we should assume that token in question is located in previous child.
if this method has a body and its parent is a class declaration, this is a valid target.
if this token is the first token following the list of decorators, we do not need to indent
if token line equals to the line of containing node (this is a first token in the node) - use node indentation
if true - then file should be recompiled even if it does not have any changes.
if underlying system can distinguish between two files whose names differs only in cases then file name already in canonical form.
if we don't have a cursor, we could never return a node from the old tree.
if we don't, rewind and return nothing.
if we have a program - release all files that are enlisted in program
if yes - then position is in the trivia and we need to look into the previous child to find the token in question.

issue custom error message for super property access in constructor arguments (to be aligned with old compiler)
issue: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/10778
it does error here as expected
it is a label definition and not a target, search within the parent labeledStatement
it is an error to have duplicate index signatures of the same kind in a type
it is ok to have member named '_super' or '_this' - member access is always qualified
it is type of the symbol uses itself recursively
it preserves the name of the class for use in error messages it throws if no render function is defined
it renders a simple stateless component with prop
it renders based on context in the constructor
it renders based on state using initial values in this.props
it renders based on state using props in the constructor
it renders only once when setting state in componentWillMount
it renders using forceUpdate even when there is no state
it setState through an event handler
it should be treated like a space
it should error here because it returns undefined
it should not implicitly bind event handlers
it should render with null in the initial state property
it should throw with non-object in the initial state property
it should warn when misspelling componentWillReceiveProps
it should warn when misspelling shouldComponentUpdate
it supports classic refs
it supports this.context passed via getChildContext

valid with noImplicitAny
valid, T is inferred to be Date
valid, even though x is a Base, parameter covariance works even after contextual signature instantiation
