2.11 won't apply an implicit conversion targeting Object, but we can manually invoke the converter provided by the view bound.
@note Mesos doesn't gate traffic on /health so all pre-bind warmup needs to happen in `prebindWarmup()`

A simple http service for serving up information pulled from a build.properties file.
Add the following to the `onExit` hook to export the Sink to a file when the server exits, or place it behind an endpoint to be triggered by request.
An HTTP server is bound to a configurable port (default: 9900) to which commands can be sent and information queried.
An admin http server which serves requests outside the default finagle worker pool.
An entry is a 3-tuple of Logger, Level and message.
As an admin endpoint, it displays the entire registry in JSON.

Constructs a ResourceHandler which tries to read resources from disk on every request, falling back to resources from the jar if needed.

For DI (Dependency Injection) Twitter Server uses self-typed Scala traits that might be mixed in the `TwitterServer` trait.
For each key return a cumulative percentage
For each key return a percentage
For example, if it's a request from a browser and the content is an html fragment.
For unknown types, make an attempt to deserialize primitive values.
From the Dtab docs: A Dtab--short for delegation table--comprises a sequence of delegation rules.
Generates an html table to display key statistics of a histogram
Generates html for the histogram selection page (/admin/histograms)
Generates html for visualizing histograms
Give the application control over when to present to Mesos as being ready for traffic.
Given a list of loggers, we can generate a list of captures by sequencing the actions to generate arbitrary Levels.
Helps make early gc pauses more consistent.
However, the ClientBuilder API provides an easy to install retry filter with a separate StatsFilter that reports to "tries".
However, then we may choose to add a `System.promoteAllLiveObjects()` hook.
Ideally this runs in the moments right before your service starts accepting traffic.
If histograms are available, add an additional endpoint
If none return a non-404, the response of the last service is used.
If possible, access histograms inside statsReceiversLoaded
If present, the html page will link to the metrics graphs for this entry.
If the given list of `services` is empty the resulting services will be always answering with 404.
If this side-effect were to disappear in a future version of the jdk, it would not be disastrous.
Implements "glog" style log formatting.
In order to launch the `AbstractTwitterServer` instance, the `main` method should be explicitly defined.
In particular, /health and /ping should be served in-band so that they are an accurate proxy of server health.
Initialize the capture sink with this capture configuration.
Inputs for which the resolver is undefined will be 404s.
Intended for use only when developing locally, to enable saving a file, refreshing the browser, and immediately seeing the change.
Interpret the journal by running each entry through the logger.
It makes sense to define it within an inner class `Main` as shown below.
It may miss allocations where large objects are eagerly allocated into the old generation along with some other cases.
It provides common application components such as an administrative HTTP server, tracing, stats, etc.
It's a pprof "raw" profile.
It's intended to be used as a handler for TwitterServer, and doesn't take any arguments yet.

Mesos/Aurora lifecycle endpoints
Mix-in to include service-loaded hooks.
Namer records weights as Doubles, so this should never happen.
Necessary for controller to determine that this is a request for HTML.
NewHooks are service-loaded.
Note that this method simply checks if the given `contentType` is a substring of the "Accept" header.
Note, don't use `scala.sys.props` until we are on 2.12: https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/4372
Note, the view is wrapped around the underlying service selectively.
Note, unnamed clients are ignored as we can't dissambiguate their stats.
Note, unnamed servers are ignored as we can't dissambiguate their stats.
Note, we don't serve all of /admin on a separate worker pool because it's important to serve certain admin endpoints in-band with the server.
Note: The events iterator can be potentially large, so to avoid fully buffering a big HTML document, we stream it as soon as it's ready.
Note: due to race conditions, the number reported is NOT a monotonically increasing value.
Parse a byte stream into a list of events.

The Event.Types the parser can construct.
The `main` method of this server.
The address to which the Admin HTTP server is bound.
The name used for the finagle server.
The percentage is either the density or a cumulative density for the bucket
The service is bound to a port and warmed up, announce health.
The success rate represents the health of the client on the request path while availability is a measure of session health.
These entries are "run" by invoking log with the tuple arguments.
These features are wired in correctly for use in production at Twitter.
This can be overridden in the super class or set on the command line with -admin.port.
This is bad news for things like com.twitter.util.Time
This is intended for use in situations in local development (e.g. so one can save a resource, refresh the browser, and see the change immediately).
This is ok, this Future is still useful for the assertion that `sink` and Response reader are connected.
This is useful to avoid the returned fragment being wrapped with an index in the context of an ajax call.
This line fails without the JsonDeserialize annotation in Envelope.
This logging event should have made it to the sink unless: - the capture spec turned capture off for this logger
This parameter can be omitted if not querying for plots
This relies on the side-effect of a full gc that all objects in the young generation are promoted to the old generation.
This server shadows vital endpoints (ex.
Threads that say they are runnable, but are actually doing nothing.
Together, these describe how to bind a path to an Addr.
Tries to load resources using directoryResolver in baseDirectory, and if that fails, tries jarResolver in baseResourcePath.
Twitter Server defines a template from which servers at Twitter are built.
Used for warmup tasks that we want to run before we accept traffic.
Useful to check cluster consistency.
We have to run this in a pool or Reader.read ends up blocking, because we call Await.result in the sink events iterator.
We require an annotation here, because for small numbers, this gets deserialized with a runtime type of int.
When the method `warmupComplete()` is invoked, the application is considered ready.
Wraps content returned from the underlying service with a view of the index.

for java + backwards compatibility
in the interest of keeping this simple, if the eden's current used is less than the last edenAllocated we will only return the number of bytes we have gc-ed from the eden.
note, these could be -1 if the collector doesn't have support for it.
