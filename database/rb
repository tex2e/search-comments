Action Controller sends content to the user by using one of five rendering methods.
Action Mailer allows you to send email from your application using a mailer model and views.
Action Mailer is nicely integrated with Active Job so you can generate and send emails in the background (example: outside of the request-response cycle, so the user doesn't have to wait on it):
Action Mailer provides hooks into the Mail observer and interceptor methods.
Action Mailer provides some intelligent defaults for your emails, these are usually specified in a default method inside the class definition:
Action View contexts are supplied to Action Controller to render a template.
Action View templates can be written in several ways.
Action builder which provides a nice DSL for building up a middleware sequence for Vagrant actions.
Action runner for executing actions in the context of this environment.
Action template sets variable that's picked up by layout
ActionCable.server.broadcast "comments_for_45", author: 'DHH', content: 'Rails is just swell'
ActionCable.server.remote_connections.where(current_user: User.find(1)).disconnect
ActionController::Parameters.new(person: nil).require(:person) ActionController::ParameterMissing: param is missing or the value is empty: person
ActionController::Parameters.new.require(:person) ActionController::ParameterMissing: param is missing or the value is empty: person
ActionController::Renderer allows you to render arbitrary templates without requirement of being in controller actions.
ActionController::Renderers.remove(:csv)
ActionController::TestCase will also automatically provide the following instance variables for use in the tests:
ActionController::TestCase will automatically infer the controller under test from the test class name.
ActionController::TestCase will be deprecated and moved to a gem in Rails 5.1.
ActionDispatch::Reloader provides prepare and cleanup callbacks, intended to assist with code reloading during development.
ActionDispatch::Request#GET will re-raise as a BadRequest error.
ActionMailer::Base.preview_interceptors.delete(ActionMailer::InlinePreviewInterceptor)
ActionPack uses this to find a suitable partial to represent the object.
ActionView::Template is one of a few sources of potential encoding issues in Rails.
Actions not specified are not changed.
Activate the gem you are reporting the issue against.
Active Job has adapters for the following queueing backends:
Active Job has two built-in queue adapters intended for development and testing: +:async+ and +:inline+.
Active Job objects can be configured to work with different backend queuing frameworks.
Active Job objects can be defined by creating a class that inherits from the ActiveJob::Base class.
Active Job provides hooks during the life cycle of a job.
Active Record allows inheritance by storing the name of the class in a column that is named "type" by default.
Active Record associations can be used to describe one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many relationships between models.
Active Record can serialize any object in text columns using YAML.
Active Record collections delegate their representation in XML to this method.
Active Record implements aggregation through a macro-like class method called #composed_of for representing attributes as value objects.
Active Record looks at the fixture's model class, discovers the correct primary key, and generates it right before inserting the fixture into the database.
Active Record objects don't specify their attributes directly, but rather infer them from the table definition with which they're linked.
Active Record saves the ids of the records from the first query to use in the second.
Active Record supports multiple database systems.
Active Record supports optimistic locking if the +lock_version+ field is present.
Active Record takes care of building the query to avoid injection attacks, and will convert from the ruby type to the database type where needed.
Active Record uses table aliasing in the case that a table is referenced multiple times in a join.
Active Record won't persist value objects that have been changed through means other than the writer method.
Active Record's #find_each ignores various extra parameters
Active Records accept constructor parameters either in a hash or as a block.
ActiveModel is a class to be implemented by each ORM to allow Rails to generate customized controller code.
ActiveModel::Validations A set of common cases for ActiveModel::Validations message generation that are used to generate tests to keep things DRY

Adding it is quite simple, you just need to include the module in a specific controller or in +ApplicationController+ in case you want it available in your entire application:
Adding, removing, and changing attributes and their type is done directly in the database.
Additional +prerelease+ gems may also be created:
Additional HTML attributes for the link can be passed in +html_options+.
Additional arguments to pass to `docker build` when creating an image using the build dir setting.
Additional arguments to pass to `docker run` when creating the container for the first time.

Additionally, the +helper+ class method can receive and evaluate a block, making the methods defined available to the template.
Additionally, the class-level +table_name_prefix+ is prepended and the +table_name_suffix+ is appended.
Additionally, the digestor will automatically look through your template file for explicit and implicit dependencies, and include those as part of the digest.
Additionally, the last version in this order is always considered the "current" version.
Additionally, the platform will match if the local CPU is 'arm' and the other CPU starts with "arm" (for generic ARM family support).
Additionally, the source reflection and/or through reflection may be subject to polymorphism and/or STI.
Additionally, when dealing with numeric values, a query method will return false if the value is zero.
Additionally, you should take care to make sure you are not relying on the ability to decode signed cookies generated by your app in external applications or JavaScript before upgrading.

Also closes the storage.
Also contains a dependency that was used to introduce this activation.
Also converts '/' to '::' which is useful for converting paths to namespaces.
Also converts downcase url encoded string to uppercase.
Also detects duplicated IDs.

Also includes options.
Also indicates there's a line break.
Also known as accessing "the reddit".
Also known simply as +ARGV+.

As a Ruby committer, run this in an SVN repository to commit a change.
As a caveat: uncommitted changes will not be deployed.
As a consequence changes to the database are not seen outside your connection until the operation is complete.
As a response to any other command, it indicates either that the server is shutting down, or that the server is timing out the client connection due to inactivity.
As a rule of thumb you can think of +camelize+ as the inverse of underscore, though there are cases where that does not hold:
As a rule of thumb you can think of +underscore+ as the inverse of camelize, though there are cases where that does not hold:
As a side effect, the IO buffer is flushed before determining the size.
As a simplistic example:
As a special case, `--version` is implemented directly in `brew.rb`.
As a special exception, when this code is copied by Racc into a Racc output file, you may use that output file without restriction.
As an alternative, it is recommended to use one of the following methods.
As an engine can now be a rack endpoint, it can also have a middleware stack.
As an example, the built-in +Time+ conversion is used.
As an example, we might have an extension that defines multiple classes in its Init_xxx method.
As blocks (or rather the Proc objects that represent them) are not marshallable, the block executes in the local, not the remote, context.
As explained in Channel, most of the time, these broadcastings are streamed directly to the clients subscribed to the named broadcasting.
As for #each_header, except the keys are provided in capitalized form.
As it is written, the return of this code is limited to `false` and whatever the return of the method is.
As long as the indentation of this method is consistent with that of the last one, we're fine.
As mentioned in #test_checkout_fairness, we don't care about strict fairness.
As much character data as possible is grouped into each text node: a text node never has an immediately following or preceding sibling that is a text node.
As of the beginning of October, 2011, no gem includes nonexistent modules.
As soon as this is fixed, this middleware can and will be removed.
As such, changes to `lock_optimistically`, or `locking_column` would not be picked up.
As such, changes to `time_zone_aware_attributes`, or `skip_time_zone_conversion_for_attributes` would not be picked up.
As such, we convert to a relative path unless we are using Ruby 1.9.x on Windows.
As such, you probably want to tighten it from the default.
As the primaries didn't hold a share lock, as soon as the outer one was released, all the exclusive locks are free to be acquired in turn.
As there are objects, use PrettyPrint::Text#add to include the objects and the width to utilized by the String version of this object.
As this is a deprecated function of Jekyll.
As this is both cryptic and usually redundant, it should be avoided.
As this is the most popular route of most Rails applications, this is beneficial.
As this method is used in many places, and often wraps large portions of user code, it has an additional design goal of minimizing its impact on the visible call stack.
As we are using Action View's +image_tag+ method, you can pass in any other options you want:
As we haven't started doing any real work yet, we should pretend that we never made it off the queue.
As with "to", all URL reserved characters must be encoded.
As with +belongs_to+, Active Record reflects on the fixture's model class and discovers the +has_and_belongs_to_many+ associations.
As with all network services, security needs to be considered when using dRuby.
As you can pass in any header, you need to either quote the header as a string, or pass it in as an underscored symbol, so the following will work:
As you can see the integration test involves multiple controllers and exercises the entire stack from database to dispatcher.
As you can see, the workhorse is RSS::Parser#parse, which takes the source of the feed and a parameter that performs validation on the feed.
As you can see, this is a very Builder-like DSL.
As you may know, some functions, such as ActionController::Base#url_for and ActionView::Helpers::UrlHelper#link_to, can generate URLs given a set of parameters.
As you see the proc takes a +source+ parameter.
As you see, the HTML reflects knowledge about the resource in several spots, like the path the form should be submitted to, or the names of the input fields.
As you see, we use the output embeddings for the render methods.
As you're unlikely to write code that can accept values of any type this is rarely a problem in practice.

Assign any deferred nested attributes after the base attributes have been set.
Assign the adapter slot for each high-level network
Assign the rendered format to look up context.
Assign unique IDs to invocations of `cmd_output`.
Assigning the same value leaves the attribute unchanged:

Assigning to an existing column or row clobbers the data.
Assigning to an unused header appends the new pair.
Assigning to new columns creates them at the right end of the table.

Back transformation to get eigenvectors of original matrix
Backburner is a beanstalkd-powered job queue that can handle a very high volume of jobs.
Backtrace and config-file are added so they show up in the help commands.
Backtraces often include many lines that are not relevant for the context under review.
Backup everything if errors occured while migrating.

Basically there are two different styles:
Basically, calls Parent.replace_child
Batch file deletions, deleting over 130,000+ files will crash File.delete.
Be advised, RDoc will not detect delegated methods.
Be aware that these columns use a string keyed hash and do not allow access using a symbol.
Be aware that this causes the stream to be parsed up to the +depth+ event, so you can effectively pre-parse the entire document (pull the entire thing into memory) using this method.
Be aware that this method only returns the first Text node.
Be aware, though, that the objects will _not_ have their instance data returned to their pre-transactional state.
Be careful because this also means you're initializing a model object with only the fields that you've selected.
Be careful to sanitize the path parameter if it is coming from a web page.
Be careful when using the older argument style, as an extra literal hash is needed:
Be careful which directory is specified in your config file when using +FileStore+ because everything in that directory will be deleted.
Be careful with the paths
Be careful with this method since it could affect other processes if shared cache is being used.
Be careful you don't leave a quote unmatched.
Be conservative and return false if we're not sure
Be conservative and return true if we're not sure
Be lazy computing stuff to have as light impact as possible to the rest of tasks.

Be sure to declare +define_attribute_method+ after you define any prefix, suffix or affix method, or they will not hook in.
Be sure to declare +define_attribute_methods+ after you define any prefix, suffix or affix methods, or they will not hook in.
Be sure to include shadowed public instance methods of this class
Be sure to look at the documentation of those specific classes for more information.
Be sure to re-raise unhandled exceptions if this is what you expect.
Be sure to specify the same class as the +value_method+ when specifying selected or disabled options.
Be sure to stringify the id for routes
Be sure to use the same DigestAuth instance for multiple requests as it saves state between requests in order to perform authentication.
Be warned that this discards field order and clobbers duplicate fields.
Be warned that your attributes are not copied.
Bear in mind that GET and HEAD requests are not checked.
Because #bmbm takes two passes through the tests, it can calculate the required label width.
Because CookieStore extends Rack::Session::Abstract::Persisted, many of the options described there can be used to customize the session cookie that is generated.
Because callbacks are run in the order they are defined, associated objects may need to be explicitly saved in any user-defined +before_save+ callbacks.
Because chunked encoding is HTTP/1.1 feature, you must confirm the server to support HTTP/1.1 before sending it.
Because condition-wait loop is encapsulated in the Queue class (that in turn is oblivious to ConnectionPool implementation), threads that are "stuck" there are helpless.
Because irb evaluates input immediately after it is syntactically complete, the results may be slightly different than directly using Ruby.
Because it is silent.
Because it may be necessary to modify the body, Eg, decompression this method facilitates that.
Because of extended life of the previous cache, other processes will continue to use slightly stale data for a just a bit longer.
Because of how the rescue clauses come out of Parser, these are special and need to be tested.
Because of line breaks, we will only find the beginning.
Because of the way the CSV format works, it's common for a parser to need to read until the end of the file to be sure a field is invalid.
Because of this we need to update the version and publish at the same time.
Because of this, Active Record emulates nested transactions by using savepoints on MySQL and PostgreSQL.
Because of this, you probably only want to change delegation to objects of the same type as the original delegate.
Because the IMAP class uses Sockets for communication, its methods are also susceptible to the various errors that can occur when working with sockets.
Because the Logger's level is set to +WARN+, only the warning, error, and fatal messages are recorded.
Because the generated param begins with the record's +id+, it is suitable for passing to +find+.
Because the renderer inherits from `OpenStruct`, additional view variables can be added like normal accessors.
Because the user can switch the YAML engine behind our back, we have to check again here to make sure that our psych code was properly loaded, and load it if not.
Because this transformation is idempotent, this helper can be applied even if +ActiveSupport.escape_html_entities_in_json+ is already true.
Because we assumed all classes without a stated superclass inherit from Object, we have the above wrong inheritance.
Because you can instantiate multiple sessions and run them side-by-side, you can also mimic (to some limited extent) multiple simultaneous users interacting with your system.
Before and After hooks
Before callbacks should also be executed as early as possible, so also include them at the bottom.
Before changes, the floating point numbers will be interpreted as table names and will cause this to run in one query
Before each constant is removed a callback is sent to its class/module if it implements +before_remove_const+.
Before option processing in +rdoc+, RDoc::Options will call ::setup_options on the generator class with an RDoc::Options instance.
Before processing, set the request formats in current controller formats.
Before this is called, a plugin does not exist.
Begin sending keep-alive packets while we wait for the script to complete.

Besides the RDoc::Markup format, the following formats are built in to RDoc:
Besides the overwritable callback methods, it's also possible to register callbacks through the use of the callback macros.
Besides, if you fetch existing records with +select+ and leave the ID out, you're on your own, this predicate will return false.
Besides, integration tests are as fast as functional tests and provide lot of helpers such as +as+, +parsed_body+ for effective testing of controller actions including even API endpoints.

Built-in global variables are allowed by default.
Built-in support is provided for +FileStore+ (the default), +MemoryStore+, and +PStore+ (from cgi/session/pstore.rb).
Builtin contains middleware classes that are shipped with Vagrant-core and are thus available to all plugins as a "standard library" of sorts.
Bundler does this, so I guess we should as well, since I think it other subprocesses that use Bundler will reload it

Configure `config.ssl_options` with `hsts: false` to disable.
Configure a Vagrant environment.
Configure each network interface
Configure generators for API only applications.
Configure interfaces FIXME: fix matching of interfaces with IP adresses
Configure scripts generated by autoconf 2.61 or later export as_nl, which we use as a heuristic for running under configure
Configure sensitive parameters which will be filtered from the log file.
Configure the frequency by setting "reaping_frequency" in your database yaml file.
Configure your secret key in config/secrets.yml:
Configure your session store in config/initializers/session_store.rb:
Configures a provider for this VM.
Configures the encoding, verbosity, schema search path, and time zone of the connection.
Configures the given list of networks on the virtual machine.
Configures the specified interface for DHCP
Configures the specified interface using a static address
Configures two callbacks instead of a single after_save so that the model may rely on their execution order relative to its own callbacks.
Confusingly, executables (e.g. config scripts) are only found under /opt/X11/bin or /usr/X11/bin in all cases.
Connect to IO +tcp+, with context of the current certificate configuration
Connect to SCP and yield the SCP object
Connect to SSH, giving it a few tries
Connect to the database
Connect via SSH and execute the command in the shell.
Connect with native OpenSSH client Other modes (e.g. paramiko) are not officially supported, but can be enabled via raw_arguments option.
Connecting to the DB is done outside main synchronized section.
Connection details inside of the "url" key win any merge conflicts
Connection information make it better match lib/vagrant/util/ssh.rb command_options style and logic
Connection ownership is tracked by the +connection.owner+ attr on each +connection+ instance.
Connection pool allows for concurrent (outside the main +synchronize+ section) establishment of new connections.
Connection pool base class for managing Active Record database connections.
ConnectionHandler is a collection of ConnectionPool objects.
ConnectionPool is completely thread-safe, and will ensure that a connection cannot be used by two threads at the same time, as long as ConnectionPool's contract is correctly followed.
Connections can be obtained and used from a connection pool in several ways:
Connections in the pool are actually AbstractAdapter objects (or objects compatible with AbstractAdapter's interface).
Connects to a PostgreSQL server and sets up the adapter depending on the connected server's characteristics.
Consecutive lines starting at this margin are considered to be a paragraph.

Constant for relieving Ruby's garbage collector.
Constant of Encoding Auto-Detect
Constant or class methods
Constant time string comparison.
Constant values can be supplied on the first line of the comment like so:
Constants +PROMPT_I+, +PROMPT_S+ and +PROMPT_C+ specify the format.
Constants are defined in Logger namespace: +DEBUG+, +INFO+, +WARN+, +ERROR+, +FATAL+, or +UNKNOWN+.
Constants do not necessarily rely on digest/*.
Constants for use in #slugify
Constants like __FILE__ are handled as strings, but don't respond to begin.
Constants may only be regarded as 'new' once -- so if the block calls +new_constants_in+ again, then the constants defined within the inner call will not be reported in this one.
Constants that "depend" needs.
Constants that define a node's type
Constants that define types for IXMLElement.
Constraints can include the 'ignorecase' and 'extended syntax' regular expression modifiers:

Current limitations: - The installation of a specific Ansible version is not supported.
Currently Htgroup is not directly integrated with any authenticators in WEBrick.
Currently Net::IMAP supports the authentication mechanisms:
Currently implemented by belongs_to (vanilla and polymorphic) and has_one/has_many :through associations which go through a belongs_to.
Currently it checks for code like this:
Currently it doesn't track the status code.
Currently known values are "current" and "stable", but more may be added in the future.
Currently only RDoc::Extend and RDoc::Include are supported.
Currently only need to handle Cask deletion/migration.
Currently the OpenSSL bindings do not raise an error if auth_tag is truncated, which would allow an attacker to easily forge it.
Currently there is no direct API for dumping Ruby structure to file:
Currently this cop has advanced logic that detects unreferenced reassignments and properly handles varied cases such as branch, loop, rescue, ensure, etc.
Currently this fails because ActiveSupport::Multibyte::Unicode#tidy_bytes required a specific Encoding::Converter(UTF-8 to UTF8-MAC) which unavailable on JRuby causing our tests to error out.
Currently, if passed userinfo components this method generates invalid HTTP URIs as per RFC 1738.
Currently, this cop completely ignores strings with invalid encoding If it could handle them and still report an offense when appropriate, that would be even better
Currently, we use the Gauss-Bareiss algorithm
Currently, when an exception happens in development or production, Rails will automatically stream to the client:

Excess values are ignored and if the Array does not have a value for each row the extra rows will receive a +nil+.
Exclude cache, logs, and repository, if they are located under the prefix.
Exclude column attribute since MRI does not output column number.
Exclude entries from source directory
Exclude is always the last run filter, so if a file is matched in both include and exclude, it will be excluded.
Exclude properties in .rubocop_todo.yml override default ones, as well as any custom excludes in .rubocop.yml, so in order to retain those excludes we must copy them.
Exclude some files by default, and any that might be configured by the user.
Exclude the scope of the association itself, because that was already merged in the #scope method.
Excluded files will be removed later by the caller, but as an optimization find_files removes the top level directories that are excluded in configuration in the normal way (dir/**/*).

For example when this middleware receives a 500 response it will render the template found in `/public/500.html`.
For example you can define the following in your locale (e.g. en.yml)
For example you can define the following in your locale (e.g. en.yml).
For example you can't dup +nil+:
For example, "mount_nfs_folder" is a guest-OS specific operation, so capabilities defer these operations to the guest.
For example, "rails:model" should be searched in both: "rails/model/model_generator" and "rails/model_generator".
For example, 'Not Found'.
For example, +Post.all+ may return Comments, Messages, and Emails by storing the record's subclass in a +type+ attribute.
For example, +UsersController+ will try to find if the +User+ model exists.
For example, +auth_type+ will return the environment variable +AUTH_TYPE+, and +accept+ will return the value for +HTTP_ACCEPT+.
For example, AWS has no equivalent to "port forwarding." But most providers will attempt to implement this in a way that behaves similarly.
For example, If you wanted to create a +member+ named _joe_ and wanted to update the +posts+ at the same time, that would give an ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound error.
For example, MemCacheStore's #write method supports the +:raw+ option, which tells the memcached server to store all values as strings.
For example, Object.const_get('::String') raises NameError and so does qualified_const_get.
For example, Rails::Generators::ModelGenerator will return "model" as generator name.
For example, SQLite does not understand dates, so this method will convert a Date to a String.
For example, `lvar` and `send` type nodes are initially created as an `ident` type node and fixed to the appropriate type later.
For example, a +DiscussionBoard+ may cache posts_count and comments_count to avoid running an SQL query to calculate the number of posts and comments there are, each time it is displayed.
For example, a BlogPost model might return "blog_posts/blog_post".
For example, a fatal message for Ruby's Logger is considered an error for syslog(3).
For example, a key of "Content-Type" might return "text/html"
For example, a wrapper function getpid() could access the "real" getpid() with dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, "getpid").
For example, actions that could result in the rendering of different templates will use the manual rendering methods:
For example, after_commit is a good spot to put in a hook to clearing a cache since clearing it from within a transaction could trigger the cache to be regenerated before the database is updated.
For example, all linux-based systems should have similar communication (usually a shell).
For example, all of the following will be used as the :call-seq:
For example, an extension doing any of the following would need a railtie:
For example, digests produced by Digest::SHA256 will always be 32 bytes (256 bits) in size.

For example, here's a pattern of creating notifications when new comments are posted.
For example, if a bug is only triggered on GCC 4.8.1 but is not encountered on 4.8.2:
For example, if a bulleted list follows the first item is not rendered as a list item, but as a paragraph starting with a plain asterisk.
For example, if a class has a number of constants that you don't want to document, put a +:stopdoc:+ before the first, and a +:startdoc:+ after the last.
For example, if all the addressables are either of class Person or Company, then a total of 3 queries will be executed.
For example, if permalink_style contains a trailing slash (or is :pretty, which indirectly has a trailing slash), then so will the returned template.
For example, if the V1 superclass happens to be "Vagrant::V1," future versions of Vagrant may move it to "Vagrant::Plugins::V1" and plugins will not be affected.
For example, if the following templates exist: * signup_notification.text.erb * signup_notification.html.erb * signup_notification.xml.builder * signup_notification.yml.erb
For example, if the user invoke the controller generator as:
For example, if we have a +User+ model with +category_ids+ field and we have the following code in our update action:
For example, if we have the following:
For example, if we wanted it to be +user+ instead of +account+ we'd do:
For example, if you are attempting to get the current_scope for the +Board+ model, then you would use the following code:
For example, if you pass "test/foo" as a target name, your extension will be installed under the "test" directory.
For example, if you replace the +current_user.to_json+ in the example above with user input instead, the browser will happily eval() that string as JavaScript.
For example, if you serve pages tailored depending on who's logged in at the moment, you may want to add the current user id to be part of the ETag to prevent unauthorized displaying of cached pages.
For example, if you try to update the index of a search engine in +after_save+ the indexer won't see the updated record.
For example, if you want to check for +uniqueness+ with +hstore+ you will need to use a custom validation to handle it.
For example, if you want to set the HTTP response's content MIME type, then use ActionControllerBase#headers instead of Response#headers.
For example, if you wanted to treat all two digit years prior to 70 as the year 2000+ you could write this:
For example, if you're posting to +UsersController+, your new +params+ hash will look like this:
For example, if you've created a savepoint, then you execute a CREATE TABLE statement, then the savepoint that was created will be automatically released.
For example, if your C extension is defined as +Init_foo+, then your target would simply be "foo".
For example, imagine the following +dashboard+ action:
For example, in most cases you can use this to access +libc+ functions, or ruby functions like +rb_str_new+.
For example, in the controller you could write this:
For example, in the resource generator, the controller should be invoked with a pluralized class name.
For example, it can be implemented as follows using Ruby/ProgressBar.
For example, it might have the wrong data type for the column, or it might be out of range.
For example, let's say you made a helper to automatically add labels to form inputs.
For example, lines like "else do_something".
For example, making sure that a teacher can only be on the schedule once per semester for a particular class.
For example, parameters passed to +url_for+ in Rails will eventually call Formatter#generate.
For example, parent directories should not be owned by untrusted users, and should not be world writable except when the sticky bit set.
For example, parsing non-quoted fields is as easy as:
For example, setting the IDs of a child collection.
For example, shoulda is considered a test_framework and is an extension of test_unit.
For example, something like
For example, specifying +:books+ allows this method to preload all books for an Author.
For example, suppose a person has many projects, and each project has many tasks.
For example, suppose that two users try to post a Comment at the same time, and a Comment's title must be unique.
For example, suppose that you have 5 models, with the following hierarchy:
For example, test_accept_blank_line sets up a RDoc::Markup::BlockLine then calls accept_blank_line on your visitor.
For example, the abbreviation "CST" is used variously as:
For example, the above header was obtained with:
For example, the built-in converters will try to transcode data to UTF-8 before making conversions.
For example, the call above is converted to:
For example, the following association would find all events that occur on the user's birthday:
For example, the following behavior may be surprising:
For example, the following code checks the connection for each 60 seconds.
For example, the following database.yml...
For example, the following demo integration test prints the body of the controller response to the console:
For example, the following would not work following the previous example:
For example, the following:
For example, the number 123.45 has a precision of 5 and a scale of 2.
For example, the previous example could be rewritten as:
For example, the rake gem has rake as an executable.
For example, the tables "catalog_categories" and "catalog_products" generate a join table name of "catalog_categories_products".
For example, these two snippets have the same output:
For example, this method could generate the following:

For example, to add a condition:
For example, to allow Date deserialization:
For example, to compare ways to sort an array of floats:
For example, to detect when the server sends a new EXISTS response (which normally indicates new messages being added to the mailbox), add the following handler after selecting the mailbox:
For example, we could add WikiWords using something like:
For example, webrat developers might want to have webrat available on controller generator.
For example, when RuboCop inspects 2 files, the invocation order should be like this:
For example, when there are two placeholders with only one value supplied:
For example, when you have defined `MyCustomFormatter` in `./path/to/my_custom_formatter.rb`, you would type this command:
For example, with the following models:
For example, you can also do this:
For example, you can use that when manually building SQL strings:
For example, you could do this in your controller to rollback a transaction:
For example, you may want to prefix all fragment cache keys with a global version identifier, so you can easily invalidate all caches.
For example, you might want to set some session properties before sending a GET request.
For example, you might write:
For example, you would override #send_action if you want to inject arguments into the method.
For example, you've probably had the chance to write code like this in one of your views:
For examples of other protocols, see DRbUNIXSocket in drb/unix.rb, and HTTP0 in sample/http0.rb and sample/http0serv.rb in the full drb distribution.
For examples, see ValidEncoding below.
For exploded style (default), it recommends passing the exception class and message to `raise`, rather than construct an instance of the error.
For floats use assert_in_delta.
For floats use refute_in_delta.
For formulae migrated to cask: Auto-install cask or provide install instructions.
For forwarded ports, set the default ID to the host port so that host ports overwrite each other.
For full-class delegation via DelegateClass, see +delegate.rb+.
For further configuration details see RDoc::Task.
For gem developer documentation see:
For hash conditions, you can either use the table name in the key, or use a sub-hash.
For historical reasons, the 'media' attribute will always be present and defaults to "screen", so you must explicitly set it to "all" for the stylesheet(s) to apply to all media types.

For instance if the template the collection renders is cached like:
For instance methods the class name is used if +context+ does not match the parent.
For instance, "1 minute" is actually 30s to 1m29s.
For instance, a time + 24.hours will advance exactly 24 hours, while a time + 1.day will advance 23-25 hours, depending on the day.
For instance, a time - 24.hours will go subtract exactly 24 hours, while a time - 1.day will subtract 23-25 hours, depending on the day.
For instance, an HTTP controller with a template matching the action name is considered to exist.
For instance, any method that involves sending a request to the server and/or receiving a response from it could raise an Errno::EPIPE error if the network connection unexpectedly goes down.
For instance, if we have the following template:
For instance, if you want to have a development set of documentation including private methods:
For instance, in a production system, you may have your Logger set to +INFO+ or even +WARN+.
For instance, in order to change the routes to allow for a dot character in the +id+ parameter:
For instance, let's store all "render" events in an array:
For instance, suppose the request contains the parameter "favourite_colours" with the multiple values "blue" and "green".
For instance, take the following tests:
For instance, the default prompt mode is defined as follows:
For instance, the template above using +provide+ would be:
For instance, you can figure out the name of a table from the name of a class.
For instance: +json+ and +jsonb+ types in PostgreSQL will be converted between JSON object/array syntax and Ruby +Hash+ or +Array+ objects transparently.
For just one comment:
For machine-readable output, set the prefix in the options hash and continue it on.
For machine-readable output.
For many resources, loose upgrades are sufficient: if a thread is awaiting a lock, it is not running any other code.
For modern shells (e.g. bash, zsh, etc.), you can use shell completion for command line options.
For more advanced details on the implementation see Psych, and also check out http://yaml.org for spec details and other helpful information.

For most adapters this means all #tables and #views.
For multi-line strings that only have quote marks at the beginning of the first line and the end of the last, the begin and end region of each child is nil.
For namespaced routes, like +admin_post_url+:
For now I'm assuming that I can substitute a character in the range 0..8 for a 7 bit character without damaging the encoded string, but this might be optimistic ++
For now this documents existing behavior.
For now we're not interested in additional capability bits also to be found in the `cpusubtype` field.
For now, action_controller must always be present with Rails, so let's make sure that it gets required before here.
For now, only check the description when using `--strict`
For now, the user has to synchronize the schema manually.
For now, we assume that lists are 2 items or less.
For now, we only check that we don't crash.
For older versions you can use the queue_classic-later gem.
For one-to-one nested associations, if you build the new (in-memory) child object yourself before assignment, then this module will not overwrite it, e.g.:
For optimistic locking
For options that require an argument, option specification strings may include an option name in all caps.
For options, see +match+, as +mount+ uses it internally.
For options, see +match+, as +root+ uses it internally.
For other adapters you will have to parse the (database-specific) exception message to detect such a case.
For other stores the source is the path.
For performance critical pages, selecting only the required fields can be an easy performance win (assuming you aren't using all of the fields on the model).
For performance reasons, we don't check whether to validate at runtime.
For polymorphic relationships, find the foreign key and type: PriceEstimate.where(estimate_of: treasure)
For provisioners like chef-apply, these options are not valid
For queries selecting a subset of columns, return false for unselected columns.
For queries, CGI provides methods to get at environmental variables, parameters, cookies, and multipart request data.
For quick access to the `SSH` class.
For ranges with line breaks, we look a the last code line.
For redirects within the same controller, you can even call follow_redirect and the redirect will be followed, triggering another action call which can then be asserted against.
For regular "ups" create it and get the CID
For removing objects from the session, you can either assign a single key to +nil+:
For responses, CGI provides methods for writing output and generating HTML.
For ri, the server runs on port 8214 by default.
For run commands, we run it and stream back the output
For scope names which contain spaces this approach doesn't work.
For secure removing, read the documentation of #remove_entry_secure carefully, and set :secure option to true.
For security, the path for a digest password database should be stored outside of the paths available to the HTTP server.
For security, the path for a password database should be stored outside of the paths available to the HTTP server.
For server operations:
For short style, only portion matched to argument pattern is treated as argument.
For single line ranges, this is simple.
For single-table inheritance, we check the record for a +type+ column and return the corresponding class.
For some background, Vagrant needs to set the value of these variables to nil to force new specs to be loaded.
For some reason our test passes on Windows, so just short circuit because we're not Windows.
For some reason, this returns status 1...
For some session storage types, this is a no-op.
For standard installs, :    the `prefix` and `repository` are the same directory.
For startup plists, we cannot tell whether it's running on launchd, as it requires for `sudo launchctl list` to get real result.
For streaming, instead of rendering a given a template, we return a Body object that responds to each.
For string and array conditions, use the table name in the condition.
For system ri store (the standard library documentation) the source is"ruby".
For testing layouts which are set automatically
For that we depend on the output.
For the +rdoc-label+ scheme the footnote and label prefixes are stripped when creating a link.
For the +rdoc-ref+ scheme the named reference will be returned without creating a link.
For the Docker provider
For the default 'aes-256-cbc' cipher, this is 256 bits.
For the families available for +host+, returns a TCPServer on +port+.
For the last example, single-digit versions are automatically extended with a zero to give a sensible result.
For the list of those files and their copying conditions, see the file LEGAL.
For the lower components, the minimum values (1 or 0) are assumed if broken or missing.
For the rdoc-ref scheme the cross-reference will be looked up and the given name will be used.
For the rest of this documentation, when we say "UTF-8", we mean "UTF-8 or whatever the default_internal encoding is set to".
For the second way, use #has_and_belongs_to_many in both models.
For the simple, default case, just copy it over.
For the structure of this hash read the accompanying documentation for this method.
For this pull request, which changes Page#dir https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/pull/4403
For this purpose, you can use a helper called +provide+ that does the same as +content_for+ but tells the layout to stop searching for other entries and continue rendering.
For this we inspect the output and determine if an error occurred.
For this, you need to create a config file as follow:
For those requests that do need to know the IP, the GetIp#calculate_ip method will calculate the memoized client IP address.
For use by formatters only (caches its result).
For use by the Gem.done_installing hook
For use with legacy gems.
For use/testing when no gem is installed Require all of the Ruby files in the given directory.

Hence, dynamic values in fixtures are to be considered a code smell.
Here RDoc will determine from the rb_define_method line that there's a method called "flatten" in class Array, and will look for the implementation in the method rb_ary_flatten.

However "can't resolve symbol 'dbm_clearerr'" problem may be caused by header/library mismatch: Berkeley DB ndbm.h and GDBM library until 1.8.3.
However actual outputs may overflow +maxwidth+ if long non-breakable texts are provided.
However all sockets in the result has same port number.
However if the +:dependent+ value is +:destroy+ then in that case the +:delete_all+ deletion strategy for the association is applied.
However it fails on Rubinius 2.2.9 due to its bug:
However it is not declared by ndbm.h until GDBM 1.8.3.
However the validation and callback methods are lazy and those methods get created when they are invoked for the very first time.
However we may well contain subdirectories which must be tested for .document files.
However you can still overwrite individual conventions, such as:
However, +mode+ must be read mode because OpenURI::OpenRead#open doesn't support write mode (yet).
However, PostgreSQL will cast the default to the columns type, which leaves us with a default like "default NULL::character varying".
However, a session id must be passed backwards and forwards between client and server to maintain a reference to this session state.
However, after insert_record has been called, the cache is cleared in order to allow multiple instances of the same record in an association.
However, an absence of a such mapping does not mean that the +thread+ doesn't own the said connection.
However, cleanup callbacks are not called until the request is fully complete -- that is, after #close has been called on the response body.
However, currently it's unclear whether there's a way to emit this warning without syntax errors.
However, doing this requires that every class that #inspect is called on implement #pretty_print, or a RuntimeError will be raised.
However, editline (NetBSD 6.1.3, 2014) doesn't have rl_hook_func_t.
However, if +content_for+ is called several times, the final result would have all calls concatenated.
However, if a block has been passed, that block will be passed the key and executed in the event of a cache miss.
However, if an object cannot be marshalled, a dRuby reference to it is passed or returned instead.
However, if the date component is not provided, but any other upper components are supplied, then the day of the month defaults to 1:
However, if there is a WHERE clause that spans across tables Active Record will fall back to a slightly more resource-intensive single query:
However, if we know that a certain node type (like `int`) never has child nodes, there is no reason to pay the cost of calling `super`.
However, if you don't need stderr output, you can use Open3.popen2.
However, if you want to place your generators at a different location, you can specify in your railtie a block which will load them during normal generators lookup:
However, in MySQL it is advised to add a compound index for both of the columns as MySQL only uses one index per table during the lookup.
However, it does not know what attributes are legal for which elements.
However, it is brave new code and may have some bugs.
However, it is not valid to have more than one radiobutton in a group checked.
However, it is possible to implement an alternative marshalling scheme as part of an implementation of the transport layer.
However, most part of shoulda generators are similar to test_unit ones.
However, newer versions of Rubygems try to map across that nil using a group_by clause, breaking things.
However, on Ruby 1.9.x on Windows, relative paths cause all C extension builds to fail.
However, since MySQL doesn't support DDL transactions, creating a table will result in any created savepoints to be automatically released.
However, some type of file-serialization trick would still be needed in order to enable calculating a single checksum over a directory.
However, sometimes you want to isolate your engine from the application, especially if your engine has its own router.
However, tests didn't show any noticeable speedup when doing this.
However, that would break proxy farms, where requests from a single user often go through different proxies in the farm.
However, the above applies if the parent model is being updated as well.
However, the buffer in a timeout session is kept for the next expect call.
However, the button tag does allow for richer labels such as images and emphasis, so this helper will also accept a block.
However, the following is true:
However, the full package also includes access control lists and the Rinda tuple-space distributed task management system, as well as a large number of samples.
However, the value is not a string, but an IO object, either an IOString for small files, or a Tempfile for larger ones.
However, there are examples where this strategy doesn't make sense.
However, they are supported by Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Safari.
However, this can change, for instance, when using nested attributes, which is called _after_ the association has been defined.
However, this does not allow for LIMIT, OFFSET and ORDER.
However, this limit can cause a legitimate parse to fail and thus is set to +nil+, or off, by default.
However, this results in a minor performance loss, and only works on platforms that support atomic file renames.
However, this works in many cases.
However, those can be customized:
However, unlink-before-close may not be supported on non-POSIX operating systems.
However, values passed to #update_all will still go through Active Record's normal type casting and serialization.
However, we can access instance variables with default value (nil).
However, we can't replace with each_with_object if the accumulator parameter is assigned to within the block.
However, when a layout is explicitly set, the explicitly set layout wins: * The InformationController uses the "information" layout, explicitly set.
However, when there is an error, the message is added to the password attribute instead so that the error message will make sense to the end-user.
However, while DBM only allows strings for both keys and values, this library allows one to use most Ruby objects for values by first converting them to YAML.
However, you can set these values manually in the target Encoding to avoid the translation.
However, you need to be aware when using +class_attribute+ with mutable structures as +Array+ or +Hash+.

I *think* they were just being defensive, but I have no idea.
I can't think of a better single regular expression or any faster way to do this.
I cheated by making the autotest parts not have ./
I did try to defer to the original interface whenever I didn't have a compelling reason to change it though, so hopefully this won't be too radically different.
I don't actually think it's possible to pass a Constraints object to this constructor, but there were multiple places that kept testing children of this object.
I don't know Ruby's spec about "unlink-before-close" exactly.
I don't know how to validate the final return value yet...
I don't think any of our existing classes are the right place though.
I have HOME, USERPROFILE and HOMEDRIVE + HOMEPATH.
I hope I can make more clean test on it.
I install "rdoc-3.12.gem", a package signed by "drbrain".
I looove users who give me unit tests.
I propose that it should fallback to USERPROFILE and HOMEDRIVE + HOMEPATH (at least on Win32).
I relax the rules in only one place and that is to make using this library easier.
I require to avoid warning more than once.
I strongly recommend this scheme.
I try to point out any other Encoding issues in the documentation of methods as they come up.
I typo this all the time
I used #encode64 instead of #b64encode (which allows a length arg) because b64encode is b0rked and ignores the length arg.
I want you to know that my team will keep working on the issues, especially:
I wish I knew why this line existed
I'm desperate for anything to make DTDs more palateable.
I'm not actually sure why they're still here
I'm sure I'll miss something, but I'll try to mention most of the major differences I am aware of, to help others quickly get up to speed:
I've seen guys that comment their code like this: This method....

IO.select invokes #to_io.
IO::WaitReadable is only available on Ruby 1.9+ An IO::WaitReadable means there may be more IO but this IO object is not ready to be read from yet.
IO::WaitReadable means SSL needs to read internally so read_nonblock should be called again when the underlying IO is readable.
IO::WaitReadable means SSL needs to read internally so write_nonblock should be called again after the underlying IO is readable.
IO::WaitWritable means SSL needs to write internally so read_nonblock should be called again after the underlying IO is writable.
IO::WaitWritable means SSL needs to write internally so write_nonblock should be called again after underlying IO is writable.

Ideally the function should return, but those tests take noticeable time (performance).
Ideally the hook adder could decide whether to be in the background or not, and what to call it.
Ideally this would, if only for symmetry's sake with other association types
Ideally, they should be based on real-world scenarios extracted from production applications.
Ideally, we calculate this relative to the project root.
Identical to CSV#convert(), but for header rows.
Identifies whether the class name of a record or class is uncountable.
If "SSL" was defined to be an acronym:
If #count is used with #distinct (i.e. `relation.distinct.count`) it is considered distinct.
If #where is called with multiple arguments, these are treated as if they were passed as the elements of a single array.

If the file is not in this gem, return nil.
If the file sets the +model_class+ and current instance value is not set, it uses the file value.
If the file starts with a byte order mark (BOM), the column can be non-zero, but then we find out here if there's no space to the left of the first token.
If the file wasn't unlinked because #unlink failed, then this method will attempt to do so again.
If the filename ends with .gz not preceded by .tar then we want to gunzip but not tar
If the files has not been modified since the time in the header a Not Modified response will be returned.
If the first argument is a String, then this must also be a String, and is the content of the attribute.
If the first argument is a string that begins with xxx://, it is parsed by URI.parse.
If the first argument is not a Symbol, then it will simply be returned:
If the first argument of add_option is a Symbol, it's used to group options in output.
If the first argument responds to the 'open' method, 'open' is called on it with the rest of the arguments.
If the first is specified, the Product class will look for "productid" instead of "id" as the primary column.
If the first line contains :section:, strip it and use the rest.
If the first unsuccessful match takes place after one or more successful matches have already taken place, the returned array will contain the results of those successful matches.
If the flush parameter is true content_for replaces the blocks it is given.
If the format is unknown, "rdoc" format is used.
If the formula name doesn't exist any more then complain but don't stop installation from continuing.
If the formula name is a fully-qualified name let's silently ignore it as we don't care about things used in taps that aren't currently tapped.
If the formula was pinned, and we were force-upgrading it, unpin and pin it again to get a symlink pointing to the correct keg.

If the klass has no documentable items the class is added to +also_in+ instead.
If the last argument is a String, it will be used as the error message.
If the last node is or contains a conflicting HEREDOC, we don't want to adjust the brace layout because this will result in invalid code.
If the last parameter, opts, is a Hash, it is recognized as an option for Process.spawn.
If the last response was not a redirect, an exception will be raised.
If the latter is specified, the Product class will look for "product_id" instead of "id".
If the length returned is larger than our buffer length, it is the API telling us it needs more space.
If the local address is not suitable for connect, SocketError is raised.
If the lock cannot be acquired, then nil is returned.
If the lock file is missing no LockSet is constructed.
If the logger's level is +INFO+ or higher, no debug messages will be logged, and the entire block will not even be evaluated.
If the machine ID changed, then we need to rebuild our underlying driver.
If the machine explicitly said NFS is not supported, then it isn't supported.
If the machine folder is not a directory then we just return an empty array since no active machines exist.
If the machine has a wait for reboot functionality, then do that (primarily Windows)
If the machine is not at a point where SSH is even possible, then `nil` should be returned.
If the machine isn't created, then our ID is stale, so just mark it as not created.
If the match fails, `nil` will be returned.
If the match succeeds, the return value depends on whether a block was provided to `#match`, and whether the pattern contained any "captures" (values which are extracted from a matching AST.)
If the method has no assigned name, it extracts it from #call_seq.
If the method is private or undefined, a NameError is thrown.
If the method that is chained on the do...end block is itself a method with a block, we allow it.
If the method's parameters were given by +call-seq+ it is preferred over the parsed values.
If the model is new, a record gets created in the database, otherwise the existing record gets updated.
If the name does not end in "local" no records will be returned.
If the name is the automatically assigned name, then replace the "/" with "-" because "/" is not a valid character for a docker container name.
If the name we're looking for contains no punctuation, we look for it up the module/class chain.
If the network is DHCP, then we have to start the dhclient, unless it is already running.
If the next id was calculated in advance (as in Oracle), it should be passed in as +id_value+.
If the node is inside a block, it makes no difference if that block is an argument in a method call.
If the node matches, and no block is provided, the new method will return the captures, or `true` if there were none.
If the node-set is empty, an empty string is returned.
If the number of missing gems are above this threshold value, then a bulk download technique is used.

If the object is already in the set, returns nil.
If the object is invalid, the saving will fail and false will be returned.
If the object is not in the set, returns nil.
If the object is not persisted, a form for that object, for instance, will route to the create action.
If the object responds to +to_partial_path+, then +to_partial_path+ will be called and will provide the path.
If the object responds to the method the call is attempted and +ArgumentError+ is still raised in case of argument mismatch.
If the optional +filename+ parameter is provided, then it is read in and parsed via #parse_config.

If the owner is a new record then foreign_key must be present in order to load target.
If the package is not available as a gem, return nil.
If the parallel assignment uses a rescue modifier and it is the only contents of a method, then we want to make use of the implicit begin
If the parsed object responds to the 'open' method, 'open' is called on it with the rest of the arguments.
If the passed value is +true+, the methods are prefixed/suffixed with the name of the enum.
If the path contains Cygwin, we just assume we're in Cygwin.
If the path contains a Windows short path, then we attempt to expand.
If the path is just a drive letter, then return that as-is
If the path supplied is absolute, it will be escaped in order to make it absolute in the URI.
If the paths are just strings, assume they are 'host' paths (rather than guest)
If the plugin's spec includes a post-install message display it
If the port is in use, then we can't use this either...
If the port is open (listening for TCP connections)

If the provider is already installed, then our work here is done
If the provider is not installed and Vagrant determines it is able to install this provider, then it will do so.
If the provider returns nil, then the machine is simply not ready for SSH, and we return nil as well.
If the proxy class doesn't respond to a certain method, it's forwarded to the encapsulated string.
If the proxy requires authentication you must supply it by hand.
If the read byte buffer is not empty, read_nonblock reads from the buffer like readpartial.
If the read(2) call does not complete within this time, a Net::ReadTimeout is raised.
If the record is new or it has changed, returns true.
If the record no longer exists in the database ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound is raised.
If the reference is found and +name+ is not documented +text+ will be returned.
If the referenced object is located within the local server, then the object itself is returned.
If the relation is the result of a join, you may create a condition which uses any of the tables in the join.
If the request doesn't match the options provided, the request is considered stale and should be generated from scratch.
If the response was not successful, shows an error to the user including the +error_prefix+ and the response body.
If the result is nil, then the machine is telling us that it is not yet ready for SSH, so we raise this exception.
If the result is true then check for the select case.
If the retries run out, the final exception is raised.
If the schema is not specified as part of +name+ then it will only find tables within the current schema search path (regardless of permissions to access tables in other schemas)
If the second is omitted then '0.0.0.0' is used.
If the second is omitted then '::1' is used.
If the second parameter is left off, then Dependencies will construct a set of names that the file at +path+ may define.
If the second token is a comment, that means that a line break follows, and that the rules for space inside don't apply.
If the shared folder is disabled then don't worry about validating it
If the signer has no key only the checksum file is added.
If the silencer returns +true+ for a given line, it will be excluded from the clean backtrace.

If the string is not in a Unicode Encoding, then an Exception is raised.
If the subject has interpolations, you can pass them through the +interpolations+ parameter.
If the subnet mask is equal to /32, don't output it
If the subnets overlap in any way then the host only network will not work because the routing tables will force the traffic onto the real interface rather than the VirtualBox interface.
If the table name is not prefixed with a schema, the database will take the first match from the schema search path.
If the target is +nil+ and does not respond to the delegated method a +NoMethodError+ is raised, as with any other value.
If the template engine handles encodings, we send the encoded String to the engine without further processing.
If the template was not compiled yet, it is done exactly before rendering.
If the temporary path exists, verify it is not too old.
If the third is omitted then 0 (default interface) is used.
If the thread had an error, then store the error to show later
If the time deltas were processed first, the following datetimes would be advanced to 2010/04/01 instead.
If the timeout expires or eof is found, nil is returned or yielded.
If the type is prefixed with a scope operator then we assume that the type_name is an absolute reference.
If the upper components of the given time are broken or missing, they are supplied with those of +now+.
If the user accepts, the form is processed normally, otherwise no action is taken.
If the user accepts, the link is processed normally, otherwise no action is taken.
If the user didn't install the helper tools and installed Xcode in a non-conventional place, this is our only option.
If the user didn't specify an encoding, and the handler handles encodings, we simply pass the String as is to the handler (with the default_external tag)
If the user has asked for the gem to be installed in a directory that is the system gem directory, then use the system bin directory, else create (or use) a new bin dir under the gem_home.
If the user has explicitly decided to NOT raise errors, pass that option to I18n.
If the user has run `vagrant login`, this will use that token.
If the user is given a way to change their locale, they will also be able to change the relative value of the currency displayed with this helper.
If the user is using TextMate or Sublime Text, give a nice project view instead.
If the user passes any flags that trigger building over installing from a bottle, they are collected here and returned as an Array for checking.
If the user's umask is more restrictive, respect that by masking out the corresponding bits.
If the value class doesn't support this convention then #composed_of allows a custom constructor to be specified.
If the value is :schema_search_path (the default), any schemas listed in schema_search_path are dumped.
If the value is nil or false, application don't expects SCM_RIGHTS control message.
If the value type is REG_EXPAND_SZ, environment variables are replaced.
If the value type is REG_EXPAND_SZ, returns value data whose environment variables are replaced.
If the value type is neither REG_SZ, REG_MULTI_SZ, REG_DWORD, REG_DWORD_BIG_ENDIAN, nor REG_QWORD, TypeError is raised.
If the values type does not match, TypeError is raised.
If the various assert methods are not sufficient, then you may use this object to inspect the HTTP response in detail.
If the verb is not GET or POST, which are natively supported by HTML forms, the form will be set to POST and a hidden input called _method will carry the intended verb for the server to interpret.
If the verify_mode is not VERIFY_NONE and ca_file, ca_path and cert_store are not set then the system default certificate store is used.
If the write buffer is not empty, it is flushed at first.
If there are method calls chained to the right hand side of the assignment, we let rhs be the receiver of those method calls before we check if it's an if/unless/while/until.
If there are method calls chained to the right hand side of the assignment, we let rhs be the receiver of those method calls before we check its indentation.
If there are more blocks in the chain, they will be found by subsequent calls to on_block.
If there are multiple field with same field name, the field values are concatenated with a comma.
If there are multiple hits for the search term, they are presented as a list with links.
If there are multiple proxies, that header may contain a list of IPs.

If there are no directly unresolved gems, then try and find +path+ in any gems that are available via the currently unresolved gems.
If there are no errors, an empty hash is returned.
If there are no parentheses around the arguments, then braces and do-end have different meaning due to how they bind, so we allow either.
If there are no unresolved deps, then we can use just try normal require handle loading a gem from the rescue below.
If there are none to keep, returns nil.
If there are other threads or processes there is a race condition between both calls and it could be the case that you end up with two similar records.
If there are parentheses around the block, check if that is being used.
If there doesn't exist a constant at the given path, an ArgumentError is raised.

If there is no current server, this returns the default configuration.
If there is no dynamic IP on the adapter, it doesn't matter.
If there is no known diff command or if it doesn't make sense to diff the output (single line, short output), then it simply returns a basic comparison between the two.

If there was an error running VBoxManage, show the error and the output.
If there were warnings or errors we want to output them
If there will be no +:tablet+ variant declared, +:phone+ variant will be picked:
If there's a match, it sends the matched string to the handler associated with the FormatSpecifier.
If there's no .rubocop.yml there either, the path to the default file is returned.
If these are the root synced folders (attached directly) to the Vagrantfile, then we mark it as such.
If these cops try to autocorrect the same file at the same time, bad things are liable to happen
If these requires were at the top of the file the constant would not be defined by the time their files were loaded.
If they are both set, it means that either:
If they are not 0600 an error message is displayed and RubyGems aborts.
If they are not already present, the formula will probably fail :    to install.
If they asked for a specific snapshot, it is an error
If they define the #investigate method, all input parameters passed to the commissioner will be passed to the cop too in order to do its own processing.
If they do have such a constant, then this const_missing must be due to from_mod::const_name, which should not return constants from from_mod's parents.
If they do not match, version of the value specified in this attribute will be installed over top of the existing version (a warning will be displayed).
If they don't, a MissingTagError will be raised.
If they match, no action is taken.
If they want JavaScript, then it is an Ajax request and we render the JavaScript template associated with this action.
If this action doesn't exist on the provider, then an exception must be raised.
If this attribute is set to a non-default value, it will be included in the filename of the gem when it is built such as: nokogiri-1.6.0-x86-mingw32.gem
If this block takes two arguments, then we curry it and store the configuration override for use later.

If this fails, then try it as a plain text password.
If this file has not been modified, set the regeneration bit to false
If this folder already exists, then we don't share it, it means it was already put down on disk.
If this formula conflicts with another one.
If this formula isn't the current target of the alias, it doesn't make sense to say that other formulae are older versions of it because we don't know which came first.
If this formula was installed with an alias that has since changed, then it was specified explicitly in ARGV.
If this is a *nix command (which we know about) with no Windows equivilant, assume failure
If this is a *nix command with no Windows equivilant, don't run it

If this is not provided, then a generic X509 is generated, with a correspond :SSLPrivateKey
If this is our scope, then override
If this is set to `true`, then the DNS proxy will not be enabled, and it is up to the end user to do it.
If this is set, "image" should not be set.
If this is set, Text nodes which contain only whitespace will not be added to the document tree.
If this is set, then the snapshot must already exist.
If this is the case, then Vagrant will set the ID to nil which will automatically clean out the machine data directory.
If this is the content, it must be fully normalized (contain no illegal characters).
If this is the first instance of Syslog::Logger, +program_name+ may be set to change the logged program name.
If this is true, then Vagrant can do a bunch more things like setting the hostname, provisioning, etc.
If this isn't HTTP, then don't do the HEAD request
If this isn't a directory then it isn't a machine
If this isn't a directory then it isn't a provider
If this isn't given, then whatever provider the box represents will be added.

If this offense is within a line range that is already being realigned by autocorrect, we report the offense without autocorrecting it.
If this option is not passed, the previous default value (if any) will be used.
If this returns `true`, then this class will be used as the primary communication method for the machine.
If this returns true, then all the other methods for communicating with the machine are expected to be functional.
If this routine sets up compression, then it does the decompression also, removing the header as well to prevent confusion.
If this test doesn't pass something may be very wrong.
If this value is `false` (the default), a ClientDisconnected exception will be raised.
If this value is `true`, calling `write` after the client disconnects will result in the written content being silently discarded.
If this value is false, the string may contain any characters, and REXML will escape any and all defined entities whose values are contained in the text.
If this value is nil (the default), then the raw value of the parent will be used as the raw value for this node.
If this version is not the current version, then we need to upgrade to the latest version.

If using Active Record's time zone support configure the connection to return TIMESTAMP WITH ZONE types in UTC.
If using a fully-scoped reference, check if the formula can be resolved.
If using a stream, like `JSON.load(open('file'))`, it will need to call `#read` manually, like `JSON.parse(open('file').read)`.
If using threads and workers together the concurrency of the application would be max `threads` * `workers`.
If validations for any of the associations fail, their error messages will be applied to the parent.
If value is true (default), attempting to update a record will result in an error.
If vboxmanage returned VBOX_E_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND, then the vm truly does not exist.
If ver contains rc version, just ignored.
If want it to generate a generic certificate, the bare minimum is to provide the :SSLCertName
If we add it to the previous example:
If we already have a newer version in our list of installed, then ignore it
If we already have the key in our environment we assume the lock is held by our middleware stack already and we allow nesting.

If we care about active VMs only, then we check the state to verify the VM is running.
If we change string concatenation from plus to backslash, the string literal that follows must remain a string literal.
If we delete Cellar/newname, then Cellar/oldname symlink can become broken and we have to remove it.
If we deleted one of a person's tasks, we would probably not want the project to be deleted.
If we didn't find a result, then raise an exception, depending on if we got a component or not.
If we didn't find the uploader binary it is a critical error
If we didn't run on any machines, then exit status 1
If we didn't upgrade, then this is still safe because the helper will only delete the directory if it exists
If we disabled checkpoint via env var, don't run this
If we disabled folders, we have to delete some from the save, so we load the entire cached thing, and delete them.
If we disabled state and knowing what alerts we've seen, then disable the signature file.

If we have the correctly named key, copy it
If we have this machine in our index, load that.
If we haven't chosen yes, then ask the user via TTY
If we haven't defined a single VM, then we need to define a default VM which just inherits the rest of the configuration.
If we later find a superclass for a registered class with a nil superclass, we must honor it.
If we marked this folder to not auto sync, then don't do it.
If we need auth information, then ask the user.

If we reached this point then it didn't work out.
If we reached this point then we successfully connected

If we're using a pty we have to do a little dance to make sure we get all the output properly without the cruft added from pty mode.
If when this method returns, the machine's state isn't "powered_off," Vagrant will proceed to forcefully shut the machine down.
If wtype is specified, the value type is it.
If you absolutely must write from within a function use +concat+.
If you access the same Tempfile object from multiple threads then you should protect it with a mutex.
If you add a method, keep in mind two things: (1) the first argument will always be a list of nodes from which to filter.
If you are behind multiple proxy servers (like NGINX to HAProxy to Unicorn) then you should test your Rack server to make sure your data is good.
If you are handling large files or wish to implement a progress bar you can instead stream the body directly to an IO.
If you are having to call this function, you are likely doing something wrong.
If you are migrating code from 1.8 or earlier, you may have to change your code to comply with the new interface.
If you are only performing a few GET requests you should try OpenURI.
If you are upgrading an existing Rails 3 app, you should leave your existing secret_token in place and simply add the new secret_key_base.

If you build your gem it will automatically be signed.
If you call a complicated SQL query which spans multiple tables the columns specified by the SELECT will be attributes of the model, whether or not they are columns of the corresponding table.
If you care about that, then you need to explicitly drop or ignore those headers sometime before this middleware runs.
If you care to define how to move up and down in these cases, you should define the +up+ and +down+ methods as before.
If you change use_ssl value after session started, a Net::HTTP object raises IOError.
If you choose to name the composition the same as the attribute's name, it will be the only way to access that attribute.
If you decide to define multiple applications, then the first application that is initialized will be set to +Rails.application+, unless you override it with a different application.
If you decide to define rake tasks, runners, or initializers in an application other than +Rails.application+, then you must run them manually.
If you define a custom initialize you must call this method before #parse

If you do not want to use any test framework, you can do:
If you do not want to write the cache when the cache is not found, use #read_multi.
If you do pass a block, you can render specific templates of your choice:
If you do this, then Mail will take the file name and work out the mime type.
If you do this, you do not need to do anything else for things to "just work".
If you do, Rails will not try to encode the String into the default_internal, passing you the unaltered bytes tagged with the assumed encoding (from default_external).
If you don't explicitly unlink the temporary file, the removal will be delayed until the object is finalized.
If you don't have SSL certificates for each of the asset hosts this technique allows you to avoid warnings in the client about mixed media.
If you don't have a layout, just render the thing and concatenate the final result.
If you don't have a type column defined in your table, single-table inheritance won't be triggered.
If you don't have gettext gem, this method doesn't load .po file.
If you don't just want to parlay the broadcast unfiltered to the subscriber, you can also supply a callback that lets you alter what is sent out.

If you don't specify a +:startdoc:+ by the end of the container, disables documentation for the rest of the current file.
If you don't specify a pattern then the default will be used.
If you don't specify an endpoint, routes will be used as the default endpoint.
If you don't use a proxy, because you are hosted on e.g. Heroku without SSL, any client can claim to have any IP address by setting the X-Forwarded-For header.

If you feel that you need to inject dynamic values, then perhaps you should reexamine whether your application is properly testable.
If you file :    a bug report, you will likely be asked for this information if you do not :    provide it.
If you have a more-complex set of overrides you can use the :call-seq: directive: ++
If you have a nested route, such as +admin_workshop_path+ you'll have to call that explicitly (it's impossible for +url_for+ to guess that route).
If you have a stream that is related to a model, then the broadcasting used can be generated from the model and channel.
If you have a string in some other encoding, convert it first.
If you have an array of keys you want to limit to, you should splat them:

If you need to create the application database on another system, you should be using db:schema:load, not running all the migrations from scratch.
If you need to disable this for any reason (e.g. development) then you can use an +:if+ or +:unless+ condition.
If you need to disconnect a given connection, you can go through the RemoteConnections.
If you need to do more complex things with a default scope, you can alternatively define it as a class method:

If you need to use a MIME type which isn't supported by default, you can register your own handlers in +config/initializers/mime_types.rb+ as follows.
If you need to use dots as part of the +:id+ parameter add a constraint which overrides this restriction, e.g:
If you need to work on all current children, new and existing records, +load_target+ and the +loaded+ flag are your friends.
If you need unescaped contents, set this to false.
If you only have secret_token set, your cookies will be signed, but not encrypted.
If you override this method to handle additional cases, you may also provide a method (like _handle_method_missing) to handle the case.
If you pass a Symbol as the first argument, then a corresponding cache store class under the ActiveSupport::Cache namespace will be created.

If you would like to duplicate functionality of `gem` commands, use the classes they call directly.
If you'd like to read someone's RSS feed with your Ruby code, you've come to the right place.
If you'd like to write your own Formatter use RDoc::Markup::FormatterTestCase.
If you'd prefer to use numeric prefixes, you can turn timestamped migrations off by setting:
If you're implementing a basic host, you can probably ignore this.
If you're not going to be using any of the options like collections or layouts, you can also use the short-hand defaults of render to render partials.
If you're not streaming a broadcasting at the very moment it sends out an update, you will not get that update, even if you connect after it has been sent.
If you're on MySQL, then do not use Data Definition Language(DDL) operations in nested transactions blocks that are emulated with savepoints.
If you're packaging RubyGems or implementing Ruby you can change RubyGems' defaults.
If you're using named routes, they can be easily tested using the original named routes' methods straight in the test case.
If you're writing a text-output formatter use RDoc::Markup::TextFormatterTestCase which provides extra test cases.
If you're writing code like this you're doing it wrong
If you've renamed a method, or squeezed more lines out, go ahead and update this assertion.
If you've set specific values, they'll be left alone.
If your JSON is being used downstream for insertion into the DOM, be aware of whether or not it is being inserted via +html()+.
If your POP server provides UIDL functionality, you can grab only selected mails from the POP server.
If your Ruby is ruby18, foo_exec will be installed as foo_exec18.
If your block takes two arguments, it will also be passed a CSV::FieldInfo Struct, containing details about the field.
If your cache is on a shared infrastructure, you can define a namespace for your cache entries.
If your certificate is not self-signed (signed by a third party) RubyGems will attempt to load the certificate chain from the trusted certificates.
If your code is intended for general consumption, test with multiple database backends.
If your collection cache depends on multiple sources (try to avoid this to keep things simple), you can name all these dependencies as part of a block that returns an array:
If your data cannot be transcoded to UTF-8 the conversion will fail and the field will remain unchanged.
If your data cannot be transcoded to UTF-8 the conversion will fail and the header will remain unchanged.
If your database supports setting the isolation level for a transaction, you can set it like so:
If your environment matches this description and you cannot authenticate, try this rule in your Apache setup:
If your method manually calls a block instead of yielding or you want to override the discovered argument names use the :yields: directive:
If your prefix is in a standard location (ie, rubygems is installed where you'd expect it to be), then prefix returns nil.
If your proxies aren't removed, pass them in via the +custom_proxies+ parameter.
If your railtie has Rake tasks, you can tell Rails to load them through the method +rake_tasks+:
If your resource has associations defined, for example, you want to add comments to the document given that the routes are set correctly:
If your tables share a common prefix, it will only appear once at the beginning.
If your template cache depends on multiple sources (try to avoid this to keep things simple), you can name all these dependencies as part of an array:
If your type has the same name as a native type for the current adapter, an exception will be raised unless you specify an +:override+ option.
If your type is only meant to be used with a specific database adapter, you can do so by passing +adapter: :postgresql+.
If your type returns an object which could be mutated, you should override this method.
IfUnlessModifier depends on the configuration of LineLength.

In Rails, a resourceful route provides a mapping between HTTP verbs and URLs and controller actions.
In Rails, this is usually achieved by creating the form using +form_for+ and a number of related helper methods.
In Ruby 1.9.3, it effectively disables the `rescue`.
In Ruby, Symbol and String values are different, but Vagrant has to unify them for better user experience.
In RubyGems 2 and newer there is no extra work to sign a gem.
In a chain of method calls, we regard the top send node as the base for indentation of all lines following the first.
In a controller, for example:
In a fat file, this changes install names in all internal Mach-Os.
In a few cases, the helper proxies to 'controller' or request.
In a great majority of cases, this is what is wanted.
In a happier world, this would be an attr_accessor.
In a multi-threaded environment they should only be set once at boot-time and never mutated at runtime.
In a template for Advertiser#account:
In addition to a method's standard errors, a dRuby call may also raise one of the dRuby-specific errors, all of which are subclasses of DRb::DRbError.
In addition to its specific fields and methods, a Cookie instance is a delegator to the array of its values.
In addition to saving, it also destroys any associated records that were marked for destruction.
In addition to that, we add all our plugin dependencies.
In addition to the CSV instance methods, several IO methods are delegated.
In addition to the Rake targets generated by Rake::PackageTask, a Gem::PackageTask will also generate the following tasks:
In addition to the basic accessors, query methods are also automatically available on the Active Record object.
In addition to the validators that ship with OptionParser (String, Integer, Float, TrueClass, FalseClass, Array, Regexp, Date, Time, URI, etc.), RDoc::Options adds Path, PathArray and Template.
In addition to these specific assertions, you also have easy access to various collections that the regular test/unit assertions can be used against.
In addition to using the standard template helpers provided, creating custom helpers to extract complicated logic or reusable functionality is strongly encouraged.
In addition to wrapping libyaml, Psych also knows how to serialize and de-serialize most Ruby objects to and from the YAML format.
In addition, #format accepts the following extensions:
In addition, RDoc assumes by default that the C method implementing a Ruby function is in the same source file as the rb_define_method call.
In addition, a thread to wait for the started process is created.
In addition, both must be a regular expression or a proc or lambda, or else an exception will be raised.
In addition, default connection parameters of libpq can be set per environment variables.
In addition, it destroys all children that were marked for destruction with #mark_for_destruction.
In addition, it will destroy the association if it was marked for destruction with #mark_for_destruction.
In addition, it will destroy the association if it was marked for destruction.
In addition, old downloads from the Homebrew download-cache are deleted.
In addition, parameters can be marked as required and flow through a predefined raise/rescue flow to end up as a 400 Bad Request with no effort.
In addition, the verbatim text has been shifted left, so the amount of indentation of verbatim text is unimportant.
In addition, this allows a single partial to be used to generate form inputs for both edit and create forms.
In all cases, we transcode the resulting String to the UTF-8.
In almost all situations, you must provide a third argument to SMTP.start/SMTP#start.
In an autoloaded user.rb like this
In an isolated engine, the prefix will be omitted in url helpers and form fields, for convenience.
In another template for Advertiser#buy, we could have:
In any case the status flag is returned.
In any case, +preload_associations+ will preload the all associations records by flattening +records+.
In any case, all arguments (+*args+) will be passed to Tempfile.new.
In any case, all arguments (+*args+) will be treated as Tempfile.new.
In both cases, if an offset is negative, it is counted from the end of the string.
In both cases, nil is returned if there is no match.
In both cases, the +id+ and +class+ of the wrapping DOM element are automatically generated, following naming conventions encapsulated by the RecordIdentifier methods #dom_id and #dom_class:
In both instances, valid attribute keys are determined by the column names of the associated table -- hence you can't have attributes that aren't part of the table columns.
In bundler the require: option overrides the file to require during Bundler.require.
In case of a nested call, #transaction will behave as follows:
In case of nil parameter it sets the charset to utf-8.
In case the layout continues yielding, we need to resume the fiber until all yields are handled.
In case we get back a String from a handler that is not in BINARY or the default_internal, encode it to the default_internal
In case we're building docs in a background process, this method waits for that process to exit (or if it's already been reaped, or never happened, swallows the Errno::ECHILD error).
In case you don't trust RubyGems you can verify gem signatures manually:
In column mode, iteration will +yield+ two element tuples containing the column name and an Array of values for that column.
In concurrent programming, a monitor is an object or module intended to be used safely by more than one thread.
In contrast to the CyclomaticComplexity cop, this cop considers `else` nodes as adding complexity.
In day-to-day usage, every `vagrant` invocation typically leads to a single Vagrant environment.
In de/serialize we change `nil` to 0, so that we can allow passing `nil` values to `lock_version`, and not result in `ActiveRecord::StaleObjectError` during update record.
In each of these cases, the named routes remain the same as if you did not use scope.
In either case the merge respects the semantics of indifferent access.
In either case, the attribute is found by matching the attribute name to the argument, and then removed.
In environment mode we still need to specify a manifest file, if its not, use the one from env config if specified.
In general it is usually enough.
In general uses of dlerror(3) should call it before use it.
In general, a debugger is used to find bugs in your program, which often means pausing execution and inspecting variables at some point in time.
In general, an existing record may either be updated with the new set of attribute values or be replaced by a wholly new record containing those values.
In general, the number of queries will be 1 plus the number of associations named (except if some of the associations are polymorphic #belongs_to - see below).
In general, this means that templates will be UTF-8 inside of Rails, regardless of the original source encoding.
In general, this mechanism should only be used alongside, rather than as a replacement for, a good firewall.
In general, this module should not be included on its own, as it is usually included by url_helpers (as in Rails.application.routes.url_helpers).
In installing mode certain restrictions are ignored such as ruby version mismatch checks.
In invalid cases, an error from the database is thrown.
In later release, this module becomes a class.
In many cases this is preferable to inheritance, which gives us the entire old interface, even if much of it isn't needed.
In many cases you will want to wrap the above in another helper, so you could do something like the following:
In mixed mode an index is assumed to be a row reference while anything else is assumed to be column access by headers.
In most cases such calls can be replaced with an explicit array creation.
In most cases, fetching large number of records can be performed efficiently using the ActiveRecord::Batches methods.
In most cases, this argument can be left out.
In no case is the order of any siblings disturbed.
In normal cases, this method returns the same name as it receives.
In offense message, we want to show the assignment LHS rather than the entire assignment
In older Ruby versions, ie.
In older RubyGems versions, the environment variable GEM_SKIP could be used to skip activation of specified gems, for example to test out changes that haven't been installed yet.
In order for both of these features to be specified independently, both an object name (represented by either a symbol or string) and the object itself can be passed to the method separately -
In order for the associations to work as expected, ensure that you store the base model for the STI models in the type column of the polymorphic association.
In order to account for this, we convert `nil` to `NilClass`.
In order to be used by RDoc the parser needs to register the file extensions it can parse.
In order to benefit from streaming you would want to rewrite it as:
In order to change engine's priority you can use +config.railties_order+ in the main application.
In order to create your own custom inspector there are two things you should be aware of:
In order to customize the prompt, you can change the following Hash:
In order to deploy this code, we should be able to handle any unmasked tokens that we've issued without error.
In order to execute a command on your OS, you need to define it as a Shell method.
In order to override this behavior, take a look at the private method +read_attribute_for_serialization+.
In order to start signing your gems, you'll need to build a private key and a self-signed certificate.
In order to take advantage of NFS synced folders, some provider-specific assistance is required.
In order to test those situations, it may be necessary to require another library for the duration of one spec
In order to use DatabaseTasks, a few config values need to be set.
In order to use any of the customized resolvers above in a Rails application, you just need to configure ActionController::Base.view_paths in an initializer, for example:
In order to use instantiated fixtures with preloaded data, set +self.pre_loaded_fixtures+ to true.
In order to use streaming, you will need to use a Ruby version that supports fibers (fibers are supported since version 1.9.2 of the main Ruby implementation).
In order to use these methods to access fixtured data within your testcases, you must specify one of the following in your ActiveSupport::TestCase-derived class:
In order to use this library, you must first require it:
In order to use this method you must first require the PP module:
In order to use this method, you must require expect:
In order to use this module, all you need is to implement view_renderer that returns an ActionView::Renderer object.
In order to work with ActionController, a Context must just include this module.
In other cases, it won't match any style at all
In other words, associations which could also be represented as has_and_belongs_to_many associations.
In other words, if the Jaro distance is less than this value, JaroWinkler.distance returns the raw Jaro distance.
In other words, the perfect system will accept all compatible versions of the library and reject all incompatible versions.
In other words, the right side (description part) starts after +width+ columns.
In other words, we make the request so that it operates on a single entity's person.
In other words, we only want to resolve one symlink.
In our case, we're simply returning a String, so next we have the +:string_literal+ expression.
In particular, this function validates:
In previous versions of Ruby you would need to require 'net/https' to use HTTPS.
In rare circumstances you might need to access the mapping directly.
In rare instances, web servers or front proxies strip authorization headers before they reach your application.
In raw mode, special characters in text is not converted to or from entities.
In reality, though, there's only so much that #bmbm can do, and the results are not guaranteed to be isolated from garbage collection and other effects.
In some cases, like a single table inheritance setup, you might have a bunch of explicit dependencies.
In some cases, the code under test will happen to match an alternative style.
In some cases, you may want to provide a boolean hook.
In strict mode, you can produce this behavior by using INSERT IGNORE or UPDATE IGNORE.
In such a situation you must decide whether to leave that migration or rename the migration in the application and rerun copying migrations.
In such actions, you want to delay queries execution as much as you can.
In such cases, all you need to do is to call refresh passing in the view object.
In such cases, you don't want to do changes in place.
In tests you can simply pass the URL or named route to +get+ or +post+.
In that case +conn.owner+ attr should be consulted.
In that case it is preferable to either use +check_box_tag+ or to use hashes instead of arrays.
In that case, +options+ and the block will be used by #create_table.
In that case, +options+ and the block will be used by create_table.
In that case, +type+ and +options+ will be used by #add_column.
In that case, `safe_exec` automatically falls back to forking.
In that case, batch processing methods allow you to work with the records in batches, thereby greatly reducing memory consumption.
In that case, don't generate an error, just move on.
In that case, it'll work just like normal subclasses with no special magic for differentiating between them or reloading the right type with find.
In that case, the block will be used by #create_join_table.
In that case, the buffer will be grown until the message is not truncated.
In that case, the index'th child Element that has the supplied name will be returned.
In that case, we must force an "early" commit: we're about to freeze the headers, so this is our last chance.
In the Asset example, you'd need an +attachable_id+ integer column and an +attachable_type+ string column.
In the above block, a +FormBuilder+ object is yielded as the +person_form+ variable.
In the above case, because the controller was explicitly given, but no action, the action is implied to be "index", not the recalled action of "show".
In the above example, posts with no approved comments are not returned at all because the conditions apply to the SQL statement as a whole and not just to the association.
In the above example, the configuration from the first application was used to initialize the second application.
In the authentication filter:
In the case of _posts/es, 'es' is NOT added as a category.
In the case of a belongs_to relationship, an association key can be used to specify the model if an ActiveRecord object is used as the value.
In the case of a multi-machine environment, then this can potentially be nil if no primary machine is specified.
In the case of a multi-machine environment, then this is the machine that is marked as primary, or nil if no primary machine was specified.
In the case of a single-machine environment, this is just the single machine name.
In the case of context methods (such as position), the function should return an array with a value for each child in the array.
In the case of es/_posts, 'es' is added as a category.
In the case of rb_define_const, the definition and comment are in "/* definition: comment */" form.
In the case of the example above, the template would be fed +ad_iteration+.
In the case that an `upgrade` is called, this will never be called.
In the case we don't have a plugin that does this, then it will just return the same URLs.
In the context of execution taking place within the main thread of a dRuby server (typically, as a result of a remote call on the server or one of its objects), the current server is that server.
In the default mixed mode indices refer to rows and everything else is assumed to be a column header.
In the default mixed mode or row mode, iteration is the standard row major walking of rows.
In the default mixed mode, this method assigns rows for index access and columns for header access.
In the default mixed mode, this method returns rows for index access and columns for header access.
In the dynamically generated methods below, a call to `super` is used to continue iterating over the children of a node.
In the end it appends the regular report data in the clang style format.
In the event the specified _name_ is not found in the data store, your _default_ will be returned instead.
In the example above +render+ is the name of the event, and the rest is called the _payload_.
In the example above, if the format is xml, it will render:
In the examples above, the object to be created or edited was represented by a symbol passed to +form_for+, and we noted that a string can also be used equivalently.
In the following example the Post model has many Comments stored within it in a NoSQL database, thus there is no primary key for comments.
In the following example, the looping on users will always be done when the three columns 'first_name', 'last_name' and 'full_name' exist, even when migrating down:
In the former form, the temporary file's base name will begin with the given string.
In the future we will want to do more fine-grained unlocking in actions themselves but for a 1.6.2 release this will work.
In the future, this might become an optional require.
In the last case only, we continue.
In the last case, the following paths map to +PostsController+:
In the latter form, the temporary file's base name will begin with the array's first element, and end with the second element.
In the meantime that first process will go ahead and will write into cache the new value.
In the methods below:
In the normal case the loop is only executed once.
In the opposite direction, when using Psych.dump, the Ruby object graph is translated to an intermediary AST which is then converted to a YAML document.
In the previous example, +s+ would take you inside the method definition of +get_foo+.
In the prompt specification, some special strings are available:
In the rare case that a race condition occurs, the database will guarantee the field's uniqueness.
In the rare situation when the user has indeed a downcased and an upcased dir (e.g. /TMP and /tmp) this check falsely thinks it is case-insensitive but we don't care because: 1.
In the simple case, MySQL allows us to place JOINs directly into the UPDATE query.
In the syntax specification below, the delimiter used with the "#" construct is a single space (SPACE).
In these cases, the opened file object is extended by OpenURI::Meta.
In these cases, the variable `foo` is not explicitly referenced, but it can be considered used implicitly by the `super` or `binding`.
In these cases, we just exit immediately.
In these cases, you can mix ERB in with your YAML fixtures to create a bunch of fixtures for load testing, like:
In these examples, we have three implicit lookup scenarios: * The BankController uses the "bank" layout.
In this case "kind" is "before" and "name" is "save".
In this case +last_modified+ will be set by calling +maximum(:updated_at)+ on the collection (the timestamp of the most recently updated record) and the +etag+ by passing the object itself.
In this case +last_modified+ will be set by calling +updated_at+ and +etag+ by passing the object itself.
In this case Rails will simply infer the appropriate URL from the record itself.
In this case it deletes all the entries in the specified file store directory except for .keep or .gitkeep.
In this case the hash maps a pattern to the attribute character
In this case the machine can be considered an "orphan." Determining which machines are orphan and which aren't is not currently a supported feature, but will be in a future version.
In this case, #where must be chained with #not to return a new relation.
In this case, Chef will use whatever version is on the system.
In this case, Dir.mktmpdir doesn't remove the directory.
In this case, alias is called with "ponies".
In this case, if you use this:
In this case, it is usually more natural to include an association which has conditions defined on it:
In this case, make sure you return a String from your handler encoded in the default_internal.
In this case, options are specified as an array of values as described above, with the hash key of "VALUES".
In this case, recvmsg closes the passed file descriptors immediately.
In this case, recvmsg creates IO objects for each file descriptors for Socket::AncillaryData#unix_rights method.
In this case, the Vagrant installer actually knows what the original environment was and replaces it completely.
In this case, the ancestor that has no parent acts as the root node.
In this case, the next Text child becomes the first Text child.
In this case, the read(2) system call is not called.
In this case, the return value of this method is the return value of the block.
In this case, there must be a +type+ column in the posts table.
In this case, try again without resume.
In this case, we tell the user.
In this case, you can use a singular resource to map /profile (rather than /profile/:id) to the show action.
In this case, you can use a singular resource to map /profile (rather than /profile/:id) to the show action:
In this case, you might want to use Shellwords.escape, or its alias String#shellescape.
In this context +:kind+ and +:name+ have special meanings: +:kind+ refers to the kind of callback (before/after/around) and +:name+ refers to the method on which callbacks are being defined.
In this context, 'Unicode Encoding' means any of  UTF-8, UTF-16BE/LE, and UTF-32BE/LE, as well as GB18030, UCS_2BE, and UCS_4BE.
In this description, 'association name' shall refer to the name passed to an association creation method.
In this example a +balance+ record is transactionally saved even though #transaction is called on the +Account+ class:
In this example archived articles are not being taken into consideration when validating uniqueness of the title attribute:
In this example we used the literal shortcut for Array.new.
In this example we will create three +tmpFile+'s in three different folders under the +/tmp+ directory.
In this example we will read the operating system file +/etc/printcap+, generated by +cupsd+, and then output it to a new file relative to the +pwd+ of +sh+.
In this example, if any before validate callbacks returns +false+, any successive before and around callback is not executed.
In this example, it'd be interesting to move to the next line and inspect the value of +foo+ again.
In this example, the :iphone format will be used if it's available, otherwise it'll fallback to the :html format.
In this example, the auto-correction (changing "fail" to "raise") creates a new problem (alignment of parameters), which is also corrected automatically.
In this form, the PR may be on Homebrew/brew, :        Homebrew/homebrew-core or any tap.
In this mode, it reads its parameters from the command line or (failing that) from standard input.
In this respect they are analogs of ActionDispatch::Callback's before and after callbacks.
In this scenario, the delete method won't actually work: it can only be used if the association on the join model is a belongs_to.
In this usage, the argument passed to the block (+format+ above) is an instance of the ActionController::MimeResponds::Collector class.
In this way the server can limit the time of the nonce's validity.
In this way, the last set data for a given name wins.
In those cases, we'll set up a simple mock
In those cases, you can resort to named bind variables instead.
In verbatim text, two or more blank lines are collapsed into one, and trailing blank lines are removed:
In verbose mode, failed calls are logged to stdout.
In versions after 1.9.3, a `TypeError` is thrown when the statement is rescued.
In which case we should just eager load them.
In which case, define them below.
In your ERB templates, use this method to escape any unsafe content.
In your integration tests, you can do something like this:
In-memory session storage class.
Include +obj+ in the objects to be pretty printed, and increment this Text object's total width by +width+
Include any trailing whitespace so we don't create a syntax error.
Include in a cookie jar to allow chaining, e.g. cookies.permanent.signed
Include the built-in modules so that we can use them as top-level things.
Include the built-in modules so we can use them as top-level things.
Include the default authenticity_token, which is only generated when its set to nil, but we needed the true value to override the default of no authenticity_token on data-remote.
Include this module in a RDoc::Parser subclass to make it show up as a file, not as part of a class or module.
Include this so we can use `Subprocess` more easily.
Include user ID in the path to make sure the user has write access.
Included in the Action Pack is the Action View, which enables rendering of ERB templates.
Includes +url_for+ into the host class (e.g. an abstract controller or mailer).
Includes +url_for+ into the host class.
Includes URI::REGEXP::PATTERN

It looks like it expanded the first entity, but didn't reparse it for more entities.
It mainly supports the methods on Numeric.
It makes little sense to be invoking bundle_identifier off of the installer instance.

It provides access to parent nodes and an object-oriented way to traverse an AST with the power of `Enumerable`.
It provides an interface for protecting attributes from end-user assignment.
It provides methods for creating matrices, operating on them arithmetically and algebraically, and determining their mathematical properties (trace, rank, inverse, determinant).
It provides several wrapper methods for the OutputMethod object used by the Notifier.
It provides two options that controls the top-level behavior of new instances:
It provides users the ability to execute commands with filters and pipes, like +sh+/+csh+ by using native facilities of Ruby.
It purposely does not inherit from Response because it doesn't need it.
It puts the state in the `:machine_state_id` key in the environment.
It raises a NameError when the name is not in CamelCase or is not initialized.
It reads legacy cookies signed with the old dummy key generator and encrypts and re-saves them using the new key generator to provide a smooth upgrade path.
It reads legacy cookies signed with the old dummy key generator and signs and re-saves them using the new key generator to provide a smooth upgrade path.
It relies on the fact that partials should follow the naming convention of being prefixed with an underscore -- as to separate them from regular templates that could be rendered on their own.
It remains for API compatibility
It requires the ORDER BY columns in the select list for distinct queries, and requires that the ORDER BY include the distinct column.
It requires you to give a physical path on initialization.

It shows how all migrations have two methods +up+ and +down+ that describes the transformations required to implement or remove the migration.
It simply does a direct SQL update for the record with the given ID, altering the given hash of counters by the amount given by the corresponding value:
It specifies which conversion block to call whenever a class is specified.
It still works but you must not use it.
It supports the following secure random number generators:
It takes an instance of a class, a method on that class and an instance variable.
It takes an object, a deprecation message and optionally a deprecator.
It takes either a column name, or the name of a belongs_to association.
It takes one argument, which is expected content length in bytes.

It takes the names of an old (deprecated) constant and of a new constant (both in string form) and optionally a deprecator.
It tests more completely than either unit or functional tests do, exercising the entire stack, from the dispatcher to the database.
It then checks each xpath against the source file.
It then looks at what constants are available and creates a consistent view on all rubys.
It then needs to create a server that attaches to each of these networks.

It waits for the completion of the commands.
It warns on each call to the dummy method telling the user of +repl+ (unless +repl+ is :none) and the year/month that it is planned to go away.
It was designed to address concerns users of that library had and it had three primary goals:
It was set in setup_build_environment, so we have to restore it here.
It will add the comment `# frozen_string_literal: true` to the top of files to enable frozen string literals.
It will affect the priority of loading views, helpers, assets, and all the other files related to engine or application.
It will also invoke the db:schema:dump task, which will update your db/schema.rb file to match the structure of your database.
It will also set the Content-Type, Content-Disposition, Content-Transfer-Encoding and encode the contents of the attachment in Base64.
It will auto resolve formula's spec when requested spec is nil
It will be aware when to stop rendering the layout because it needs to search something in the template and vice-versa.
It will be called as is, there will be no database agnostic conversions performed.
It will be deprecated in future versions of Rails.
It will be inserted into HTML with no additional escaping performed.
It will be installed automatically if there is a binary package for your platform and you haven't passed or previously used any options on this formula.
It will be merged with ActionController::Renderer.defaults
It will be nil if the system uses 4.3BSD style old recvmsg system call.
It will be sent once with the results from the test itself.
It will be treated as String."
It will be treated as String." To take full advantage of composite types, we suggest you register your own +OID::Type+.
It will be used in the output of the help.
It will convert code to use safe navigation if the target Ruby version is set to 2.3+
It will create IPV4 and IPV6 sockets on all interfaces.
It will escape any characters that would change the meaning of a regular expression in the encoding of +str+.
It will include all of the helpers from engine's directory.
It will include tests that tell you whether your object is fully compliant, or if not, which aspects of the API are not implemented.
It will not be installed."
It will not buffer your YAML, but send it straight to an IO.
It will override the type of existing attributes if needed.
It will probably disappear.
It will raise PStore::Error if called at any other time.
It will raise exceptions if anything fails.
It will register a separate offense for each misaligned *when*.
It will still allow passing just a message, or the construction of an error with more than one argument.
It will then use the comment from that method in the HTML output.
It will try to guess using the fields in a row of output though, when using CSV::generate_line() or Array#to_csv().
It will use the given +user_content_type+, or multipart if the mail message has any attachments.
It will wait up to the given duration or raise an exception if something goes wrong.
It works basically as a command recorder, saving each command to be applied after initialization over the default middleware stack, so you can add, swap, or remove any middleware in Rails.
It works for both inline:
It works line-by-line.
It yields Pathname object for each child.
It yields each object to the block given for #seplist.
It's OK if the user does not have the psych gem installed.
It's a string for backwards (RubyGems 1.3.5 and earlier) compatibility.
It's a way to redirect incoming requests to controllers and actions.
It's a wildcard match that we use for `respond_to` negotiation internals.
It's also a good idea to add indexes to each of those columns to speed up the joins process.
It's also important to note that while all of CSV's core parser is now Encoding agnostic, some features are not.
It's also important to treat the value objects as immutable.
It's also possible to construct multi-dimensional parameter hashes by specifying keys using brackets, such as:
It's also possible to delegate a method to the class by using +:class+:
It's also possible to pass a String instead of an options hash, which generates an anchor element that uses the value of the String as the href for the link.
It's also possible to specify the instance to be used:
It's automatically configured.
It's because HTTP_PROXY may be set by Proxy: header.
It's common to have resources that are logically children of other resources:
It's definitely a bug.
It's especially important that they set the platform attribute appropriately.
It's even possible to call these dynamic finder methods on relations and named scopes.
It's extremely important to run the syntax check in a clean environment - otherwise it will be extremely slow.
It's implemented as a cop in that it inherits from the Cop base class and calls add_offense.
It's important to note that this does *not* cause SimpleDelegator's methods to change.
It's important to note that this will essentially merge any of the keys in +pairs+ with the existing +section+.
It's impossible for a method call without parentheses to have a trailing comma.
It's initially stuck on the outer share lock, but as soon as that's released, it can run -- regardless of whether those threads hold share locks.
It's intended that +method+ returns an integer and if that integer is above zero, then the checkbox is checked.
It's just an alternative to if/elsif/elsif...
It's just too hard for me to support native conversions in all of Ruby's Encodings.
It's like a simple key/value store baked into your record when you don't care about being able to query that store outside the context of a single record.
It's much better to swap that:
It's much like the standard library PrettyPrint, that shows the value of each expression as it runs.
It's not possible to derive all render calls like that, though.
It's not possible to halt the validate callback chain.
It's optional and there can be more than one.
It's possible to set the fixture's model class directly in the YAML file.
It's possible to stack callbacks by passing them as an array.
It's pretty safe to assume that these calls are not missed by anyone reading code.
It's probably easier to just use the constructor though, since calling this method requires the setup of an ERB _compiler_ object.
It's purely an online queue, though.
It's really easy to do this, but we'll need the help of open-uri:
It's recommended to first ::escape the provided +uri_str+ if there are any invalid URI characters.
It's said that all X-Forwarded-* headers will contain more than one (comma-separated) value if the original request already contained one of these headers.
It's simply information for the user.
It's slightly strange.
It's still possible to use both the stand-alone FormHelper methods and methods from FormTagHelper.
It's strange if interpolation syntax appears inside a static string, but we can't be sure if it's a mistake or not.
It's strongly recommended that you check this file into your version control system.
It's strongly recommended that you do this if you do not want any other processes to be able to read from or write to the Tempfile, and you do not need to know the Tempfile's filename either.
It's technically possible for a fat Mach-O to have over 30 architectures, but this is extremely unlikely and in practice distinguishes the two formats.
It's the extra spaces between the keys and values in a multiline hash, since those are handled by the Style/AlignHash cop.
It's the same as Thor default except that the Command at the end of the class is removed.
It's the same as Thor default except that the Generator at the end of the class is removed.
It's up to subclasses to implement the stale_state method if relevant.
It's used as the default entry point for generate, destroy and update commands.
It's usually too much work to keep it all synchronized -- something databases already excel at.
It's well-suited for dev/test since it doesn't need an external infrastructure, but it's a poor fit for production since it drops pending jobs on restart.
It's yyparse() of yacc, and Racc::Parser#next_token is yylex().

Let's first just optimize it for retrieving the author:
Let's get some more useful booleans that we access a lot so we're not constantly calling an `include` check

Loop prevention for validation of associations
Loop through the requirements AST
Looping through a collection of records from the database (using the +all+ method, for example) is very inefficient since it will try to instantiate all the objects at once.
Loops can be said to have an exit condition, so they add one.

MessageEncryptor is a simple way to encrypt values which get stored somewhere you don't trust.
Messages are written to files named 'inbox/1', 'inbox/2', ....
Messages from Ruby applications are not considered as critical as messages from other system daemons using syslog(3), so most messages are reduced by one level.
Messages have two sorts of identifiers: message sequence numbers and UIDs.
Metadata items have the following restrictions:
Method arguments and return values are dumped and loaded in marshalled format.
Method call with dot on a string literal.
Method calls are delegated to the Mail::Message that's ready to deliver.
Method calls made over dRuby behave largely the same as normal Ruby method calls made within a process.
Method calls on this object are relayed to the remote object that this object is a stub for.
Method calls to +ali+ will be delegated to +accessor.method+.
Method calls with blocks are supported, as are raising exceptions.
Method contributed by Henrik Martensson
Method for creating new ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone instance in time zone of +self+ from given values.

Method for creating new ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone instance in time zone of +self+ from parsed string.
Method parameter lists are extracted and displayed with the method description.
Method present for compatibility, but is a noop
Method references and callback objects are the recommended approaches, inline methods using a proc are sometimes appropriate (such as for creating mix-ins), and inline eval methods are deprecated.
Method used internally to DRY out the other renderers.
Methods already defined are skipped.
Methods are not duplicable:
Methods are provided for phone numbers, currency, percentage, precision, positional notation, file size and pretty printing.
Methods called upon this DRbObject instance are forwarded to its remote object.
Methods can be delegated to instance variables, class variables, or constants by providing them as a symbols:
Methods defined on the FormBuilder are used to generate fields bound to this model.
Methods for #count, #sum, #average, minimum, and #maximum have been added as shortcuts.
Methods used by multiple fixtures should be defined in a module that is included in ActiveRecord::FixtureSet.context_class.
Methods which would normally return a String object now return a Chars object so methods can be chained.
Methods will be added for retrieval and query for a single associated object, for which this object holds an id:
Microsoft Windows is the most notable case: unlinking a non-closed file will result in an error, which this method will silently ignore.
Mid level is access to the raw YAML AST, and at the highest level is the ability to unmarshal YAML to Ruby objects.
Middleware class can be inserted as a Rack handler to be local cache for the duration of request.
Middleware like session, flash, cookies can be added back manually.
MiddlewareStackProxy is a proxy for the Rails middleware stack that allows you to configure middlewares in your application.
Middlewares can also be completely swapped out and replaced with others:
Middlewares that need to manipulate the body won't work with streaming.
Might want a shorter timeout depending on whether the request is a PATCH, PUT, or POST, and if the client is a browser or web service.
Migrate LinkedKegs/PinnedKegs if update didn't already do so
MigrationProxy is used to defer loading of the actual migration classes until they are needed
Migrations are currently supported in MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQL Server, and Oracle (all supported databases except DB2).

Most of the time, root only has one group
Most of this class is tested elsewhere.
Most recently modified file first.
Most session state is maintained on the server.

Most template dependencies can be derived from calls to render in the template itself.
Most tests set up a scenario then call a method you will provide to perform the assertion on the output.
Most text helpers by default sanitize the given content, but do not escape it.
Most useful for unit and functional testing.
Most user code will not use this class directly.
Most work with mailboxes, which may be arranged in an hierarchical namespace, and each of which contains zero or more messages.
Mostly taken from Thor/Rails (thanks).
Mostly we prefer a patch but if you need the `prefix` of this formula in the patch you have to resort to `inreplace`, because in the patch you don't have access to any var defined by the formula.

NOTE: Change following BigDecimal.limit() if needed.
NOTE: Currently no defaults check settings
NOTE: Discarded selects will default to 1.
NOTE: Do not edit collections yielded by this method
NOTE: Due to backwards compatibility concerns, the collection can't be one of hashes.
NOTE: Each nesting level will merge inherited defaults in addition to their own.
NOTE: Enabling automatic discovery on multiuser systems can lead to execution of arbitrary code when used from directories outside your control.
NOTE: For efficiency, this method uses StringIO and does not capture IO for subprocesses.
NOTE: Given Foo::Bar, Bar is considered a class even though it may be a method
NOTE: If you are going to iterate through each record, you should call each_record on the yielded BatchEnumerator:
NOTE: It's not possible to set the order.
NOTE: Only the option tags are returned, you have to wrap this call in a regular HTML select tag.
NOTE: Optimistic defaults are set in the provisioner.
NOTE: RFC 4648 does say nothing about unpadded input, but says that "the excess pad characters MAY also be ignored", so it is inferred that unpadded input is also acceptable.
NOTE: The default validations with the exception of +uniqueness+ will work.
NOTE: The formatting and content of this middleware's output is intended for human consumption, and should be expected to change between releases.
NOTE: The returned records may not be in the same order as the ids you provide since database rows are unordered.
NOTE: This check is performed only if +password_confirmation+ is not +nil+.
NOTE: This is _not_ a valid config validation method, since it returns an _array_ of strings rather than a Hash.
NOTE: This is currently commented out because it was causing major bugs (GH-5199).
NOTE: This method calls #remove_entry_secure if :secure option is set.
NOTE: This method is approximately 10x slower than #capture_io so only use it when you need to test the output of a subprocess.
NOTE: This method is deprecated.
NOTE: This only has an effect if Vagrant needs a Docker host.
NOTE: This test will not work with Syck
NOTE: This validation will not fail if the association hasn't been assigned.
NOTE: This validation will not fail while using it with an association if the latter was assigned but not valid.
NOTE: When pat is a Regexp the matching will be checked in process, otherwise egrep(1) will be invoked to check it.
NOTE: With Ruby 2.4+ the default for +to_time+ changed from converting to the local system time, to preserving the offset of the receiver.
NOTE: cygwin should be regarded as Unix.
NOTE: do not confuse this with +bindir+, which is just 'bin', not a full path.
NOTE: old_pin_record.realpath.sub(oldname, newname) is unacceptable here, because it resolves every symlink for old_pin_record and then substitutes oldname with newname.
NOTE: order is important here, since we want to extract nested containers before we handle any other artifacts
NOTE: queue_classic supports job scheduling since version 3.1.
NOTE: rack-test v0.5 doesn't build a default uri correctly Make sure requested path is always a full uri
NOTE: record might be sent more than once per test.
NOTE: removes uninstalled gems from +list+.
NOTE: the JoinDependency constructed here needs to know about any joins already present in `self`, so pass them in
NOTE: this is much slower than the regular inspect but much more usable for complex objects.
NOTE: this test seems to fail (changeset 1958) only on certain platforms, like OSX, and FreeBSD 5.4.
NOTE: this uses #capture_io, not #capture_subprocess_io.
NOTE: unexpected but GNU Readline's spec
NOTE: use #http_header to create HTTP header blocks, this alias is only provided for backwards compatibility.

Nested NoMethodError is a different name from the delegation
Nested NoMethodError is the same name as the delegation
Nested attribute writers are normal setter methods named after an association.
Nested attributes allow you to save attributes on associated records through the parent.
Nested attributes for an associated collection can also be passed in the form of a hash of hashes instead of an array of hashes:
Nested classes are given table names prefixed by the singular form of the parent's table name.
Nested classes are prefixed with singular parent table name.
Nested elements yield an +AtomBuilder+ instance.
Nested hash conditions with different keys
Nested hash conditions with same keys
Nested resources and/or namespaces are also supported, as illustrated in the example:
Nested transactions don't commit until all parent transactions commit, particularly, the fixtures transaction which is begun in setup and rolled back in teardown.

Normally this is +nil+.
Normally we don't want whitespace errors, but squashing them can break patches so an option is provided to skip this step.
Normally we've already committed by now, but it's possible (e.g., if the controller action tries to read back its own response) to get here before that.

Not a big deal, the temp file may not actually exist
Not a one-liner, so this is an offense.
Not aligned according to `indent` or `outdent` style:
Not all cases can reliably checked, due to Ruby's dynamic types, so we consider only cases when the first argument is an array literal or the second is a string literal.
Not all migrations change the schema.
Not all of these are defined in Ruby 1.8.7, hence the need for this convoluted setup.
Not all of these are defined in Ruby 1.8.7.

Not surprisingly, these delimiters look like HTML markup.
Not this cop's job to fix end.
Not used in core, used in taps.

Notations in the external DTD subset are not listed.
Note about replacing already defined headers:
Note again that the indexes start at 1.
Note also that because of backwards compatibility (loading new gems in an old RubyGems installation), we can't add explicit marshaling to this class until we want to make a big break.
Note also that destroying a record preserves its ID in the model instance, so deleted models are still comparable.
Note an object is not required to implement all APIs in order to work with Action Pack.
Note downloads for any installed formulae will still not be :    deleted.
Note in particular that by default the FileStore and PStore session data files have the same name.
Note that "adapter" and "protocol" are optional and will default to 1 and "tcp" respectively.
Note that "with-python", "without-python", "with-python3", and "without-python3" formula options are handled correctly even if not associated with any corresponding depends_on statement.
Note that #includes works with association names while #references needs the actual table name.
Note that +:controller+, +:action+ and +:id+ are interpreted as url query parameters and thus available through +params+ in an action.
Note that +cmd+ is a server command (such as "RETR myfile").

Note that binding must enclose the io you wish to output on.
Note that building your own string from user input may expose your application to injection attacks if not done properly.
Note that by default, the :method: directive will be ignored if there is a standard rdocable item following it.

Note that find_files will return all files even if they are from different versions of the same gem.
Note that if #start is called in ESMTP mode, and the connection fails due to a ProtocolError, the SMTP object will automatically switch to plain SMTP mode and retry (but not vice versa).
Note that if +line+ contains multiple rows, anything beyond the first row is ignored.
Note that if some blank-like object were initially passed into the query method, then this method will not raise an error.
Note that if the middleware sequence ends early, then the new middleware won't be run.
Note that if the target has not been loaded, it is not considered stale.
Note that if the user has JavaScript disabled, the request will fall back to using GET.
Note that if you are really concerned about your application security, you might consider using +config.force_ssl+ in your config file instead.
Note that if you are working on a guide generation will by default process only that one, so ONLY is rarely used nowadays.
Note that if you do not specify the +:inverse_of+ option, then Active Record will try to automatically guess the inverse association based on heuristics.
Note that if you return a path without a leading slash then the url is prefixed with the current SCRIPT_NAME environment variable.
Note that if you use +permit+ in a key that points to a hash, it won't allow all the hash.
Note that in this case, the returned response object will *not* contain a (meaningful) body.
Note that it also means that associations marked for destruction won't be destroyed directly.
Note that it always returns +true+ with boolean attributes.
Note that it handles both ASCII and Unicode whitespace.
Note that it is not widely implemented and should be set to zero.
Note that it may accept connections too much.
Note that it still rejects incorrectly-padded input.
Note that keys are treated differently than HashWithIndifferentAccess, meaning that string and symbol keys will not match.
Note that magic comments must be at the first line(except sh-bang).
Note that marking a constant for unloading need only be done once.
Note that meanwhile the class Pet is not reloaded, simulating a class that is present in a plugin.
Note that new records are different from any other record by definition, unless the other record is the receiver itself.
Note that now there can be more than one router in your application, and it's better to avoid passing requests through many routers.
Note that one reason that read_nonblock writes to the underlying IO is when the peer requests a new TLS/SSL handshake.
Note that one reason that write_nonblock reads from the underlying IO is when the peer requests a new TLS/SSL handshake.
Note that partials are not supported to be rendered with streaming, so in such cases, we just wrap them in an array.
Note that passing custom disallowed types will override the default types, which are Symbol and YAML.
Note that setting the UUID primary key default value to +nil+ will require you to assure that you always provide a UUID value before saving a record (as primary keys cannot be +nil+).
Note that some of its interface is available directly.
Note that some of the migrations may be skipped if a migration with the same name already exists in application.
Note that the +:limit+ option is only applicable to one-to-many associations.
Note that the +do end+ syntax for the redirect block wouldn't work, as Ruby would pass the block to +get+ instead of +redirect+.
Note that the MD5 is taken of the entire template file, not just what's within the cache do/end call.
Note that the Ruby URI library allows HTTP URLs containing usernames and passwords.
Note that the _exact_ semantics of this are up to the communication provider itself.
Note that the active mode is default in Ruby 1.8 or prior.
Note that the association_scope is merged into the target_scope only when the scope method is called.
Note that the block is not run immediately.
Note that the block isn't run immediately.
Note that the built-in Ruby digest classes duck type this properly: Digest::MD5, Digest::SHA1, etc.
Note that the contract between publisher and subscriber (observable and observer) is not declared or enforced.
Note that the machines in this array may no longer be present in the Vagrantfile of this environment.
Note that the model is _not_ yet removed from the database:
Note that the model will _not_ be destroyed until the parent is saved.
Note that the proxy server is not a *real* proxy server.
Note that the request method is not verified.
Note that the request parameter might not be supplied, e.g. when the assets are precompiled via a Rake task.
Note that the result cache is completely busted, so any gets on the new registry will result in a cache miss.
Note that the result is always UTC (GMT).
Note that the result is not copied.
Note that the results never contain the entries +.+ and +..+ in the directory because they are not children.
Note that the return value of validation methods is not relevant.
Note that the rules which can derive empty and non-empty sequences are modified to derive only non-empty sequences.
Note that the selection of functions is similar, but not identical, to that in module math.
Note that the session's data is _not_ automatically deleted upon the session expiring.
Note that the status code must be a 3xx HTTP code, or redirection will not occur.
Note that the trailing space is intentional
Note that the usec for the time passed will be set to 0 to prevent rounding errors with external services, like MySQL (which will round instead of floor, leading to off-by-one-second errors).
Note that the validator is initialized only once for the whole application life cycle, and not on each validation run.
Note that these are implemented as callbacks, and Rails executes callbacks in order.
Note that these expressions are meant to pick up text for which cross-references have been suppressed, since the suppression characters are removed by the code that is triggered.
Note that these methods do not strictly require +Post+ to be a subclass of ActiveRecord::Base.
Note that these tests must be executed in order for the third one to actually test anything.
Note that this conversion makes some assumptions about the duration of some periods, e.g. months are always 30 days and years are 365.25 days:
Note that this doesn't attempt to distinguish between libstdc++ versions, for instance between Apple libstdc++ and GNU libstdc++
Note that this doesn't guarantee to write all data in string.
Note that this is a "shallow" copy as it copies the object's attributes only, not its associations.
Note that this is a naive implementation because we could have strings and symbols which represent the same association, but that aren't matched by this.
Note that this is currently not recommended since it breaks caching.
Note that this is not just a usage suggestion.
Note that this is not the same as the document element.
Note that this is only useful if the original XML is not already formatted.
Note that this is simply 'syntactic sugar' for defining an actual class method:
Note that this isn't strictly enforced at the moment, and this class isn't directly used.
Note that this logic is a bit redundant if we have "provider" set but I think its probably cleaner to put this logic in one place.
Note that this may _not_ directly match over to actually installed gems.
Note that this method actually runs the queries, since the results of some are needed by the next ones when eager loading is going on.
Note that this method does not actually affect the generated Makefile.
Note that this method is identical to readpartial except the non-blocking flag is set.
Note that this method must be called before header rows are read to have any effect.
Note that this method removes records from the database ignoring the +:dependent+ option.
Note that this operation instantly fires update SQL without waiting for the save or update call on the parent object, unless the parent object is a new record.
Note that this returns a string and not a Class (To convert to an actual class follow +classify+ with #constantize).
Note that this returns a string and not a class.
Note that this schema.rb definition is the authoritative source for your database schema.
Note that this setting will not skip rows that contain column separators, even if the rows contain no actual data.
Note that this should only be used for testing purposes.
Note that this will clear anything that is being used to validate the model for both the +validates_with+ and +validate+ methods.
Note that this will probably never be used
Note that this will unsubscribe all subscriptions with the given name:
Note that unlike "kernel_v1", none of these configuration classes are upgradable.
Note that unlike :quit, signals are sent from the current user (not upgraded to the superuser).
Note that unlike reorder, we're only unscoping the named conditions -- not the entire where statement.
Note that using conditions like this can have unintended consequences.
Note that we are including a 30-second boundary around the interval we want to test.
Note that we don't actually need to serialize the jobs since we're performing them in-process, but we do so anyway for parity with other adapters and deployment environments.
Note that when an array is used, the implicit mapping from the values to database integers is derived from the order the values appear in the array.
Note that when options are passed in, you must call +objectify_options+ in order for the model object to get correctly passed to the method.
Note that when working with CoreOS, we explicitly do not add the entry to /etc/hosts because this file does not exist on CoreOS.
Note that you can't use HAVING without also specifying a GROUP clause.
Note that, unlike calling #authenticate() with an +auth_type+ of "LOGIN", #login() does *not* use the login authenticator.
Note the filename is not stored.
Note the strange method name is to attempt to avoid any name clashes with potential configuration keys.
Note the subtle difference between the two: +assert_routing+ tests that a URL fits options while +assert_recognizes+ tests that a URL breaks into parameters properly.
Note this method does not imply the records are actually removed from the database, that depends precisely on +delete_records+.
Note, all the attributes for all the cases are kept in the same table.
Note, however, that GetoptLong is a pure Ruby implementation.
Note, however, that this is not a command line parser.
Note, however, the extra bit at the top of that action:
Note, that different ways to install the CLTs lead to different version numbers.
Note, that this is not your usual scan() method.
Note, with using explicit self you can only send messages with public or protected scope, you cannot send private messages this way.
Note: +:id+ is always present.
Note: Acronyms that are passed to +pluralize+ will no longer be recognized, since the acronym will not occur as a delimited unit in the pluralized result.
Note: Any of the arguments can be arrays as well.
Note: Fixtures are unordered.
Note: How end-of-line comments are associated with code changed in parser-2.2.0.4.
Note: If the day is not included as an option but the month is, the day will be set to the 1st to ensure that all month choices are valid.
Note: If there are any middleware after `SSHExec`, they will **not** run, since exec replaces the currently running process.
Note: Instantiation, callback execution, and deletion of each record can be time consuming when you're removing many records at once.
Note: It is possible for this value to match multiple options as you might have the same option in multiple groups.
Note: Joining, eager loading and preloading of these associations is not fully possible.
Note: MySQL doesn't yet support index order (it accepts the syntax but ignores it).
Note: No Lint/UselessAssignment offense.
Note: Partial indexes are only supported for PostgreSQL and SQLite 3.8.0+.
Note: Regexp expiration is only supported on caches that can iterate over all keys (unlike memcached).
Note: Rinda::Ring API is unstable.
Note: SQLite doesn't support index length.
Note: SSEs are not currently supported by IE.
Note: The initialize for WinRMAuthorizationError may require a status_code as the second argument in a future WinRM release.
Note: The new instance will share a link to the same attributes as the original class.
Note: The old instance's sti column value will be changed too, as both objects share the same set of attributes.
Note: The path passed to `--require` is directly passed to `Kernel.require`.
Note: The precision is the total number of significant digits, and the scale is the number of digits that can be stored following the decimal point.
Note: This also works for the methods in FormOptionHelper and DateHelper that are designed to work with an object as base, like FormOptionHelper#collection_select and DateHelper#datetime_select.
Note: This assertion is simply a shortcut for:
Note: This is an optimization of `Enumerable#without` that uses `Array#-` instead of `Array#reject` for performance reasons.
Note: This is purely a browser performance optimization and is not meant for server load balancing.
Note: This method NEVER returns.
Note: To remain compatible with Ruby 1.8, we have to use a `find` here instead of an `each`.
Note: Updating a large number of records will run an UPDATE query for each record, which may cause a performance issue.
Note: You can also use Rails' i18n functionality for this.
Note: `raise_error` refers to us re-raising the error in this method.
Note: always returns false if '0'.
Note: depending on your database connector, the result returned by this method may be manually memory managed.
Note: for masgn, #asgn_rhs will be an array node
Note: klass will always be valid because when there's a NameError from calling +klass+, +reflection+ will already be set to false.
Note: no need to specialize private_methods, since they are not forwarded
Note: only check homepages that are repo pages, not *.github.com hosts
Note: only supported by MySQL.
Note: only supported by PostgreSQL and MySQL
Note: parser.rb is LGPL, but your parser is not.
Note: please adjust paths accordingly use for example 'locate yaml.rb' and 'gem environment' to identify directories, that are specific for your local installation
Note: the +options+ hash passed to +object.to_json+ is only passed to +object.as_json+, not any of this method's recursive +#as_json+ calls.
Note: there isn't a std_autotools variant because autotools is a lot less consistent and the standard parameters are more memorable.
Note: this does not capture all cases, for example it would be crazy to try to properly support stale-checking for nested associations.
Note: this is almost the same as valparse, except that it does not accept atomic values.
Note: this is legacy syntax, see +tag+ method description for details.
Note: this must be called at least once per process to take any effect.
Note: we assume that the size of intptr_t and uintptr_t equals to the size of real pointer.
Note: when using +controller+, the route is simply named after the method you call on the block parameter rather than map.
Note: you should use chef-apply instead.
Notes: - Solaris/OpenSolaris/Illumos uses SunSSH which doesn't support the IdentitiesOnly option.
Nothing is necessary to do before VM boot.
Nothing is said about existing indentation that mixes spaces and tabs, so there is nothing to test.
Nothing more, nothing less.
Nothing to do if we have no bad folders
Nothing we can do if we are in a transaction because all commands will raise InFailedSQLTransaction
Nothing will be appended to the errors object.
Notice that "rails:commands:webrat" could be loaded as well, what Rails looks for is the first and last parts of the namespace.
Notice that "rails:generators:test_unit" could be loaded as well, what Rails looks for is the first and last parts of the namespace.
Notice that "rails:generators:webrat" could be loaded as well, what Rails looks for is the first and last parts of the namespace.
Notice that :stream only works with templates.
Notice that all markdown-style link references will be appended to the excerpt.
Notice that blank lines right after the label are ignored in labeled lists:
Notice that events get sent even if an error occurs in the passed-in block.
Notice that for Integer and Float columns empty strings are converted to +nil+.
Notice that no +:id+ parameter was provided to the first +url_for+ call and the helper used the one from the route's path.
Notice that the first argument is the method to be dispatched which is *not* necessarily the same as the action name.
Notice that we use a bang in this instrumentation because you don't want to consume this in production.
Notice that when you add a path using +add+, the path object created already contains the path with the same path value given to +add+.
Notice the 97.18 as a float is greater than 97.18 as a BigDecimal due to floating point precision
Notice the need in this example to provide a special binding when the template is run, so that the instance variables in the Product object can be resolved.
Notice this method raises an error if the template to be refreshed does not have a virtual path set (true just for inline templates).
Notice this method takes into consideration the default root path.
Notifications ships with a queue implementation that consumes and publishes events to all log subscribers.
Notifications will be sent only if the changed +state+ is +true+.
Notifier.welcome(User.first).deliver_later Notifier.welcome(User.first).deliver_later(wait: 1.hour) Notifier.welcome(User.first).deliver_later(wait_until: 10.hours.from_now)
Notifier.welcome(User.first).deliver_now
NotifierMailer.welcome(User.first).deliver_later # enqueue the email sending to Active Job
Notifies observers of a change in state.
Notify fork that files have been touched.
Notify observers of a change in state *if* this object's changed state is +true+.
Notify the provider that the ID changed in case it needs to do any accounting from it.
Now RubyGems defers to -I and the RUBYLIB environment variable to skip activation of a gem.
Now all you have to do is change that timestamp when the helper method changes.
Now autoload handles this.
Now check the plugin gem names
Now contains DecimalInteger, OctalInteger and DecimalNumeric.
Now it _is_ removed from the database:
Now it's possible to access attributes from the database through the value objects instead.
Now let's verify the signature.
Now reload, and verify that it gets the DB version, and not the querycache version
Now routes such as +/posts/1+ will no longer be valid, but +/posts/1.1+ will be.
Now swap around the mapping so that it is a mapping of count to the actual list of host names
Now that we're sure some kind of yaml library is loaded, pull in our hack to deal with Syck's DefaultKey ugliness.
Now that we've got Syck setup in all the right places, store a reference to the DefaultKey class inside Gem.
Now that we've got something that is always here, define #to_s so when code tries to use this, it at least just shows up like it should.
Now the Date class can be loaded in addition to the classes listed above.
Now update the timestamp.
Now use the Rails insertion
Now verify it's identical to a JSON round trip.
Now verify when we actually get the command key that a proper error is raised.
Now verify when we actually get the configuration key that a proper error is raised.
Now verify when we actually get the guest key that a proper error is raised.
Now verify when we actually get the host key that a proper error is raised.
Now we are going to change the template, but it won't change the returned template since the timestamp is the same.
Now we are going to change the template, but it won't change the returned template since we will hit the cache.
Now we figure out, of the possible found specs, which one we should activate.
Now we have a URL, we have to download this URL.
Now we have to sort out what kind of entity reference this is
Now we will change back the locale and it will still pick the old template.
Now when a new request for the index action is processed, the layout will vary depending on whether the person accessing is logged in or not.
Now yield to the code that is to define new constants.
Now you can have different transliterations for each locale:
Now you can install packages signed by your private key without any hassle.
Now you can mount your engine in application's routes just like that:
Now, +Engine+ will get only requests that were not handled by +Application+.
Now, I have the mutex
Now, every time something is concatenated to the buffer, it is not appended to an array, but streamed straight to the client.
Now, let's try a file with an extension, really a dot (.)
Now, validate that the source we got back from the template handler is valid in the default_internal.
Now, we create the actual local data directory.
Now, you can take advantage of the Object#xmp convenience method.
Null bytes after percent signs are removed:
Number of decimals, behind the separator (the number 1 with a precision of 2 gives: 1.00)
Number of digits to be obtained.
Number of seconds to wait for one block to be read (via one read(2) call).
Number of seconds to wait for the connection to open.
Number of times this job has been executed (which increments on every retry, like after an exception).
Number.create(i: 0) rescue ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid ...which we ignore.
Number.transaction do Number.create(i: 0) begin This will raise a unique constraint error...
Numbers are not duplicable:
Numeric values are treated as seconds.
Numeric::  it will expire in that many seconds.
O - Enables argument refurbishing.
OK let's get our test on
OK, the BIG doctype test, numba wun
OLEProperty helper class of Property with arguments.
ON DELETE RESTRICT is the default on MySQL

OS X 10.8.2 Supplemental Update
OSXFuse MacFuse compatibility layer
O_NOFOLLOW is not standard.
Oakley curves and X25519 are not suitable for signing and causes FIPS-selftest failure on some environment, so skip for now.
Object identifier types
Object includes this module.
Object wrapping a reference to a remote drb object.
Object#pretty_print_cycle is used when +obj+ is already printed, a.k.a the object reference chain has a cycle.
Object-Oriented Pathname Class
Object: This is a section
Object: section title
ObjectSpace.garbage_collect
Objects of AggregateReflection and AssociationReflection are returned by the Reflection::ClassMethods.
Objects of this class are created by RDoc::RD for an extension-less include.
Obsolete: use +subtype+ instead.
Obtain a row lock on this record.
Obtain an array of Mach-O blobs from raw file data.
Obtain an array of fat architectures from raw file data.
Obtain destination path.
Obtain the fat header from raw file data.

Obtains the path to where the object's partial is located.
Obtains the specified cache store class, given the name of the +store+.
Obtains the value for a given +scope_type+ and +model+.
Obviously this RubyGems trust infrastructure doesn't exist yet.
Obviously, discovery takes a little time.
Obviously, the last one is subjective.
Of course, RDoc::Options does not respond to +spell_dictionary+ by default so you will need to add it:
Of course, on a case-insensitive fs, both exist because the os reports so.
Of course, the most common way of specifying a layout is still just as a plain template name:
Of course, you can also query them directly if the scopes don't fit your needs:
Of course, you can choose to later call #unlink if you do not unlink it now.
Offense occurs in 2 files, limit is 1, so no Exclude.
Offenses are displayed at compact form - just the location of the problem and the associated message.
Offenses are signaled only on assignment to class variables to reduced the number of offenses that would be reported.
Often referred to as an _object_, hash table, record, struct, keyed list, or associative array.
Often this can be simplified by passing just the name of the model object to +fields_for+ -
Oh god escaping shell args.
Oh well, maybe they'll have better luck causing problems for CPAN users instead :).
Ok, now find a gem that has no conflicts, starting at the highest version.
Ok, this is a bit odd.
Old GDBM's ndbm.h, until 1.8.3, defines dbm_clearerr as a macro which expands to no tokens.
Old Ruby 1.8 CSV library tests.
Old format gems cannot be verified as signed.
Old-format packages cannot be written.
Older tabs won't have these values, so provide sensible defaults
Older version of OpenSSL may not be consistent.
Omitting will use the default, "execution expired"
Omitting will use the default, Timeout::Error +message+:: Error message to raise with Exception Class.
On 10.7 and 10.8 we need to add these directories ourselves.
On 10.8 and newer, these flags will also be present: s - apply fix for sed's Unicode support a - apply fix for apr-1-config path
On 10.9, the tools in /usr/bin proxy to the active developer directory.
On 10.9, there are shims for all tools in /usr/bin.
On Cygwin we want to get rid of any DOS file warnings because we really don't care since both work.
On Fedora 16+, systemd replaced init.d, so we have to use the proper NFS binary.
On JRuby and Rubinius, there's a risk that we hang in tokenize() if we don't set the all errors as fatal flag.
On JRuby, we need to close the writers after the process, for some reason.
On Java, we have to close after.
On POSIX systems it's possible to unlink a file before closing it.
On POSIX systems, it's possible to unlink a file right after creating it, and before closing it.
On Ruby 2.0+ keyword arguments can optionally be excluded from the total count.
On Windows, Ruby just uses normal '/' for path seps, so just replace normal Windows style seps with Unix ones.
On Windows, permissions don't matter as much, so don't worry about doing chmod.
On Windows, we default to the USERPROFILE directory if it is available.
On Windows, we don't want to accidentally call the actual VirtualBox
On Windows, we have to set a default chmod flag to avoid permission issues
On Windows, we need to be careful about drive letters
On Windows, we need to detect whether SSH is actually "plink" underneath the covers.
On Windows, we use the VBOX_INSTALL_PATH environmental variable to find VBoxManage.
On Windows: if filename contains an extension, we must match that exact filename
On Windows: otherwise try to match all possible executable file extensions (.EXE .COM .BAT etc.)
On all other platforms, including Cygwin, it will return 'make'.
On any platform we don't want a .rubocop.yml file in the temporary directory to affect the outcome of rspec.
On exit, x is the solution vector.
On failure, a blank line is returned on the standard output.
On initialization, the ActiveModel accepts the instance name that will receive the calls:
On machines without Unix-domain sockets, the default is to connect to localhost.
On my machine (OSX 10.8.3 on i5 1.7 GHz) this generates:
On non-linux platforms (where there is no native docker), force the host VM.
On shared hosts, Apache sometimes doesn't pass authentication headers to FCGI instances.
On some database systems, such as PostgreSQL, database errors inside a transaction cause the entire transaction to become unusable until it's restarted from the beginning.
On some platforms (e.g. Solaris), libc malloc does not return freed memory to OS because of efficiency, and linking with extra malloc library is needed to detect memory leaks.
On some platforms such as Windows, write_nonblock is not supported according to the kind of the IO object.
On subsequent requests, the If-None-Match header is set to the cached ETag.
On the client side, receive a reply from the server.
On the client side, send a request to the server.
On the other hand it could be that the target has side-effects, whereas conceptually, from the user point of view, the delegator should be doing one call.
On the other hand, we want to monitor the performance of our real database queries, not the performance of the access to the query cache.
On the server side, for an instance returned by #open_server, accept a client connection and return a new instance to handle the server's side of this client-server session.
On the server side, receive a request from the client.
On the server side, send a reply to the client.
Once Subclass assigns a value then the value assigned by Subclass would be returned.
Once a #composed_of relationship is specified for a model, records can be loaded from the database by specifying an instance of the value object in the conditions hash.
Once a mailer action and template are defined, you can deliver your message or defer its creation and delivery for later:
Once again, the return object is treated as an opaque value by the Vagrant configuration loader, so it can be anything you'd like.
Once booted, setup the folder contents
Once for the parent class, once for the child
Once it has uninstalled a gem, it is removed from that list.
Once our chunk of behavior starts pushing the scroll-to-understand-it boundary, we give in and move it to a separate file.
Once rendering the template is done, sets its content in the :layout key.
Once the client has successfully selected a mailbox, they enter _selected_ state, and that mailbox becomes the _current_ mailbox, on which mail-item related commands implicitly operate.
Once the upgrade is complete, the old dotfile is removed, and the environment becomes incompatible for Vagrant 1.0 environments.
Once the variable is captured by a block, we have no idea when, where and how many times the block would be invoked and it means we cannot track the usage of the variable.
Once you're inside the prompt, you can start debugging your program.
Once you've required Shellwords, you can use the #split alias String#shellsplit.
One FormData will be created for each entry.
One by one, each engine sets up its load paths, routes and runs its config/initializers/* files.
One can additionally pass a hash as an argument to unscope specific +:where+ values.
One can generate the same path as the above example by using the following code:
One can specify multiple memcached servers, and MemCacheStore will load balance between all available servers.
One day remove this probably.
One exception is the ActiveRecord::Rollback exception, which will trigger a ROLLBACK when raised, but not be re-raised by the transaction block.
One layer deep hash of connection values.
One minor exception comes when generating CSV into a String with an Encoding that is not ASCII compatible.
One of +:public+, +:protected+, +:private+ or +:nodoc+.
One of :Stop, :Running or :Shutdown
One query for columns (delete_me table) One query for primary key (delete_me table) One query to do the bulk change
One query for updating name, not triggering query for updating pirate_id
One query to nullify the old ship, one query to update the new ship
One reason is that editors, such as Emacs, expect this.
One reason you may wish to call this method explicitly is between queries that ask the database to randomize results.
One recommendation is to simply be explicit in a comment, like:
One should always unlink the file after using it, as is explained in the "Explicit close" good practice section in the Tempfile overview:
One should restart the entire transaction if an ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid occurred.
One way to change these is to specify `always_permitted_parameters` in your config.
One way to use this is to pass an array to layout and treat it as an enumerable.
One workaround is to begin a transaction on each class whose models you alter:

Optional arguments are passed to the constructor of the digest class.
Optional parameter +arg+ is a string pushed back to be the first non-option argument.
Optionally accepts a namespace, and all keys will be scoped within that namespace.
Optionally additional +prerelease+ gems may be included.
Optionally raises an error if the next token is not of the expected type.
Optionally raises an exception if the layout could not be found.
Optionally removes a +type+ column.
Optionally takes +name+ and +version+.
Optionally, if you give a specific component, then it will return the proper superclass for that component as well.
Options are passed to the underlying cache implementation.
Options are provided for phone numbers, currency, percentage, precision, positional notation, file size and pretty printing.
Options are required to occur before non-options.
Options are: :cache_dir:: Alternate repository path to store .gem files in.
Options can be passed in the last argument.
Options can occur anywhere in the command line parsed.
Options cannot be overridden in the instance methods for performance reasons, so be sure to set what you want here.
Options for the build dir synced folder if a host VM is in use.
Options may also be used by concerns defined in a block by accepting a block parameter.
Options must be taken because of https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/10856
Options passed in through +yaml_opts+ will be used when converting the store to YAML via Hash#to_yaml().
Options passed to `brew install` such as `--HEAD` also need to be provided to `brew test`.
Options supported are +:compress+, +:compress_threshold+, and +:expires_in+.
Options that `git-log`(1) :    recognizes can be passed before the formula list.
Options that we don't handle are yielded.
Options used by the Ruby interpreter will have been removed.
Opts can be used to set some options.
Or a collection to be used:
Or a string containing an i18n scope where to find this hash.
Or an alternative way:
Or an enumerator which is compatible to an +Enumerator+ if no block given.
Or convert it to Ruby:
Or equivalently, if +TenderloveMigration+ is defined as in the documentation for Migration:
Or even multiple scope parameters.
Or even to render a special view:
Or if the format is json:
Or if you simply want to make a GET request, you may pass in an URI object that has a HTTPS URL.
Or it can be omitted.
Or mixin Mutex_m into your module to your class inherit Mutex instance methods.
Or with a block where self points to the current record to be validated:
Or you may provide a custom delivery method object e.g. +MyOwnDeliveryMethodClass+.
Or, an implementation might choose to use one-time nonces or digests for POST, PUT, or PATCH requests and a time-stamp for GET requests.
Or, invoke irb with the above prompt mode by:
Or, progressively roll out the cache invalidation using a computed value:
Or, rewrite everything.
Or, using a callable object, you might implement something more specific to your application, which would be out of place in your routes file.
Oracle DATE columns are datetime columns and Oracle adapter returns Time value
Oracle UPDATE does not support ORDER BY
Oracle adapter cannot have specified index name larger than 30 characters Oracle adapter is shortening index name when just column list is given
Oracle adapter returns count() as Integer or Float
Oracle adapter returns floating point value 636.0 after SUM
Oracle adapter truncates alias to 30 characters
Oracle adapter uses prefetched primary key values from sequence and passes them to connection adapter insert method
Oracle barfs on this because the join includes unqualified and conflicting column names
Oracle does not allow double quotes in table and column names at all therefore quoting removes them
Oracle does not have a TIME datatype.
Oracle does not support boolean expressions in SELECT.
Oracle enhanced adapter allows to define Date attributes in model class (see topic.rb)
Oracle has some funky default handling, so it requires a bit of extra testing.
Oracle identifier length is limited to 30 bytes or less, `polymorphic` renamed `poly`
Oracle needs primary key value from sequence
Oracle saves empty string as NULL
Oracle saves empty string as NULL therefore :message changed to one space
Oracle sometimes sorts differently if WHERE condition is changed
Oracle supports precision up to 38 and it identifies decimals with scale 0 as integers
Oracle/SQLServer supports precision up to 38
Order by added as otherwise Oracle tests were failing because of different order of results
Order is the same as that returned by +columns+.
Order matters here since `HOMEBREW_CELLAR` and `HOMEBREW_REPOSITORY` are children of `HOMEBREW_PREFIX` by default.
Order the plugins by priority.
Order the providers by priority.
Ordered by desc offense count
Ordinal returns the suffix used to denote the position in an ordered sequence such as 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th.
Ordinalize turns a number into an ordinal string used to denote the position in an ordered sequence such as 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th.
Ordinarily you want to use the default fetcher from Gem::SpecFetcher::fetcher which uses the Gem.sources.

Psych is a YAML parser and emitter.
Psych is maintained by Aaron Patterson on github: https://github.com/tenderlove/psych
Psych provides a range of interfaces for parsing a YAML document ranging from low level to high level, depending on your parsing needs.
Psych provides a range of interfaces ranging from low to high level for producing YAML documents.
Psych provides access to an AST produced from parsing a YAML document.
Psych simply takes a Ruby data structure and converts it to a YAML document.
Psych uses Psych::Parser in combination with Psych::TreeBuilder to construct an AST of the parsed YAML document.
Psych.load_file("database.yml")
Psych::Handler defines all events that Psych::Parser can possibly send to event handlers.
Psych::Nodes contains all of the classes that make up the nodes of a YAML AST.
Psych::Nodes::Document nodes must have one and *only* one child.
Psych::Nodes::Scalar and Psych::Nodes::Alias are both terminal nodes and should not have any children.
Psych::Nodes::Sequence and Psych::Nodes::Mapping nodes may have many children, but Psych::Nodes::Mapping nodes should have an even number of children.
Psych::Stream#start will take a block and ensure that Psych::Stream#finish is called, so you can do this form:

Qu is a Ruby library for queuing and processing background jobs.
Qu was created to overcome some shortcomings in the existing queuing libraries.
Quarantining them into one file helps us know when we can get rid of them.
Que is a high-performance alternative to DelayedJob or QueueClassic that improves the reliability of your application by protecting your jobs with the same ACID guarantees as the rest of your data.
Que is a queue for Ruby and PostgreSQL that manages jobs using advisory locks.
Queries are collected asynchronously by the subscriber and returned.
Queries the database and returns the results in an Array-like object
Queries the primary key value.
Query if the following named route was already defined.
Query implementation notes: - format_type includes the column size constraint, e.g. varchar(50) - ::regclass is a function that gives the id for a table name
Query methods allow you to test whether an attribute value is present.
Query parameters on the URL are converted into POST parameters
QueryExtension Exception raised when there is an invalid encoding detected
Querying logic can instead be passed to the `count` call.
Queue in which the job will reside.
Queue: The adapter can set the priority for job queues, when setting a queue with Active Job this will be respected.
Queue: The timeout is set for all jobs on the queue.
Quit early, don't try to parse the JSON of gigabytes of box files...

Quotes the column name.
Quotes the table name.
RAILS_ENV needs to be set before config/application is required.
RDoc and ri data generation can be enabled or disabled through +generate_rdoc+ and +generate_ri+ respectively.
RDoc automatically cross-references words with underscores or camel-case.
RDoc comes with the HTML generator RDoc::Generator::Darkfish and an ri data generator RDoc::Generator::RI.
RDoc plugin authors can register additional directives to be handled by using RDoc::Markup::PreProcess::register.
RDoc ships with formatters for converting back to rdoc, ANSI text, HTML, a Table of Contents and other formats.
RDoc will always try to emit documentation even if given invalid TomDoc.
RDoc will then call #generate on the generator instance.
RDoc::CrossReference is used to generate those links based on the current context.
RDoc::Extend.new 'Enumerable', 'comment ...'
RDoc::Include and RDoc::Extend are both mixins.
RDoc::Include.new 'Enumerable', 'comment ...'
RDoc::Markup and other markup formats do no output formatting, this is handled by the RDoc::Markup::Formatter subclasses.
RDoc::Markup is intended to be the basis for a family of tools which share the common requirement that simple, plain-text should be rendered in a variety of different output formats and media.
RDoc::RD::BlockParser for tmp src
RECEIVER#METHOD_ID is a method to get next token.
RECENT:: the number of recent messages in the mailbox.

REMOTE_ADDR will be correct if the request is made directly against the Ruby process, on e.g. Heroku.
REVISIT: consider removing as too impl-bound
REXML does not write one if one was not specified, because it adds unnecessary bandwidth to applications such as XML-RPC.
RFC 1738 specifically states that the path for an FTP URI does not include the / which separates the URI path from the URI host.
RFC 2617 defines "auth" and "auth-int"
RFC6068, The mailto URL scheme
RNDGETENTCNT(0x80045200) mean "get entropy count".
ROUTES TODO: These assertions should really work in an integration context
RSS Parser raises error even if this is "should" not "must".
RSS does not allow for free-form tag names, so if an RSS feed contains a tag that we don't know about, an UnknownTagError is raised.
RSS has three different versions.
RSS, being an XML-based format, has namespace support.
RSpec mixes Matchers (which has a #method_missing) into IntegrationTest's superclass.
RTLD_NEXT is useful for implementing wrappers around library functions.
Racc grammar files resemble yacc files.
Racc is a LALR(1) parser generator.
Racc::Parser#do_parse is simple.
Racc::Parser#yyparse is little complicated, but useful.
Rack "close" maps to Response#abort, and *not* Response#close (which is used when the controller's finished writing)
Rack doesn't handle multipart/mixed for us.
Rack::Sendfile will usually intercept the response and uses the path directly, so there is no reason to open the file.
Rails discourages the use of functional tests in favor of integration tests (use ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest).
Rails dups objects in a few critical spots where they are not that arbitrary.
Rails finds namespaces similar to thor, it only adds one rule:
Rails own autoload, eager_load, etc.
Rails starts with the layout, and the template is rendered later, when its +yield+ is reached.
Rails uses the alias internally, and plugin authors are encouraged to do so.
Rails, Sinatra, etc.) process.
Rails, the web application framework, uses ERB to create views.

Round trip a job in memory only
Rounds a value to the next multiple of the given round.
Roundtrip to Rake to allow plugins to hook into database initialization.
Routes can also be constrained to an IP or a certain range of IP addresses:
Routes can be added to the table by calling Routes#add_route.
Routes can generate pretty URLs.
Routes method calls to the referenced remote object.
Routing Concerns allow you to declare common routes that can be reused inside others resources and routes.
Rows may be set to an Array of values (which will inherit the table's headers()) or a CSV::Row.
Rubinius' String#scrub, however, doesn't support ASCII-incompatible chars.
RuboCop can be run in contexts where unexpected other libraries are included, which may interfere with its normal behavior.
RuboCop must be in control of where its cached data is stored.
Rubocop does not allow reader methods to have names starting with `get_` To ensure compatibility, this check has been disabled on this method
Ruby 1.8 feature change: Array#reverse always returns self.
Ruby 1.8 feature change: assigning nil does not remove elements.
Ruby 1.8 feature change: instance_methods includes protected methods.
Ruby 1.8 feature: Array#push accepts any number of arguments.
Ruby 1.8.x comes with Racc runtime module, you need NOT distribute Racc runtime files.
Ruby 1.9 feature change: Enumerable#collect without block returns an Enumerator.
Ruby 1.9 has Date#to_time which converts to localtime only.
Ruby 1.9 has Date#xmlschema which converts to a string without the time component.
Ruby 1.9 only supports basic whitespace
Ruby 1.9 uses passive mode by default.
Ruby 1.9.x has introduced some things that are awkward, and we need to support them, so we define some constants to use later.
Ruby 2.0 doesn't see Proc as Binding
Ruby 2.0 will have type send every time, and "send nil" if it is calling itself with a specified "self" receiver
Ruby 2.2.2 will have type lvar if it is calling its own method without a specified "self"

Ruby converts your string into a hash
Ruby does not support `File.lutime` yet.
Ruby doesn't have libraries to support the compress (Lempel-Ziv) compression, so that is not supported.
Ruby expects the argument to be a string and can't convert objects like a hash or array.
Ruby has to allocate memory for the splat expansion every time that the `case` `when` statement is run.
Ruby running in Cygwin
Ruby scripts (i.e. source files with a shebang in the first line) are ignored.
Ruby seems to be depending on HOME in those code samples.
Ruby ships with a custom_require, override its require
Ruby's Tempfile class would work really great for this, except GC can come along and  remove the file before we are done with it.
Ruby's fork only copies the running process (which would be us), so if we return from this thread, it results in a zombie Ruby process.
Ruby/C like octal/hexadecimal/binary integer format, to be converted to Integer.
RubyGems can activate all the gems in your dependencies file at startup using the RUBYGEMS_GEMDEPS environment variable or through Gem.use_gemdeps.
RubyGems defaults are stored in rubygems/defaults.rb.
RubyGems has several different security policies.
RubyGems is currently maintained by Eric Hodel.
RubyGems options use symbol keys.
RubyGems recommends saving this as gem.deps.rb over Gemfile or Isolate.
RubyGems uses the default configured sources if no source was given.
RubyGems was originally developed at RubyConf 2003 by:
RubyGems will automatically find your key and certificate in your home directory and use them to sign newly packaged gems.
Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:
Run Site#process and catch errors
Run UDP/IP server loop on the given sockets.

Running a pre-release Xcode on a pre-release OS is expected and likely to cause less problems than a stable Xcode will.
Running both things in the same process is a recipe for a night with paracetamol.
Running several Rake tasks in a single command would trip up the runner, as the patterns would also contain the other Rake tasks.
Running that line here causes the SHOW TABLES result to be cached so we don't have to do it again in the block.
Running this method in the above shell would then return:
Runs EXPLAIN on the query or queries triggered by this relation and returns the result as a string.

SQL vs Model Load/Exists
SQLite 3.8.2 returns a newly formatted error message: UNIQUE constraint failed: *table_name*.*column_name* Older versions of SQLite return: column *column_name* is not unique
SQLite supports index names up to 64 characters.
SQLite3 will not allow you to add a NOT NULL column to a table without a default value.
SSH configuration information mock
SSH requires that permissions on the private key are 0600 on POSIX based systems.
SSL features cannot be tested
SSL server doesn't cache sessions so get_cb is called next time.
SSLConfig handles the needed SSL information for establishing a DRbSSLSocket connection, including generating the X509 / RSA pair.
SSLError, not RuntimeError
SSL_SESSION_time keeps long value so we can't keep nsec fragment.

Seconds to wait until a connection is opened.
Seconds to wait until reading one block (by one read(1) call).
Seconds to wait while attempting to open a connection.

Setting CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK to "LAST" tells CMake to search for our libraries before trying to utilize Frameworks, many of which will be from 3rd party installs.
Setting behaviors only affects deprecations that happen after boot time.
Setting it to +true+ will _always_ save the members, whereas setting it to +false+ will _never_ save the members.
Setting it to nil is useful to re-enable template lookup overriding a previous configuration set in the parent:
Setting the :extname option will control what extension (if any) is appended to the url for assets
Setting the default to +nil+ effectively drops the default:
Setting the layout to nil forces it to be looked up in the filesystem and fallbacks to the parent behavior if none exists.
Setting the value object to +nil+ has the effect of writing +nil+ to all mapped attributes.
Setting this check to "always" and "when_needed" makes sense only for code that should support Ruby 1.9, since in 2.0+ utf-8 is the default source file encoding.
Setting this flag comes at the price in the form of a performance loss.
Setting this is useful when you want delivery notifications sent to a different address than the one in +:from+.

Similarly if parent class changes the value then that would change the value of subclasses too.
Similarly you can go through a #has_one association on the join model:
Similarly, a simple hash without a statement will generate conditions based on equality with the SQL AND operator.
Similarly, if any of the +before_remove+ callbacks throw an exception, the object will not be removed from the collection.
Similarly, if the parent class changes the value, the value of subclasses is not changed.
Similarly, if you want it to also look up in the rails namespace, you just need to provide the :in value:
Similarly, pass `--include-optional` to include `:optional` :    dependencies.
Similarly, you can show all global variables with +v g+:

Since +audio_url+ is based on +asset_url+ method you can set :host options.
Since +font_url+ is based on +asset_url+ method you can set :host options.
Since +image_url+ is based on +asset_url+ method you can set :host options.
Since +javascript_url+ is based on +asset_url+ method you can set :host options.
Since +stylesheet_url+ is based on +asset_url+ method you can set :host options.
Since +video_url+ is based on +asset_url+ method you can set :host options.
Since Active Record can figure out the ID of any fixture from its label, you can specify FK's by label instead of ID.
Since HTML and JavaScript requests are typically made from the browser, we need to ensure to verify request authenticity for the web browser.
Since Hash#each is unordered in 1.8, sort the keys and iterate that way so the tests are deterministic on all implementations.
Since IPv6 addresses are wrapped by brackets in URIs, this method returns IPv6 addresses wrapped by brackets.
Since MonitorMixin.new_cond returns a ConditionVariable, and the example above calls while_wait and signal, this class should be documented.
Since REXML is non-validating, this method is not implemented as it requires a DTD
Since RFC 2822 permit comments, the regexp has no right anchor.
Since RSS is based on XML, it must have opening and closing tags that match.
Since Rails::Railtie cannot be instantiated, any methods that call +instance+ are intended to be called only on subclasses of a Railtie.
Since Ruby 1.8, REXML is included in the standard Ruby distribution.
Since Ruby does not support fall through inside of `case` `when`, like some other languages do, the order of the `when` branches does not matter.
Since UserInteraction dispatches to a concrete UI class you may need to reference other classes for specific behavior such as Gem::ConsoleUI or Gem::SilentUI.
Since autocorrect changes a number of lines, and not only the line where the reported offending range is, we avoid auto-correction if this cop has already found other offenses is the same range.
Since cache entries in most instances will be serialized, the internals of this class are highly optimized using short instance variable names that are lazily defined.
Since classes don't know their subclasses, we have to build the hierarchy between self and the record's class.
Since client_addr is not an IP address of this host, bind() in TCPSocket.new should fail as EADDRNOTAVAIL.
Since escaping tags is now default, this can be used when you don't want Rails to automatically escape tags.
Since fixtures are a testing construct, we use them in our unit and functional tests.
Since it always passes a ::JSON::State object as the only argument to to_json, we can detect that and forward the calls to the original to_json method.
Since it is implemented by the standard library module Find, Find.prune can be used to control the traversal.
Since it's not easy to get the position of the "else" keyword, we check "else" body against latest "when" keyword indentation.
Since jobs share a single thread pool, long-running jobs will block short-lived jobs.
Since minitest only loads plugins if its extensions are empty we have to call `load_plugins` first.
Since most emails do something interesting with database data, you'll need to write some scenarios to load messages with fake data:
Since only one table is loaded at a time, conditions or orders cannot reference tables other than the main one.
Since some of them reopen ActiveSupport::Deprecation its autoload would be triggered, resulting in a circular require warning for active_support/deprecation.rb.
Since the +notice+ and +alert+ keys are a common idiom, convenience accessors are available:
Since the IP address may not be needed, we store the object here without calculating the IP to keep from slowing down the majority of requests.
Since the argument is the object that the given block shall make calls on to build something based on the enumerable that each_with_object iterates over, an immutable argument makes no sense.
Since the change could (theoretically) introduce parsing errors, we break the loop if we find any.
Since the order is incomplete nothing will be shown
Since the preloader for habtm gets raw row hashes from the database and then instantiates them, this test ensures that it only instantiates one actual object per record from the database.
Since the source has a trailing newline, there is a final empty line
Since there are numerous conflicts among locally defined time zone abbreviations all over the world, this method is not intended to understand all of them.
Since there is overhead, values must be large enough to warrant compression.
Since these exceptions are captured in transaction blocks, the parent block does not see it and the real transaction is committed.
Since this formatter does not alter whitespace nodes, the results of formatting already formatted XML will be odd.
Since this is a subclass of the RDoc markup parser there isn't much to see here, unfortunately.
Since this is currently depending on Redcarpet to cooperate, we are going to be naive, and only allow line highlighting when a language is specified.
Since this is currently only called for docs, we can be lazy and just say it's documentation.
Since this key is generated only once during the request, it speeds up all cache accesses.
Since we could use these values as Host header, we choose the initial(first) value.
Since we define a new cop class, we have to do this in a separate process.
Since we don't want the callbacks to get defined multiple times, there are guards that check if the save or validation methods have already been defined before actually defining them.
Since we have no idea, if we are concerned about IP spoofing we need to give up and explode.
Since we keep references from children to parents and not just the other way around, we cannot update an AST and share identical subtrees.
Since we're processing the view in a different thread, copy the thread locals from the main thread to the child thread.
Single byte optimization
SingleForwardable can be used to setup delegation at the object level as well.
Singleton instance of the server
Singular names are not handled correctly:

Small Roman Numeral One
Small internal convenience method to get the parsed version of the current content type header.
Small macro to add ruby as an option to the generator with proper default value plus an instance helper method called shebang.
Small safeguard against potentially unwanted rm-rf, since the default machine folder will typically always be greater than 10 characters long.
Sneakers is being used in production for both I/O and CPU intensive workloads, and have achieved the goals of high-performance and 0-maintenance, as designed.
Snow Leopard defines an NCURSES value the opposite of most distros.
So +0000 is a local time such as Europe/London, etc.
So +associations+ could look like this:
So 29s gets rounded down to 0m, 30s gets rounded up to 1m, and 1m29s gets rounded down to 1m.
So Berkeley DB header with GDBM library causes the problem.
So HTTP_PROXY is not used.
So I will close the connection in every response.
So IO::WaitReadable can be used to rescue the exceptions for retrying accept_nonblock.
So IO::WaitReadable can be used to rescue the exceptions for retrying read_nonblock.
So IO::WaitReadable can be used to rescue the exceptions for retrying recv_nonblock.
So IO::WaitReadable can be used to rescue the exceptions for retrying recvfrom_nonblock.
So IO::WaitWritable can be used to rescue the exceptions for retrying connect_nonblock.
So IO::WaitWritable can be used to rescue the exceptions for retrying write_nonblock.
So OpenSSL::Buffering#write_nonblock needs two rescue clause as follows.
So RUBY_PLATFORM in this process is not useful to detect it.
So a join between Developer and Project will give the default join table name of "developers_projects" because "D" precedes "P" alphabetically.
So a plugin can be at `plugins/foo` or also at `plugins/foo/bar`, but no deeper.
So all tests will cause failure.
So although this class does not explicitly document all instance methods supported by File, you can in fact call any File instance method on a Tempfile object.
So application should close it explicitly.
So application should close it.
So as an example, 0x677E is the same as "E69DBE" (but somewhat easier to produce and check).
So basically you should use transaction blocks whenever you have a number of statements that must be executed together or not at all.
So check t1 and t0 are in error by less than one millisecond.
So concurrent mechanism, thread for example, should be used to service multiple clients at a time.
So descendants of MyApp::Business::Account would appear as MyApp::Business::AccountSubclass.
So don't use /tmp/malicious-users-directory/socket.
So either extending the provided method below, or rolling your own is required.
So for example you may use a named route directly.
So for instance, 3.10 sorts higher than 3.2 because ten is greater than two.
So gemspecs created under these versions of Syck will have references to Syck::DefaultKey.
So if it is not needed to run callbacks for each update, it is preferred to use #update_all for updating all records using a single query.
So if no month select is available, January will be assumed.
So if set to "basecamp_", all table names will be named like "basecamp_projects", "basecamp_people", etc.
So if the predicate returns +true+ the attribute will become +false+.
So if you have "myapp_" as a prefix, the table name guess for an Invoice class becomes "myapp_invoices".
So in the above, the error message would be the translation of "vagrant.errors.my_error"
So in the example above, the irregular rule for octopus will now be the first of the pluralization and singularization rules that is runs.
So instead of trusting certificates on a per-developer basis, we use the PKI concept of certificate chains to build a logical hierarchy of trust.
So it can be referenced later.
So it is a local time.
So it should be careful to use it.
So it's no catch-all for performance problems, but it's a great way to cut down on the number of queries in a situation as the one described above.
So it's possible that changing something outside of that call will still expire the cache.
So it's unneeded whether there are offenses or not.
So mismatch check is not performed for that.
So no packets should be generated.
So our Fiddle::Handle#sym must call dlerror(3) before call dlsym.
So pass the file name without the extension.
So passing a Workshop object will attempt to use the +workshop_path+ route.
So the example doc above will have this excerpt source:
So the key is copied to the home directory and chmod 0600.
So the task of this method is to merge them according to the following rules:
So the template digest for the current action is automatically included in the ETag.
So the the method argument nodes need to be processed in current scope.
So the three-lined example in "Using partials" can be rewritten with a single line:
So the value of path_info should be normalize before accessing to the filesystem.
So the values are scoped within the Thread.current space under the class name of the module.
So there is no need to eager load them.
So they update the counter cache.
So this feature will be removed.
So this method creates an array of scopes corresponding to the chain.
So this would be wrong:
So to work around this we first define with the __temp__ identifier, and then use alias method to rename it to what we want.
So we abbreviate the spec, making it much smaller for quicker downloads.
So we can access them easily.
So we can avoid the +method_missing+ hit by explicitly defining +#to_ary+ as +nil+ here.
So we check that initially parsed and reparsed duration added to time will result in the same time.
So we consider it's used to suppress false positive offenses.
So we create a whitelist here to allow overwriting certain files.
So we group by the classes as well.
So we need to be sure that we reference Syck at the toplevel too so that we can always load these kind of gemspecs.
So we need to force their encoding to binary before applying the regular expression to ensure we are escaping all characters properly.
So we need to require this upfront to ensure we don't get a false failure, but ideally we should just fix the BigDecimal core_ext to not change to_s without arguments.
So we need to store the path at file load and revert back to it after each test.
So we should build a relation to merge in rather than directly merging the values.
So we'll just skip it.
So what can be written like this:
So within mailers, you only have to type +url_for+ instead of 'ActionController::UrlFor#url_for' in full.
So you shouldn't use it for elements that will be fragment cached.
So you specify the object you want messaged on a given callback.
So you'd have a concern something like this:
So, any mass-assignment idiom like
So, any strong parameters idiom like:
So, at operator assignment node, we need to reference the variable before processing rhs nodes.
So, for example, if we had a _local_ variable +post+ representing an existing record,
So, if we had a comments page and wanted to render a "Go Back" link instead of a link to the comments page, we could do something like this...
So, in that alternative implementation, the special cases would propagate outside this class, including the use of tar or equivalent.
So, it is suitable for factorizing an integer which is not large but has many prime factors.
So, the #parent attribute needs to be mutable.
So, the target may be non-empty and still lack children waiting to be read from the database.
So, to dup an arbitrary object you normally use an optimistic approach and are ready to catch an exception, say:
So, try to check header/library mismatch.
So, using a block, you might do something as simple as limit the actions available on certain resources, passing standard resource options through the concern:
So, we define the constant first, and load dependencies later.
So, we have to rearrange things so that the request looks like this (url-encoded):
Socket#accept_nonblock may raise any error corresponding to accept(2) failure, including Errno::EWOULDBLOCK.
Socket#connect_nonblock may raise any error corresponding to connect(2) failure, including Errno::EINPROGRESS.
Socket#recvfrom_nonblock may raise any error corresponding to recvfrom(2) failure, including Errno::EWOULDBLOCK.
Socket.getaddrinfo(left, nil, Socket::AF_INET6, Socket::SOCK_STREAM, nil, Socket::AI_NUMERICHOST)
Socket.tcp_server_loop succeeds if one socket can be used at least.
Socket.udp_server_loop can be implemented using this method as follows.
SocketError:: Hostname not known or other socket error.
Software is unlikely to link against libraries from build-time deps, so it doesn't matter if they link against different C++ stdlibs.
Software that will not be sym-linked into the `brew --prefix` will only live in its Cellar.
Solaris returns IPv4 address for ::ffff:1.2.3.4.
Solaris/OpenSolaris/Illumos uses SunSSH which doesn't support the IdentitiesOnly option.
Solve complex equations
Some Ansible options must be passed as environment variables, as there is no equivalent command line arguments
Some CDNs only support strong ETags and will ignore weak ETags entirely.
Some ORM systems do not use IDs on nested models so in this case you want to be able to disable the hidden id.
Some are aliased such as "rails:migration" and can be invoked with the shorter "migration", others are private to other generators such as "css:scaffold".
Some arguments may be passed via environment variables:
Some arithmetic expressions including parenthesis can be generated as follows.
Some arithmetic expressions using "+", "-", "*" and "/" are generated as follows.
Some cache implementation may optimize this method.
Some commands define their documentation differently.
Some commands like +remove_column+ cannot be reversed.
Some common code shared between FavorUnlessOverNegatedIf and FavorUntilOverNegatedWhile.
Some configuration can be passed through +options+.
Some configuration options like :group make it impossible to do an SQL count, in those cases the array count will be used.
Some configure scripts won't find libxml2 without help
Some constants, such as "true" resolve to booleans, so the above error checking doesn't catch it.
Some databases impose a limit on the number of ids in a list (in Oracle it's 1000) Make several smaller queries if necessary or make one query if the adapter supports it
Some documentation comment...
Some examples are appropriate at this point.
Some extensions can only be made to work with knowledge of the association's internals.
Some extra features are included to take advantage of Ruby's style and strengths.
Some familiar aliases for the SecHandle structure
Some gems consist of pre-compiled code ("binary gems").
Some gems contain C (or other) code to be compiled into a Ruby "extension".
Some header fields should not be transferred.
Some human-friendly output
Some just fix the data:
Some libraries call this directly, so keeping it around for compatibility.
Some linkers produce multiple `LC_LOAD_DYLIB` load commands for the same library, but at this point we're really only interested in a list of unique libraries this Mach-O file links to, thus: `uniq`.
Some local variables fix the problem.
Some methods provided here will only work in the context of a request (link_to_unless_current, for instance), which must be provided as a method called #request on the context.
Some not very comprehensive tests of block behavior.
Some of the documentation is in this class, some in the modules CGI::QueryExtension and CGI::HtmlExtension.
Some of these flags are mutually exclusive.
Some of these gems do not call to_s implicitly.
Some of these parts are high-level: paragraphs, chunks of verbatim text, list entries and the like.
Some other useful accessors (mon_count and some queue stuff) are also in this module, and don't appear directly in the RDoc output.
Some parts adapted from http://golang.org/src/pkg/json/decode.go and http://golang.org/src/pkg/utf8/utf8.go
Some port configuration
Some projects might prefer to use exception classes which more precisely identify the nature of the error.)
Some reserved IP v.4 addresses
Some software links metafiles together, so by the time we iterate to one of them we may have already moved it.
Some software symlinks these files (see help2man.rb)
Some special arrangements have to be made for operator methods.
Some systems are broken and have it in /bin
Some systems return an exit code 1 for some reason.
Some tags must only exist a specific number of times in a given RSS feed.
Some tests need two paths.
Some things may be non-dry for a reason.
Some times you don't care about the content of the fixtures as much as you care about the volume.
Some times you'll have template dependencies that can't be derived at all.
Some transcoding must take place, of course, to accomplish this multiencoding support.
Some transformations are destructive in a manner that cannot be reversed.
Some versions of `mktmpdir` return absolute paths, which will break make if the paths contain spaces.
Some wrappers are non-functional and will return a non-zero exit code when invoked for version info.
Something like this should look familiar:
Something went horribly wrong.
Sometime in the 1.9 dev cycle, the Syck constant was moved from under YAML to be a toplevel constant.
Sometimes benchmark results are skewed because code executed earlier encounters different garbage collection overheads than that run later.
Sometimes cygpath isn't available (msys).
Sometimes it is useful to have access to the owner object when building the query.
Sometimes non-ASCII characters will garble the site index.  Non-ASCII characters will be replaced by their XML entity equivalent.
Sometimes the code needs that the callbacks execute in a specific order.
Sometimes we accidentally install files outside prefix.
Sometimes we have to change a bit before we install.
Sometimes you do not want to subscribe to an event for the entire life of the application.
Sometimes you may want to isolate engine, but use helpers that are defined for it.
Sometimes you need to set up the session and cookie variables for a test.
Sometimes you want to alternate layouts depending on runtime information, such as whether someone is logged in or not.
Sometimes you want to be able to read the raw attribute data without having the column-determined typecast run its course first.
Sometimes you'll have exceptions where one action wants to use a different layout than the rest of the controller.
Sometimes you'll want to add a column in a migration and populate it immediately after.
Sometimes, VBoxManage fails but doesn't actual return a non-zero exit code.
Sometimes, you have a resource that clients always look up without referencing an ID.

TSort implements topological sorting using Tarjan's algorithm for strongly connected components.
TSort is designed to be able to be used with any object which can be interpreted as a directed graph.
TSort requires two methods to interpret an object as a graph, tsort_each_node and tsort_each_child.
Tab.for_keg(head_prefix) will be fetched from CACHE but we write it anyway
Table aliases are automatically truncated according to the maximum length of table identifiers according to the specific database.
Table names + table aliases
Tables allow you to work with the data by row or column, manipulate the data, and even convert the results back to CSV, if needed.
Tabs are not allowed.
Tag the source with the default external encoding or the encoding specified in the file
TagMaker Mixin module providing HTML generation methods.
Tags are declared in the server but computed in the connection.
Tags can pass content to embed within it:
Take a simple example where the layout expects the template to tell which title to use:
Take a string with embedded escapes, and convert the escapes as the Ruby interpreter would when reading a double-quoted string literal.
Take callback names and an optional callback proc, normalize them, then call the block with each callback.
Take care of the broken text/xml entry by renaming or deleting it
Take care when implementing a plugin as your plugin file may be loaded multiple times if multiple versions of your gem are installed.
Take control of all existing connections so a "group" action such as reload/disconnect can be performed safely.
Take each matcher and replace it with emptiness.
Take for instance Active Record subscriber tests:
Take into account that this does not include helpers defined in controllers with helper_method or other similar solutions, only helpers defined in the helpers directory will be included.
Take note that in that last case, the results are sorted in ascending order:
Take search results -- a hash mapping formula names to descriptions -- and print them.
Take the following route definition as an example:
Take the text and format it, indented two spaces for each line, and wrapped at 72 columns:
Taken from http://yaml.org/type/float.html
Taken from http://yaml.org/type/int.html
Taken from http://yaml.org/type/timestamp.html
Takes +indent+ arg, but does nothing with it.
Takes +label+ option.
Takes a String and parses it out
Takes a block and queues a new group that is indented 1 level further.
Takes a connection URL.
Takes a hash as its argument.
Takes a path to a file.
Takes a return result from an SSPI function and interprets the value.
Takes a single argument which is to be treated like a hashtable, or defaults to ENV, the system environment.
Takes a slug and turns it into a simple title.
Takes a token and gets the next token in the Negotiate authentication chain.
Takes an action name and returns the name of the method that will handle the action.
Takes an element or elements or array of elements.
Takes an indented string and removes the preceding spaces on each line
Takes an optional argument +i+, which specifies how many callers up the stack to look.
Takes any object which implements the each_pair method, including Hash and DBM objects.
Takes in a limit and checks if the attributes_collection has too many records.
Takes in an array of nested modules and extracts the last module
Takes raw_params and turns it into an array of parameters
Takes the arguments that will be passed to the perform method.
Takes the environment such as +:production+ or +:development+.
Takes the first digit of the reply code to determine the status type
Takes the line number of a given code line and returns a string containing the previous line that's not a comment line or a blank line.
Takes the same argument as GetoptLong.new.

Tasks and dependencies are specified in standard Ruby syntax.
Technically MySQL allows to create indexes with the sort order syntax but at the moment (5.5) it doesn't yet implement them
Technically it should be possible to make it work with SSH too, but we don't yet.
Technically other types of keys are accepted:
Technically this method can be used to fetch terminal values:

Tell clang/gcc where system include's are:
Tell local rsync how to invoke remote rsync with sudo
Tell the user about any caveats regarding this package.
Tempfile itself however may not be entirely thread-safe.
Tempfile's filename picking method is both thread-safe and inter-process-safe: it guarantees that no other threads or processes will pick the same filename.
Template lookup accounts for the action name, locales, format, variant, template handlers, and more (see +render+ for details).
Template's mime type is used if no content_type is specified
Templates can be used concurrently in threaded environments so compilation and any instance variable modification must be synchronized
Templates can share variables amongst themselves by using instance variables defined using the regular embedding tags.
Templates in the collection not already cached are written to cache.
Templates may generate a "see also ..." if this method/attribute has documentation, and "see ..." if it does not.

Thanks for your patience.
Thanks to Gavin Sinclair for some feedback on the documentation.
Thanks to Hal Fulton for hosting the Codefest.
Thanks to James Tucker for the Gem tricks involved in this call.
Thanks to Matz for suggestions about the class design.
Thanks to repeated auto-correction, we can get rid of the trailing spaces, and then the extra empty line.
Thanks to whoever made it.
That action implicitly responds to all formats, but formats can also be whitelisted:
That carries the usual limitations.
That child may be one of:
That code returns right away, you are just subscribing to "render" events.
That could be weird, but if we parse P1Y1M0.5D and output it to ISO 8601, we'll get P1Y1MT12.0H.
That does not depend on whether the collection has already been loaded or not.
That first executes the block and then notifies all subscribers once done.
That gives us a more consistent picture of everything, but creates a pretty strong Observer Effect.
That intermediary AST is then translated in to a Ruby object graph.
That is automatically set to ascending on the primary key ("id ASC") to make the batch ordering consistent.
That is automatically set to ascending on the primary key ("id ASC") to make the batch ordering work.
That is, a normal hash merge, with the addition that any value that is a hash, and occurs in both arguments, will also be merged.
That is, at each point in time, at most one thread may be executing any of its methods.
That is, do not execute statements like 'CREATE TABLE' inside such blocks.
That is, entities have been expanded to their values
That is, for every element that is an array, * extract its elements into the new array.
That is, that we can pass the basic test and the /proc/version returns nothing to us.
That is, the attribute with entities intact.
That is, the contents of the old V1 box will be destroyed or moved.
That is, the request API client will handle the session for you instead of Rails.
That is: row +i+, column +j+.
That makes for an almost textbook perfect example of how to use delegation.
That means it does not have headers or a body.
That means that modifying attributes of the clone will modify the original, since they will both point to the same attributes hash.
That means that the message will be sent bypassing checking +perform_deliveries+ and +raise_delivery_errors+, so use with caution.
That means you have to take special care not to do anything silly in a channel that would balloon its memory footprint or whatever.
That object knows how to convert the events to a YAML document.
That one is particularly useful for serving assets from an SSL-protected page.
That rescue is very expensive (like 40 times slower than a predicate), and it is often triggered.
That said, when streaming, you need to properly check your templates and choose when to use +provide+ and +content_for+.
That way, the middleware will ignore those IP addresses, and return the one that you want.
That will ensure all the data transferred via HTTPS protocol and prevent the user from getting their session hijacked when accessing the site over unsecured HTTP protocol.
That will set the +target_prefix+ in the generated Makefile to "test".
That works that way because the involved helpers know whether the resource is a new record or not, and generate HTML accordingly.
That would add something like "Process data files (345.2ms)" to the log, which you can then use to compare timings when optimizing your code.
That would just give each lambda the same reference and they would all get the last value of each.
That's a string with the absolute path of the asset, for example "/assets/rails.png".
That's an instance of the class ActiveRecord::Reflection::AssociationReflection.
That's done by replacing the question marks with symbols and supplying a hash with values for the matching symbol keys:
That's how you typically work with resources.
That's the case with our +balance+ attribute.
That's what you want the bulk of the time.
That's why a JSON string is returned.
That's why this is much more elaborate than the string version.
The  former  will  find the  first  occurrence  of the desired symbol using the default library search order.
The "central auto-correction engine" can't handle intermediate states where the code has syntax errors, so it's important to fix the trailing whitespace in this cop.
The "cleaned" relative path is the relative path without the extname and with the collection's directory removed as well.
The "proper provider" in this case depends on what was given:
The #after_commit callback is the only one that is triggered once the update is committed.
The #belongs_to association is always used in the model that has the foreign key.
The #css extension enables CSS blocks to be included in the output, but they are not used for any built-in RDoc output format.
The #default_scope is also applied while creating/building a record.
The #description should be more detailed than the summary.
The #find_each method uses #find_in_batches with a batch size of 1000 (or as specified by the +:batch_size+ option).
The #notes extension enables footnote support.
The #path is gleaned from the +SCRIPT_NAME+ environment variable, and #secure is false.
The #speak action simply uses the Chat::Room object that was created when the channel was first subscribed to by the consumer when that subscriber wants to say something in the room.
The #transaction method is also available as a model instance method.
The #value_for and #set_value_for methods are delegated to the current ScopeRegistry object, so the above example code can also be called as:
The '.' lets us handle SWIG-generated files
The 'value_of_e' field is defined as 'DECIMAL' with precision/scale explicitly left out.
The (S)FTP host to use.
The +#is_alias_for+ method/attribute, if any, is not included.
The +:Realm+ is used to provide different access to different groups across several resources on a server.
The +:force+ option is useful when you're calling some other method to ask whether you should force a cache write.
The +:nodoc+ visibility ignores all directives related to visibility.
The +:notnew:+ directive stops this.
The +:path+, +:as+, +:module+, +:shallow_path+ and +:shallow_prefix+ options all default to the name of the namespace.
The +Find+ module supports the top-down traversal of a set of file paths.
The +FormBuilder+ object can be thought of as serving as a proxy for the methods in the +FormHelper+ module.
The +FormBuilder+ object is yielded when using +form_for+ or +fields_for+.
The +Matrix+ class represents a mathematical matrix.
The +ParamsWrapper+ will actually try to determine the list of attribute names from the model and only wrap those attributes:
The +Path+ object is simply an enumerable and allows you to easily add extra paths:
The +String+ MIME type of the request.
The +TemplateRenderer+ and +PartialRenderer+ objects are wrappers which do all the setup and logic necessary to render a view and a new object is created each time +render+ is called.
The +Ticker+ publishes a time and a price, and the warners receive that.
The +Vector+ class represents a mathematical vector, which is useful in its own right, and also constitutes a row or column of a Matrix.
The +accept+ method on OptionParser may be used to create converters.
The +add+ method accepts the following options as arguments: eager_load, autoload, autoload_once, and glob.
The +address+ should be a DNS hostname or IP address, the +port+ is the port the server operates on.
The +address+ should be a DNS hostname or IP address.
The +as+ option sets the format to JSON, sets the content type to "application/json" and encodes the parameters as JSON.
The +attributes+ parameter can be either a Hash or an Array of Hashes.
The +auth_type+ parameter is a string that represents the authentication mechanism to be used.
The +authenticate_or_request_with_http_digest+ block must return the user's password or the ha1 digest hash so the framework can appropriately hash to check the user's credentials.
The +authenticator+ is an object which defines a process() method to handle authentication with the server.
The +basename+ parameter is used to determine the name of the temporary file.
The +block_parser+ is used to for footnotes and labels in the inline text.
The +checked_value+ defaults to 1 while the default +unchecked_value+ is set to 0 which is convenient for boolean values.
The +class_name+ of the +attachable+ is passed as a String.
The +comments+ resource here will have the following routes generated for it:
The +config+ is completely unused, so passing nil is sufficient.
The +constants+ and +attributes+ collections are sorted.
The +custom_proxies+ argument can take an Array of string, IPAddr, or Regexp objects which will be used instead of +TRUSTED_PROXIES+.
The +defaults+ parameter is unused.
The +digest_algorithm+ is written to a read-only +name+.sum file following the given file contents containing the digest name and hexdigest separated by a tab.
The +div_radio_button+ code from above can now be used as follows:
The +envelope+ parameters dictates whether or not the resultant plist fragment is wrapped in the normal XML/plist header and footer.
The +errors+ property of this exception contains an array of AttributeAssignmentError objects that should be inspected to determine which attributes triggered the errors.
The +exit+ command, or ::irb_exit, will quit the current session and call any exit hooks with IRB.irb_at_exit.
The +expires_in+ parameter can override the value set when the entry was created.
The +extension+ argument allows you to pass a block into a has_and_belongs_to_many association.
The +extension+ argument allows you to pass a block into a has_many association.
The +extensions+ restrict the key to the indicated uses.
The +extras+ hash allows you to specify options that would normally be provided as a query string to the action.
The +extras+ parameter is used to tell the request the names and values of additional request parameters that would be in a query string.
The +facility+ may be set to specify the facility level which will be used.
The +force_restore_state+ argument indicates if the record state should be rolled back to the beginning or just to the last savepoint.
The +form+ can be either :utc or :local (default :local).
The +func+ shall be either mere function name or function name with arguments.
The +get_attribute_ns+ method retrieves a method by its namespace and name.
The +given_day_in_next_week+ defaults to the beginning of the week which is determined by +Date.beginning_of_week+ or +config.beginning_of_week+ when set.
The +helper+ class method can take a series of helper module names, a block, or both.
The +id+ parameter must match the constraint passed in for this example.
The +info+ hash is optional, and if given is used to define metadata about the current schema (currently, only the schema's version):
The +input+ and +output+ arguments can be anything CSV::new() accepts (generally String or IO objects).
The +installer+ will be +nil+ if a gem matching the request was already installed.
The +ip_spoofing_check+ option is on by default.
The +irb+ command from your shell will start the interpreter.
The +key+ argument can also respond to +cache_key+ or +to_param+.
The +limit+ may be anything that can evaluate to a string via #to_s.
The +message+ parameter allows you to pass in an error message that is displayed upon failure.
The +message+ parameter allows you to specify a custom error message for assertion failures.
The +message+ parameter allows you to specify a custom error message to display upon failure.
The +name+ is only used to track the repository back to a gem dependencies file, it has no real significance as a git repository may contain multiple gems.
The +name+, +version+ and +platform+ are the name, version and platform of the gem.
The +new_session+ option can be used to either always or never create a new session.
The +null+ flag indicates whether the value can be +NULL+.
The +offset+ can be used to locate duplicate header names, as described in CSV::Row.field().
The +options+ argument must be a hash whose keys are *symbols*.
The +options+ hash accepts the same keys as SchemaStatements#add_foreign_key.
The +options+ hash is passed downwards:
The +options+ hash is passed to each annotation's +to_s+.
The +options+ parameter can be anything CSV::new() understands.
The +options+ parameter is also filtered down to CSV::new() after some clever key parsing.
The +options+ supports two additional keys for convenience and conformance:
The +precision+ parameter can be used to limit seconds' precision of duration.
The +prefix+ for this Notifier, which is appended to all objects being inspected during output.
The +rdoc+ object passed to the block is an RDoc::Task object.
The +sec+ option for the write, take, move, read and notify methods may either be a number of seconds or a Renewer object.
The +section+, the section's +constants+ and the sections +attributes+ are yielded.
The +selected+ parameter must be either +nil+, or a string that names an ActiveSupport::TimeZone.
The +sep+ argument from ::new
The +set+ contains other specifications for this (URL) +source+.
The +set+ parameter is a number or a range between two numbers, or an array of those.
The +set+ parameter is a number, an array of numbers, or a Range object.
The +signer+ is used to add a digest file using its digest_algorithm per add_file_digest and a cryptographic signature in +name+.sig.
The +size+ method is the one that takes the loaded flag into account and delegates to +count_records+ if needed.
The +source+ can be a full path or a file.
The +source+ can be full path or file that exists in your public audios directory.
The +source+ is either where the +spec+ came from, or should be loaded from.
The +source+ is ignored.
The +sources+ can be full paths or files that exists in your public videos directory.
The +sql+ parameter is a full SQL query as a string.
The +src+ argument is meant to be an image file path.
The +srcprefix+ argument can be used to override the default source directory, i.e. the current directory.
The +srcprefix+ should be used when your source files are not in the same directory as your build script.
The +subscribe+ method returns a subscriber object:
The +target+ name should correspond the name of the global function name defined within your C extension, minus the +Init_+.
The +tuple+ must be the same size as the template.
The +type+ and +options+ parameters will be ignored if present.
The +type+ should be a full HTTP content type, e.g. "text/html".
The +update+ callback allows the warners to run without being explicitly called.
The +url+ may be an +http:+-type link or a cross-reference to a class, module or method with a label.
The +values+ are the options that can be selected from the Select menu.
The --no-color CLI option sets `color: false` so we don't want the `no_color` key, which is created automatically.
The -h and -R flags cannot be combined, and behavior is dependent on whether the file argument has a trailing slash.
The -isysroot is needed, too, because of the Frameworks
The -o option can change the output filename.
The .other directory is explicitly included, so the configuration file is read, and modifies the behavior.
The .pem files generated by --build and --sign are PEM files.
The .rubocop.yml file inherits from default.yml where the Include config parameter is set for the rails cops.
The 3-element array should contains cmsg_level, cmsg_type and data.
The :ProxyContentHandler proc will be invoked before sending a response to the User-Agent.
The :alias_path option will be used if the formula is found not to be installed, and discarded if it is installed because the alias_path used to install the formula will be set instead.
The :call-seq: is indented from the baseline.
The :category: directive will override the :section: directive.
The :markup: directive tells RDoc which format to use.
The :section: directive is sticky, so subsequent methods, aliases, attributes, and classes will be contained in this section until the section is changed.
The ABC size is based on assignments, branches (method calls), and conditions.
The ABI of the Function.
The API depends on four methods:
The API has the same methods as ActiveRecord, but each method returns a string that matches the ORM API.
The AS::JSON encoder requires the BigDecimal core_ext, which, unfortunately, changes the BigDecimal#to_s output, and consequently the JSON gem output.
The AST can be examined and manipulated freely.
The Accept header to send.
The Application is also responsible for building the middleware stack.
The Async adapter runs jobs with an in-process thread pool.
The Atlas token to use.
The Atom format is described in http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287

The XML builder seems to fail miserably when trying to tag something with the same name as a Kernel method (throw, test, loop, select ...)
The XQuartz that Apple shipped in OS X through 10.7 does not have a pkg-util entry, so if Spotlight indexing is disabled we must make an educated guess as to what version is installed.
The YAML document is read from STDIN and written back out to STDERR:
The _msg_ is a string.
The _msg_src_ is a Socket::UDPSource object.
The _opts_ argument can be used to configure the generator.
The _opts_ argument is passed through to generate/parse respectively.
The _timeout_ specify the seconds for timeout.
The `Proc` objects returned will expect a single argument for the configuration object and are expected to mutate this configuration object.
The `cached: true` will make Action View's rendering read several templates from cache at once instead of one call per template.
The `case` node plus the first `when` score one complexity point together.
The `cwd` that this environment represents
The `depends_on` method in the formula DSL is used to declare dependencies and requirements.
The `elsif` node will get an `on_if` call from the framework later, but we're done here, so we set it to ignored.
The `name` should be a symbol and must uniquely identify the data being given.
The `threads` method setting takes two numbers a minimum and maximum.
The `wget` :    formula serves as a simple example.
The above URI indicates that the client should connect to ftp.example.com then cd pub/ruby from the initial login directory.
The above YAML document consists of three lists, an outer list that contains two inner lists.
The above YAML document consists of three maps, an outer map that contains two inner maps.

The above examples should be enough to learn how to use this class.
The above invocation via `Utils.popen` can fail, causing the pipe to be prematurely closed (before we can write to it) and thus resulting in a broken pipe error.
The above script would generate the following extconf.h file:
The above tests that implicitly.
The above would yield 3 parts:
The absolute path to the given `path` and `parent`, unless the given path is absolute.

The accent bug, and the code that exhibits the bug, was contributed by Guilhem Vellut
The access sequence is defined by RFC 1738
The acronym, however, must occur as a delimited unit and not be part of another word for conversions to recognize it:
The activated gem's paths are inserted before site lib directory by default.
The active irb session
The actual before_action that is used to verify the CSRF token.
The actual file is accessible via the +tempfile+ accessor, though some of its interface is available directly for convenience.
The actual invocation is left up to the caller to minimize call stack pollution.
The actual method that is called is determined by calling method_for_action.
The actual proc added here is not executed, but merely stored.
The actual response object is generated automatically through the use of renders and redirects and requires no user intervention.
The actual return value of scanf when called with a block is an array containing the results of all the executions of the block.
The actual work method for adding converters, used by both CSV.convert() and CSV.header_convert().
The address of the Atlas server to upload to.

The allowed range of precision is from 0 to 6")
The alphabet uses '-' instead of '+' and '_' instead of '/'.
The anchor for this sequence (if any)
The anchor this alias links to
The anchor value (if there is one)
The apostrophes in "cats'" and "dogs'" suppress the flagging of these words as potential cross-references, which is necessary for the unit tests.
The application 'a' is installed as part of a gem, and this file is here to facilitate running it.
The application builder allows you to override elements of the application generator without being forced to reverse the operations of the default generator.
The application is also responsible for setting up and executing the booting process.
The application object is also responsible for holding the routes and reloading routes whenever the files change in development.
The application's location on the filesystem.
The argument +options+ is same as OpenURI::OpenRead#open.
The argument +size+ is the accumulated transferred size in bytes.
The argument _n_ specifies the length of the result string.
The argument _n_ specifies the length, in bytes, of the random number to be generated.
The argument _n_ specifies the length, of the random string to be generated.
The argument can take six forms:
The argument specification and the code to handle it are written in the same place.
The argument string is passed to the block in which it should be converted to the desired class.
The argument to the method can also be an array of fields.
The arguments +args+ are passed along to the summarize method which is called on every option.
The arguments are a list of sockets.
The arguments are interpreted as similar to self.
The arguments must be legal JSON types (string, int, float, nil, true, false, hash or array) or GlobalID::Identification instances.
The arguments to provide when executing the script.
The array does not include the default namespace declaration, if one exists.
The array form is to be used when the condition input is tainted and requires sanitization.
The array has each value sanitized and interpolated into the SQL statement.
The array is flattened, and all items, including the supplied separator, are HTML escaped unless they are HTML safe, and the returned string is marked as HTML safe.
The array is sorted from children to parents, i.e. the first element has no child and the last node has no parent.
The array is sorted from children to parents.
The array of files and list of directories cannot be changed after FileUpdateChecker has been initialized.
The array of names of environments where destructive actions should be prohibited.
The assertion is useful to test side effects.
The at_exit handler must be installed before anyone else gets a chance to install their own, that way we can be assured that our exit will be last to run (at_exit stacks).
The attribute is registered only if it defines a new method.
The attribute list of the open tag will also be escaped (for instance, the double-quotes surrounding attribute values).
The attribute name must be a valid method name in Ruby.
The attribute writer is named after the association, which means that in the following example, two new methods are added to your model:
The attributes and options can also be specified as a hash.
The attributes of the element are passed in as a hash, and the body as a no-argument block that evaluates to a String.
The attributes of the element are specified as a hash.
The attributes of the element can be specified as three arguments, +name+, +size+, and +maxlength+.
The attributes of the element can be specified as three arguments, +name+, +value+, and +checked+.
The attributes of the element can be specified as two arguments, +name+ and +value+.
The authenticity token is taken from the meta tag in this case
The autocorrect loop will handle that.
The autofixer will default to `start_of_line`.
The automatic guessing of the inverse association uses a heuristic based on the name of the class, so it may not work for all associations, especially the ones with non-standard names.
The available options are:
The available paths in an engine are:
The bang version of the parse method defaults to the more dangerous values for the _opts_ hash, so be sure only to parse trusted _source_ documents.
The base +Renderer+ class uses its +render+ method to delegate to the renderers.
The base class for a guest.
The base directory with file contents to upload.
The base exception for JSON errors.
The base filename of the document, without the file extname.
The base filename of the document.
The basename of the file in the client.
The basic idea for this cop was from the warning of `ruby -cw`:
The basic idea is that each thread checks out a database connection from the pool, uses that connection, and checks the connection back in.
The begin and end could also be braces, but we call the variables do...
The behavior is the same, it returns true if the collection based on the criteria has more than one record.
The behavior is the same, it returns true if the collection based on the criteria is not empty.
The below example shows how you can use this to provide performance introspection in the process:
The best thing to do is dump the stupid DTDs and use XMLSchema instead.
The best way to use this is by doing key-based cache expiration on top of a cache store like Memcached that'll automatically kick out old entries.
The biggest improvement over LowSecurity is that MediumSecurity won't install packages that are signed by untrusted sources.
The binary is cross-compiled.
The block body must have a single send without arguments to an lvar type.
The block form allows you to create potentially complex log messages, but to delay their evaluation until and unless the message is logged.
The block form also waits for the process when it returns.
The block form supports filtering.
The block given to the nested fields_for call will be repeated for each instance in the collection:
The block given will be called with a WEBrick::HTTPRequest with request info and a WEBrick::HTTPResponse which must be filled in appropriately:
The block is called from within a transaction, the object is already locked.
The block is called once for each element of the set, passing the element as parameter.
The block is called repeatedly with two arguments: The first is the option name.
The block is called with a socket and a client_address as an Addrinfo object.
The block is called with the message and its source information.
The block is invoked for each subsentence in preorder manner.
The block is invoked for each subsentence.
The block is invoked with the substituting string.
The block is saved and will be called whenever someone instruments "render":
The block is used to generate spaces.
The block must have a single, shortenable argument.
The block receives _msg_ and _msg_src_.
The block receives two arguments, an instance of the current class and the class to be invoked.
The block should return a class/module that has a method with the capability name, ready to be executed.
The block should return an Object that can be written to the logging device via +write+.
The block syntax also allows you to customize the part headers if desired:
The block syntax is also useful in providing information specific to a part:
The block takes two arguments, the first is the value paired with its key and the second is the remaining hash of options passed to +render+.
The block version of redirect allows for the easy encapsulation of any logic associated with the redirect in question.
The block will be called with the directive name and the directive parameter:
The block will create, run in and delete a temporary directory.
The block, based on that version, configures the environment.
The body assignment is last, since the loop variable bar has an assignment too.
The body is provided by the passed-in no-argument block
The body of the element is provided by the passed-in no-argument block.
The body of the element is the string returned by the no-argument block passed in.
The body of the html element is supplied as a block.
The boolean argument _padding_ specifies the padding.
The boolean false value is converted to the string false.
The boolean true value is converted to the string true.
The box that is backing this machine.
The built gem includes:
The bundled ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters distinguish unique index constraint errors from other types of database errors by throwing an ActiveRecord::RecordNotUnique exception.
The byte position in the source
The cache contains the following structures:
The cache directory seems like a good place to put patches.
The cache file has not been created because there was a symlink in its path.
The cache file will cause this to mostly be a no-op most of the time.
The cache is even shared across methods to make it even cheaper to use the macro-added methods without worrying too much about performance at the first go.
The cache is supposed to never expire.
The cache is thus automatically bumped whenever the project updated_at is touched.
The cache key generated from this call will be something like:
The cache key is built with a fingerprint of the sql query, the number of records matched by the query and a timestamp of the last updated record.
The cache responds that it's not valid, which means that new results should normally be collected and saved...
The caching is done using the +cache+ helper available in the Action View.
The call method must accept two arguments, params and request, and return a string.
The call returns the value of the block.
The callback implementation should be restricted to cleaning up caches, etc.
The callback is invoked with an SSLSocket and a server name.
The callback is invoked with the Session for the key exchange, an flag indicating the use of an export cipher and the keylength required.
The callback is unsubscribed automatically after that.
The callback must return an OpenSSL::PKey::DH instance of the correct key length.
The callback must return an SSLContext for the server name or nil.
The callback objects have methods named after the callback called with the record as the only parameter, such as:
The caller can specify what form of storage to use for the session's data with the +database_manager+ option to CGI::Session::new.
The caller is responsible for extracting the session id from the session_id attribute and manually encoding it in URLs and adding it as a hidden input to HTML forms created by other mechanisms.
The caller should care such errors and partial write.
The caller should care such errors.
The calling method must retry the exception to repeat the lookup.
The capitalization of the first word can be turned off by setting the +:capitalize+ option to false (default is true).
The capitalization of the first word can be turned off by setting the optional parameter +capitalize+ to false.
The capture method can be used in ERB templates...
The capture method extracts part of a template as a String object.
The case of explicitly lying about encodings via the normal Rails API should be handled inside Rails.
The catch-all rescue here is to support multiple Ruby versions, since we use some Ruby 1.9 specific exceptions.
The category only applies to the item immediately following the comment.
The cause is no longer used so we need not hold a reference to the string
The certificate will be changed every time the server is restarted.
The certificates must be in PEM format.
The chain is built by recursively calling #chain on the source reflection and the through reflection.
The chain starts with the target table, but we want to end with it here (makes more sense in this context), so we reverse
The change may add new features, but do so in a way that client software written to an earlier version is still compatible.
The change may be an implementation detail only and have no effect on the client software.
The change may change the public interface of the library in such a way that old software is no longer compatible.
The changed state is then set to +false+.
The channel from which to download Chef.
The channel just acts as a connector between the two parties (the broadcaster and the channel subscriber).
The channel provides the basic structure of grouping behavior into logical units when communicating over the WebSocket connection.

The cipher text and initialization vector are base64 encoded and returned to you.
The class has a block comment within, so it's not corrected.
The class has to implement a class method _json_create_ that expects a hash as first parameter.
The class is initialized with a stream and can be used to either write a JSON string or an object which can be converted to JSON.
The class methods proxy to said thread local instance.
The class of value is same as #read method returns.
The class or constant name of the object can be read from the +name+ attribute.
The class provides version or help information if they were requested, and also constructs the railsrc file (used for extra configuration options).
The class returned implements a `run` method that accepts a preloader.
The classic example is a transfer between two accounts where you can only have a deposit if the withdrawal succeeded and vice versa.
The classic example is the use of a header and footer (even though the Action Pack-way would be to use Layouts):
The client SHOULD NOT attempt to match a presented identifier in which the wildcard character comprises a label other than the left-most label (e.g., do not match bar.*.example.net).
The client SHOULD NOT attempt to match a presented identifier where the wildcard character is embedded within an A-label or U-label of an internationalized domain name.

The communicator is guaranteed to be ready at this point, and any shared folders or networks are already setup.
The compact style is only forced for classes/modules with one child.
The compiled code can be used in any context where the names in the code correctly resolve.
The component doesn't contains the port number.
The components accepted are +userinfo+, +host+, +port+, +path+ and +typecode+.
The components accepted are host, port, dn, attributes, scope, filter, and extensions.

The connection is long-lived, so it needs its own set of tags for its independent duration.
The connection pool is "fair" if threads waiting for connections receive them in the order in which they began waiting.
The connection will remain open and active but will no longer be managed by this pool.
The connection will remain open for multiple requests in the block if the server indicates it supports persistent connections.
The connnection should be a Net::HTTP object, and it should have been constructed using the Net::HTTP.Proxy method, but anything that responds to "get" will work.
The constant WidgetsController can be resolved from the name.
The constant is no longer reachable, just skip it.
The constant value and comment will be updated later, when the Ruby parser adds the constant
The constructor accepts a hash as options for parser.
The constructor for the value class is called +create+ and it expects a CIDR address string as a parameter.
The constructor generates set of regexps for parsing URIs.
The content is the declaration itself, unparsed.
The content will be converted to the +encoding+.
The contents are the same, so no corruption of data should occur.
The contents of comments are never modified.
The contents of the file will be shifted to have the same indentation as the ':' at the start of the +:include:+ directive.
The contents of the highest-numbered group matched in the last successful pattern match.
The contents of the nonce are implementation dependent.
The contents of this object vary from event to event, but are identical to the arguments passed to +StreamListener+s for each event.
The context has :+respect_whitespace+ set to :+all+ or an array containing the name of this element, and :+compress_whitespace+ isn't set to :+all+ or an array containing the name of this element.
The context holds information about the processing environment, such as whitespace handling.
The context in which a Resource.stage() occurs.
The controller generator will then try to invoke the following generators:
The controller passes objects to the view by assigning instance variables:
The controller specifies a form builder as its default:
The conversion functions such as NUM2INT uses (conceptually) to_int.
The conversion takes place in the +convert+ method, so you can use the same RDoc::Markup converter to convert multiple input strings.
The conversion will fail if the data cannot be transcoded, leaving the field unchanged.
The conversion will fail if the data cannot be transcoded, leaving the header unchanged.
The cookie is signed by your app's `secrets.secret_key_base` value.
The cookie jar used for storage is automatically configured to be the best possible option given your application's configuration.
The cookies being read are the ones received along with the request, the cookies being written will be sent out with the response.
The cookies of the request that initiated the WebSocket connection.
The cop also reports warnings when you are using 'to_time' method, because it doesn't know about Rails time zone either.
The cop can also be configured to do the reverse.
The cop is configurable and can enforce the use of the older something_filter methods or the newer something_action methods.
The cop only registers an offense if the extra line is completely empty.
The corresponding relative version, 'sqlite3:foo', is handled elsewhere, as an "opaque".
The counter cache is incremented when an object of this class is created and decremented when it's destroyed.
The counter starts at 1 because it's awaiting a call to #subscribe_to_channel
The counter_cache option must be given on either the owner or inverse association, and the column must be present on the owner.
The created digest object is returned.
The created file is not removed automatically.
The created gem can be downloaded and installed.
The created gem is downloaded in to the cache directory but is not installed
The critera for being valid:

The cyclomatic complexity is the number of linearly independent paths through a method.
The data in +class_module+ is preferred over the receiver.
The data is identical to the arguments passed for the various events to the StreamListener API.

The derivation is restricted by an positive integer _limit_ to avoid infinite generation.
The description of the software.
The description should be more detailed than the summary but not excessively long.
The details are changed, so a new cache key is generated.
The difference here being that the routes generated are like /:account_id/projects, rather than /accounts/:account_id/projects.
The difference is mostly where to place the foreign key, which goes on the table for the class declaring the #belongs_to relationship.
The difference is that returns +self+, instead of an array with the deleted objects, so methods can be chained.
The difference to the default template method is that the migration version is appended to the destination file name.
The different methods are available to make the tests more expressive.
The difficulty is to make sure not to match lines starting with ARGF at the same indent, but that are after the first description paragraph.
The digest will be generated using +virtual_path:+ if it is provided.

The expected default behavior is an XMLHttpRequest in the background instead of the regular POST arrangement, but ultimately the behavior is the choice of the JavaScript driver implementor.
The expiration time is used to support the :race_condition_ttl option on the cache.
The expiration time may be a false value to disable expiration or a Time or HTTP format time string to set the expiration date.
The exploded style works identically, but with the addition that it will also suggest constructing error objects when the exception is passed multiple arguments.

The global default options for the JSON.dump method: :max_nesting: false :allow_nan:   true :allow_blank: true
The global default options for the JSON.load method: :max_nesting: false :allow_nan:   true :allow_blank:  true
The goal is for this to work in almost every case, but perhaps with some warnings.
The goal of this class is to be able to insert and remove these blocks without modifying anything else in the string.
The graph is represented by _each_node_ and _each_child_.
The graph is represented by _node_ and _each_child_.
The guest can then be extended with various "guest capabilities" which are their own form of plugin.
The guest class itself is only responsible for detecting itself, and may provide helpers for the capabilties.
The guest implementation knows how to do guest-OS specific tasks, such as configuring networks, mounting folders, etc.
The handler must respond to +:call+, which will be passed the template and should return the rendered template as a String.
The handler on which events will be called
The handler will be called with the result RDoc::Comment (or text String) and the code object for the comment (if any).
The hard limit is 1GB, according to section 8.3 in the manual.
The hard limit is 1GB, because of a 32-bit size field, and TOAST.
The hash form works much like the array form, except only equality and range is possible.
The hash is passed to the supplied Proc or the method and it should return either +true+ or +false+.
The hash may include other options, where keys are symbols:
The hash method is especially useful when you're receiving the data from somewhere else, like an HTTP request.
The hash must have directories as keys and the value is an array of extensions to be watched under that directory.
The hash should contain a :path with the incoming request path and a :method containing the required HTTP verb.
The hash should include the required data.
The hash will automatically be wrapped in a JSON envelope with the proper channel identifier marked as the recipient.
The header to use is set via +config.action_dispatch.x_sendfile_header+.
The header's id would be:
The headers can be generated as a string using the #http_header() method.
The headers will be merged into the Rack env hash.
The headings greater than 6 are trimmed to level 6.
The hidden field has the same name and its attributes mimic an unchecked check box.
The hidden field has the same name as collection radio button and blank value.
The hidden field has the same name as multiple select and blank value.
The hierarchy is defined as follows: Association - SingularAssociation - BelongsToAssociation - HasOneAssociation - CollectionAssociation - HasManyAssociation
The hierarchy of Ruby objects stored under that root _name_ will be returned.
The high level YAML parser provided by Psych simply takes YAML as input and returns a Ruby data structure.
The high level emitter has the easiest interface.
The highest known needed value by a formula at this time (February 2016) was 43,478 for git-annex, so 100,000 should be enough to avoid most gratuitous backjumps build failures.
The highest-valued key should be equal to the CURRENT_SPECIFICATION_VERSION.
The homepage for the software.
The hook is called after the gem has been extracted and extensions have been built but before the executables or gemspec has been written.

The latest version of the TomDoc specification can be found at:
The latter is a flawed and unsustainable approach (the more migrations you'll amass, the slower it'll run and the greater likelihood for issues).
The latter is a shortcut for:
The latter is used to set the parameter as permitted and limit which attributes should be allowed for mass updating.
The latter method iterates through an array doing regular expression matches, which results in a lot of object creations.
The latter two can be directly, and the first indirectly, replaced, in order to provide different behaviour and capabilities.

The metaclass of +klass+ should handle #bla since it should inherit methods from meta:meta:Array
The metadata command for this push.
The metadata holds extra data for this gem that may be useful to other consumers and is settable by gem authors without requiring an update to the rubygems software.
The method #params() returns a hash of all parameters in the request as name/value-list pairs, where the value-list is an Array of one or more values.

The method can also be called with multiple arguments.
The method can be followed by parenthesis (not recommended)
The method can be used in several slightly different ways, depending on how much you wish to rely on Rails to infer automatically from the model how the form should be constructed.
The method enumerates prime numbers infinitely if +ubound+ is nil.
The method for the form defaults to POST.
The method has no block comment inside, but it's within a class that has a block comment, so it's not corrected either.
The method is failed if option processing has already started.
The method is intended to return an ActiveRecord::Relation object, which is composable with other scopes.
The method maintains backward compatibility if the key 'data' is already used in _config.yml.
The method reference callbacks work by specifying a protected or private method available in the object, like this:
The method reference is the preferred approach to variable layouts and is used like this:
The method removes the basename of the file path and the digest, if any.
The method returns true if any element from the ArrayInquirer collection is equal to the stringified or symbolized form of any element in the +candidates+ collection.

The object being replaced will still be saved to update its foreign key.
The object is instantiated first, therefore all callbacks and filters are fired off before the object is deleted.
The object returned is a relation, which can be further extended.
The observable object must: * assert that it has +#changed+ * call +#notify_observers+
The odd method of detecting this is based on this StackOverflow question:
The offense on line 4 is corrected, affecting lines 4 to 11.
The offenses that couldn't be corrected will be found again so we only keep the corrected ones in order to avoid duplicate reporting.
The offset is the number of seconds that this time zone is offset from UTC (GMT).

The only exception in ActiveModel for ActiveRecord is the use of self.build instead of self.new.
The only necessary method to implement is the "perform" method.
The only parameter is the text to ask the user.
The only required parameter is a UI object so that the host objects have some way to communicate with the outside world.
The only requirement is that the +model+ parameter be an object that responds to +all+, and returns an array of objects that represent time zones.
The only restriction is that the word must begin with a capital letter.
The only solution that works with both new and old versions of Rubygems is to provide our own function for JUST resetting all the stubs.
The only time this isn't true is when an Element is created that is not part of any Document.

The options below give you various choices, in more or less increasing complexity.
The options for atom_feed are:
The options given to the provider when registering the plugin.
The options hash is passed to the underlying cache implementation.
The options here should be structured as an array of string "gem" command names as keys and a string of the default options as values.
The options is a hash where the main available key is `cwd`, which defines where the environment represents.
The options on the hash get priority, then the default values
The options to pass to Process.spawn are constructed by merging +opts+, the last hash element of the array, and specifications for the pipes between each of the commands.
The options to support are passed to new() as an array of arrays.
The options used when no overrides are given by calling code.
The options version of redirect allows you to supply only the parts of the url which need to change, it also supports interpolation of the path similar to the first example.
The order clause takes precedence over the informed ids
The order in which jobs are processed can be configured differently depending on the adapter.
The order in which mappings are defined determines the order in which attributes are sent to the value class constructor.
The order in which the substitutions occur
The order in which values are removed/returned is not guaranteed.
The order of elements is uncertain.
The order of the mappings will determine the order of the parameters.
The order will depend on the database implementation.

The owner is passed as a parameter to the block.
The padding character is optional.
The pair is located as described in CSV::Row.field().
The parameter +addr+ is validated using the first +family+ member, which is +Socket::AF_INET+ or +Socket::AF_INET6+.
The parameter given is the full V2 configuration object, so you can do anything to it that you want.
The parameter given should be nil if this is being created publicly.
The parameter is called MinDigits (meaning the minimum number of digits for which an offense can be registered), but essentially it's a Max parameter (the maximum number of something that's allowed).
The parameter name is the name attribute of the file input field, as usual.
The parameters env, cmd, and opts are passed to Process.spawn.
The parameters for start_document must be this:
The parameters in the signature may have reserved Ruby words, in order to prevent errors, we start each param name with `_`.

The pattern must respond to +.match+, else ArgumentError is raised.
The payload is a mechanism that allows instrumenters to pass extra information to subscribers.
The penalty for the rest of strings is marginal.
The permalink for this Document.
The persistent data directory where global data can be stored.
The phrase "Updating salaries..." would then be printed, along with the benchmark for the block when the block completes.
The plugin builder allows you to override elements of the plugin generator without being forced to reverse the operations of the default generator.
The plugin should be registered if we're setting a real name on it
The plugins are allowed to be in a directory in `plugins` or at most one directory deep within the plugins directory.
The point of fixtures are that they're stable units of predictable sample data.
The point of this check is that it's easy to miss the call tacked on to the block when reading code.
The pool consists of one connection that corresponds to `http_args`.
The pool first tries to gain ownership of all connections.

The problem is caused by a bug in Racc that is discussed in issue #93 of the whitequark/parser project on GitHub.
The proc below loads the box and provider overrides.
The procedure +separator_proc+ is called between each yields.
The process ends after this.
The process number of the program being executed.
The process will ensure that the action requested is a public method on the channel declared by the user (so not one of the callbacks like #subscribed).
The progress of the import will be in the last line.
The proper way to communicate between layout and template, regardless of whether you use streaming or not, is by using +content_for+, +provide+ and +yield+.
The protocol for DRb over an SSL socket
The protocol instance returned by #open must have the following methods:
The protocol instance returned by #open_server must have the following methods:

The pseudo-attribute "PRETTY" can be used to specify that the generated HTML string should be indented.
The pseudo-stanza "artifacts" is available.
The public controller methods +respond_to+ may be called with a block that is used to define responses to different mime-types, e.g. for +respond_to+ :
The purpose of using base64 to encode data is that it translates any binary data into purely printable characters.
The quality of the implementation depends on a good choice.
The quantifiers don't need to be a continuous sequence
The quote marks are in the parent node.
The range of this number is 0-65535.
The range of valid choices
The raw IPv4 address as a String.
The raw recipe text (as a string) to execute via chef-apply.
The real benefit of streaming is on expensive actions that, for example, do a lot of queries on the database.
The reason RubyGems refused to install your shiny new signed gem was because it was from an untrusted source.
The reason for doing this is simple -- in `distance_of_time_to_words`, when we take the distance between our two Time objects in seconds and convert it to minutes, we round the number.
The reason for having two modules is that some users aren't interested in complex numbers, and perhaps don't even know what they are.
The reason is that `exec` replaces this process, effectively the same as `kill -9`.
The reason is that the parent model's type is a column value so its corresponding table name cannot be put in the +FROM+/+JOIN+ clauses of that query.
The reason it can't be implemented as a normal cop is that it depends on the results of all other cops to do its work.
The reason we save this to a constant is so we can clean it up later.
The recall key is only used if there is no key in the options or if the key in the options is identical.
The receiver is not contained within the result.
The recommended style is options Hash style for one or more arguments case.
The reconnection time in milliseconds used when attempting to send the event.
The recover should not have been called
The references are forever, so they won't be released as is normally the case with a controller instance that gets thrown away after every request.
The referrer information is pulled from the HTTP `Referer` (sic) header on the request.
The regex marking a line as a comment.
The regexp that matches blank strings is expensive.
The registered preview interceptors will be informed so that they can transform the message as they would if the mail was actually being delivered.

The remaining arguments are used for SMTP authentication, if required or desired.
The remaining logic provides a fake Xcode version for CLT-only systems.
The remaining request parameters, the session (if one is available), and the full request with all the HTTP headers are made available to the action through accessor methods.
The remote_addr used in the last request.
The render call itself will just return a string holding the result of the rendering.
The rendered match is then saved to an accumulator array, and the input string is reduced to the post-match substring.
The replacement should always be a string that may include references to the matched data from the rule.
The request body is an IO input stream.
The request that initiated the WebSocket connection is available here.
The request that the response is responding to.
The request types Net::HTTP supports are listed below in the section "HTTP Request Classes".
The require below is embedded here since it requires windows to work.
The required +precision+ parameter is used to determine the amount of significant digits for the result.
The requirements for implementing ActiveModel::Dirty are:
The resource and all segments will now route to /postings instead of /posts
The resource names should be the import name of the package, e.g. `resource "github.com/foo/bar"`
The response URI is only available if a URI was used to create the request.
The response can be committed multiple times
The response code of the request.
The response is sent to the client after the whole template is rendered, all queries are made, and the layout is processed.
The response that caused this error
The rest are what get actually sent on to the subcommand.
The rest is unchanged.
The rest is used by Rails internally to perform temporary rename operations
The rest of this method is similar to Homebrew's, but translated to local idiom.
The result after rendering is:
The result can be used as an argument for #establish_connection, for easily re-establishing the connection.
The result contains 122 random bits (15.25 random bytes).
The result is only true if the user said "Y"
The result is returned as a new TimeWithZone object.
The result is returned or yielded if a block is given.
The result is that when this method returns, the array will contain elements which match the path
The result is the following:
The result is used to build up a new sequence on the given builder.
The result may also be smaller than string.length (partial write).
The result may contain 0-9 and a-f.
The result may contain alphanumeric characters except 0, O, I and l
The result of calling `write` when this is `false` is determined by `ignore_disconnect`.
The result of this matters on whether we reached our proper target state or not.
The result will be something like:
The result will contain both RDoc::ClassModules and Strings.
The result would be the same if we added +:inverse_of+ to our model definitions:
The result, _mesg_, is the data received.
The resulting exit status of the command will exist in the `:ssh_run_exit_status` key in the environment.
The resulting object is returned whether the object was saved successfully to the database or not.
The resulting string will be stripped in any case.
The results will be returned as an array with columns requested encapsulated as attributes of the model you call this method from.
The retrieved or created session is automatically added to +request+ as a cookie, and also to its +output_hidden+ table, which is used to add hidden input elements to forms.
The return value is 4-elements array.
The return value is a hash of attributes.
The return value is a hash with the following keys (symbols) and values:
The return value is an array of +Net::IMAP::MailboxList+.
The return value is an array of Net::IMAP::FetchData or nil (instead of an empty array) if there is no matching message.
The return value is an array of Net::IMAP::FetchData.
The return value is the relation itself, not the records.
The return value is treated as an opaque object, so it can be anything you'd like.
The return value of Socket.udp_server_sockets is appropriate for the argument.
The return value of the block will be written to the cache under the given cache key, and that return value will be returned.
The return value of the last statement evaluated.
The return value of this method is passed to the next event handler (as of Enumerable#inject).
The return value of this method will be returned from ActiveRecord::AttributeMethods::Read#read_attribute.
The return value of this method will implement the interface described by ActiveModel::Type::Value (though the object itself may not subclass it).
The return value, _numbytes_sent_ is an integer which is the number of bytes sent.
The return values are used as the +value+ attribute and contents of each check box tag, respectively.

The rightmost argument to +form_for+ is an optional hash of options -
The root cause is usually a missing or malfunctioning `git-credential-osxkeychain` helper.
The root destination on the target system to sync the files (default is /).
The root directory where the formula's manual pages should be installed.
The root node reflects the class name of the first element in plural if all elements belong to the same type and that's not Hash:
The root path is the path where the top-most (loaded last) Vagrantfile resides.
The route key also considers if the noun is uncountable and, in such cases, automatically appends _index.
The routing module provides URL rewriting in native Ruby.
The row is simply removed with an SQL +DELETE+ statement on the record's primary key, and no callbacks are executed.
The ruby version can be specified to the patch-level:
The rule can either be a string or a regular expression.
The rules are different than for Ruby, so we cannot use eval.
The rules for duplicated keys follow the semantics of indifferent access:
The rules used to do the guess are handled by the Inflector class in Active Support, which knows almost all common English inflections.
The safe level for this server.
The same as +content_for+ but when used with streaming flushes straight back to the layout.
The same as FileSystemResolver but does not allow templates to store a virtual path since it is invalid for such resolvers.
The same instance variables defined in the action are passed to all email templates.
The same item is described across the +searchIndex+, +longSearchIndex+ and +info+ fields.
The same record may be represented in the persisted array and in the memory array.
The sample usage code given above follows this practice.
The savepoint is now gone and we can't remove it again.
The scalar may have an +anchor+, a +tag+, be implicitly +plain+ or implicitly +quoted+
The scan method is then called to parse the file and must return the RDoc::TopLevel object.

The second parameter is the argument string that is passed to the generator or an Array that is joined.
The second problem is scalability.
The second run (and possibly the first) should hit the cache.
The second value can be a nested array of text-value pairs.
The section below is a step-by-step guide to using signed gems and generating your own.
The section parent must be restored manually.

The session id is a secure random number by SecureRandom if possible, otherwise an SHA512 hash based upon the time, a random number, and a constant string.
The session must have been previously connected.
The session should not be used, however, as a cache for objects where it's likely they could be changed unknowingly.
The set of all prime numbers.
The set of directories from which automatically loaded constants are loaded only once.
The set of directories from which we may automatically load files.
The set of special characters and their escaped values
The set of time zones corresponds to the ones specified by RFC 2822 and ISO 8601.
The shell wrapper command used in shell_execute defined by the sudo and shell options.
The short description should be a single word description of the state of the machine such as "running" or "not created".
The simplest way to do this is via cookies.
The simplest way to send output to the HTTP client is using the #out() method.
The single argument to scanf is a format string, which generally includes one or more conversion specifiers.

The source as a Pathname, which is easier to work with
The source root is the path to the root directory of the Vagrant source.
The spec's filenames will be registered as-is.
The special `:name` parameter in the command will be replaced with the unique ID or name of the virtual machine.

The specification is yielded for customization.
The specification will be yielded before creation for customization, but only the block or the dependencies may be set, not both.
The specification will be yielded before gem creation for customization, but only the block or the dependencies may be set, not both.
The specification will be yielded before gem creation for customization.
The specification's set will be the current set, and the source will be the current set's source.
The specifications in the returned array will be considered in reverse order, so the latest version ought to be last.
The specifics differ between databases.
The specified URL will then be passed a File object containing the selected file, or if the field was left blank, a StringIO object.
The stack backtrace generated by the last exception.
The stack is not cleared afterwords.
The stack is now the result of the new builder
The standard CGI environmental variables are available as read-only attributes of a CGI object.
The standard library supports RSS 0.91, 1.0, 2.0, and Atom, a related format.
The standard set of helper methods for form building are located in the +field_helpers+ class attribute.
The state also stores a state "id" which can be used as a unique identifier for a state.
The state can be any symbol.
The state is queried from the backing provider, so it can be any arbitrary symbol.
The status code is used by the `vagrant` executable as the error code, and the error key is used as a default message from I18n.
The stdlib recorded in the install receipt is used during dependency compatibility checks, so we only care about the stdlib that libraries link against.
The store maintains a #cache of its contents for faster lookup.
The store manages reading and writing ri data for a project and maintains a cache of methods, classes and ancestors in the store.
The stream is the root of the tree.
The stream is valid only in the block, and has these methods:

The tables for these classes could look something like:
The tag name for this sequence (if any)
The tag value (if there is one)
The target can be anything callable within the object.
The target is stale if the target no longer points to the record(s) that the relevant foreign_key(s) refers to.
The target method must be public, otherwise it will raise +NoMethodError+.

The template will be rendered in a Rack environment which is accessible through ActionController::Renderer#env.
The temporary file will be placed in the directory as specified by the +tmpdir+ parameter.
The test adapter should be used only in testing.
The test case uses minitest, so all the assertions of minitest may be used.
The test helpers are responsible for setting up the queue, subscriptions and turning colors in logs off.
The test output is stored in a directory called "mongo-test-output" in the root of your checkout.
The test will fail if it returns false, or if an exception is raised.
The test will have the following name:
The testcase provides the following:
The tested hosts are explained in detail here: https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/commit/5e16a5428f973667cabfa07e94ff939e7a83ebd9
The testing environment will automatically load all the fixtures into the database before each test.
The tests explain the purpose of this better than the code lets on, I believe.
The text +sep+ is inserted if a line is not broken at this point.
The text for parts of this document, especially the Description and Conversions sections, above, were adapted from the Linux Programmer's Manual manpage for scanf(3), dated 1995-11-01.
The text is appended in the +raw+ mode of this text node.
The text may be prefixed by the response code.
The third argument is the actual data, a map represented as an array of two-element arrays.
The third argument, +indent_empty_lines+, is a flag that says whether empty lines should be indented.

The through record (built with build_record) is temporarily cached so that it may be reused if insert_record is subsequently called.
The time is parsed using Time.parse method.
The time to wait before sending a SIGTERM to the container when it is stopped.
The timezone can be either :local or :utc (default :local).
The title and parsed comment are saved, but not the section parent which must be restored manually.
The title following +:section:+ is used as the section name and the remainder of the comment containing the section is used as introductory text.

The transport layer is responsible for opening client and server network connections and forwarding dRuby request across them.
The two are compared first on their offsets, and then by name.
The two main methods for testing your routes:
The two relations must be structurally compatible: they must be scoping the same model, and they must differ only by #where (if no #group has been defined) or #having (if a #group is present).
The two-element version omits either the option value (defaults to the same as the display text) or the boolean selected specifier (defaults to false).
The type detected by Active Record can be overridden.
The type for the numeric depends on the width of the field, so we'll do something special here.

The type of an attribute is given the opportunity to change how dirty tracking is performed.
The type of checksum (if any) associated with this provider.
The type of synced folders to use.
The type of the provisioner that should be registered as a plugin.
The type of this event.
The type used to get this primitive should have been provided before reaching the connection adapter.
The typical filter use case is to remove lengthy path information from the start of each line, and view file paths relevant to the app directory instead of the file system root.
The typical route is to just dump everything in a monolithic class, perhaps with a comment, as a least-bad alternative.
The typical silencer use case is to exclude the output of a noisy library from the backtrace, so that you can focus on the rest.
The underlying IO object.
The underlying body, as a streamable object.
The underlying class variable is set to +nil+, if it is not previously defined.
The underlying implementation is the libyaml wrapper Psych.
The underlying per-thread class variable is set to +nil+, if it is not previously defined.
The uninstaller fires pre and post uninstall hooks.
The unique ID for the forwarded port.
The unique ID for this entry.
The unique ID must be absolutely unique to the virtual machine, and can be used by providers for finding the actual machine associated with this instance.
The unique request id can be used to trace a request end-to-end and would typically end up being part of log files from multiple pieces of the stack.
The unit of time is seconds.
The unusual part of its implementation is that it doesn't have any on_* methods or an investigate method.
The updated template should be picked since lookup_context generated a new key after we changed the locale.
The upgrade process will remove the old data file if it is successful.
The upper bound of enumeration.
The upside of long-lived channel instances is that you can use instance variables to keep reference to objects that future subscriber requests can interact with.
The upwards search is stopped at this level.
The use of both natdnsproxy and natdnshostresolver break on Ubuntu 12.04 and 12.10 that uses resolvconf with localhost.
The use of this method should be restricted to complicated SQL queries that can't be executed using the ActiveRecord::Calculations class methods.
The use of uniq before pluck is preferred because it executes within the database.
The user can also specify the encoding via a comment on the first line of the template (# encoding: NAME-OF-ENCODING).
The user can override this default by passing a block to the layout:
The user can specify the encoding using Ruby-style encoding comments in any template engine.
The user does not generally need to call it directly.
The user does not have to directly deal with this object in normal use.
The user does not normally need to deal with it directly.
The user has defined their own default scope method, so call that

The valid arguments are given in VALID_UNSCOPING_VALUES.
The valid name for a Vagrantfile for this environment.
The validators hash can also handle regular expressions, ranges, arrays and strings in shortcut form.
The value is returned with the same data type of the column, +0+ if there's no row.
The value is returned with the same data type of the column, or +nil+ if there's no row.
The value is the accessor to which the methods will be delegated.
The value is truncated word by word.
The value of :nameserver should be an address string or an array of address strings.
The value of :nameserver_port should be an array of pair of nameserver address and port number.
The value of the array elements should be a simple file glob relative to the directory being packaged.
The value of the block is returned.
The value of this is to be an Array of pairs:
The value returned from calling +method+ on the instance +object+ will be selected.
The value that is appended to +output+ to add a new line.
The value type is REG_SZ(write_s), REG_DWORD(write_i), or REG_BINARY(write_bin).
The values are passed to the connector for quoting, but the caller is responsible for ensuring they are enclosed in quotes in the resulting SQL.
The values are returned in reverse order of their inclusion, which is the order suitable for searching methods/attributes in the ancestors.
The values are unchanged.
The values compared should be of fixed length, such as strings that have already been processed by HMAC.
The variable foo belongs to the top level scope, but in AST, it's under the block node.
The variable is local to the current scope.
The variable is set to the contents of +fields+.

The version of the installed library.
The version of this box.
The version of virtualbox that is running.
The version specifies the version of the configuration that is expected by the block.
The version string can contain numbers and periods, such as +1.0.0+.
The version string is usually in one of the following formats:
The version that this Version object represents.
The very last line of +ActiveRecord::Base+ is:
The view_paths array must be set on Base and not LayoutTest so that LayoutTest's inherited method has access to the view_paths array when looking for a layout to automatically assign.
The virtual machine doesn't exist, so we probably have a stale ID.
The warden therefore allows middlewares to not worry about exceptional events, and by providing a simple callback, can clean up in any erroneous case.
The weakness here was that if it wasn't cleaned up, it would incorrectly not provision new machines.
The weight field specifies a relative weight for entries with the same priority.
The whole `vagrant package --base` process is deprecated for something much better in the future.
The whole block will be called in the right order within the migration.
The whole info structure parsed from the JSON
The width of +obj+ / +sep+
The word will be pluralized using rules defined for the locale (you must define your own inflection rules for languages other than English).
The worker pool is an executor service that's backed by a pool of threads working from a task queue.
The worker pool is where we run connection callbacks and channel actions.
The workflow is to append a PrettyPrint::Text object to the buffer, and being able to call the buffer.last() to reference it.
The working directory should be the root path
The writer adapter class
Their main advantage is that the macros add behavior into a callback queue that is kept intact down through an inheritance hierarchy.
Then arbitrary gemspecs will be returned until the circular dependency is broken, after which gems will be returned in dependency order again.
Then checks the methods, and finally check the underlying hash (e.g. document front matter) if all the previous places didn't match.
Then consistency is checked only within each section delimited by a modifier node.
Then create a server that does not listen by default:
Then define a list of methods that you want callbacks attached to:
Then drop privileges:
Then evaluates the given expressions using the +:XMP+ prompt mode.
Then in the view any form using +form_for+ will be an instance of the specified form builder:
Then in your class, you can use the +before_create+, +after_create+ and +around_create+ methods, just as you would in an Active Record model.
Then overwrite the listening sockets with the port 80 sockets:
Then the action is performed.
Then the cop treats it as an `if`/`elsif`/`elsif`...
Then the holder of issued certificate (in this case, your buddy "drbrain"), can start using this signed certificate to sign RubyGems.
Then the new value is appended to that Array.
Then touch /var/log/my_program.log and signal syslogd with a HUP (killall -HUP syslogd, on FreeBSD).
Then we can skip decode+encode if we're just proxying messages.
Then you can directly open the ActionPack documentation by typing 'rdoc actionp'.
Then you can send messages.
Then you must prepare the parse entry method.
Then your library can be eager loaded by simply calling:
Then, "guest capabilities" register themselves for a specific OS (one or more), and these capabilities are called.
Then, enter the Ruby expression.
Then, if you want webrat to be invoked, just supply:
Then, in another template or layout, this code would render both links in order:
Then, in another template or layout, this code would render only the last link:
Then, in another view, you could to do something like this:
Then, in the action, we extract the company data from the request, find or create the company, and then create the new person with the remaining data.
Then, one asserts whether the current state is as expected.
Then, remove trailing whitespaces (beetween args and 'do')
Then, wait for it to become running
Then, we do a process lock on the inside, which will raise an exception if locked.
Then, we use `cat` to get that file into the Docker container.
There are a couple of problems with self-signed certificates: first of all, self-signed certificates don't offer a whole lot of security.
There are a few caveats with this module.
There are a few differences between this parser and the specification.
There are a few variables in every Irb session that can come in handy:
There are also some additional HTML generation methods mixed in from the CGI::HtmlExtension module.

There are nineteen callbacks in total, which give you immense power to react and prepare for each state in the Active Record life cycle.
There are no statically declared interfaces for remote objects, such as CORBA's IDL.

There is no way to do this automatically since it can be set on a superclass
There is no way to generate time string with arbitrary timezone.
There is normally no need to replace this component, and no direct way is provided to do so.
There is only one provider, just use that.
There is only one version, just use that.
There is strange, dark magic at work in this code.
There may be scopes on Person.comment_tags, Article.comment_tags and/or Comment.tags, but only Comment.tags will be represented in the #chain.
There must be no whitespace before an XML declaration transitive:: Ignored ie_hack:: Ignored
There needs to be a path to upload the script to
There should be an exception raised if the line
There should be no good reason to do this since Matrices are immutable.
There were two trailing blank lines right above this paragraph, that have been removed.
There will be one checkbox for each value.

There's a series of callbacks associated with #destroy.
There's a series of callbacks associated with #save.
There's a short-hand method for each of the type values declared at the top.
There's also +insert_after+ which will insert a middleware after another:
There's also a convenience method for rendering sub templates within the current controller that depends on a single object (we call this kind of sub templates for partials).
There's also a related idiom that uses the splat operator:
There's an auto-redirect here, but this mistake is incredibly common too.
There's an implicit variable reference by the zero-arity `super`:
There's enough special stuff around it that it may justify a separate class.
There's no existing data for CSV to use to prepare itself and thus you will probably need to manually specify the desired Encoding for most of those cases.
There's no limit to the depth of the nesting.
Therefore disable this feature if host uses the resolvconf server 127.0.0.1 or 127.0.1.1
Therefore test_invalid column should always return true even if the type is not valid.
Therefore the primary key must be orderable, e.g an integer or a string.
Therefore the sti column value will still be the same.
Therefore, if a subclass overrides `initialize`, then you must call `super`.
Therefore, in XML, "local-name()" is identical (and actually becomes) "local_name()"
Therefore, it won't work with instances of classes that do not have +Object+ among their ancestors, like direct subclasses of +BasicObject+.
Therefore, once a value is added to the enum array, its position in the array must be maintained, and new values should only be added to the end of the array.
Therefore, one should always call #unlink or close in an ensure block, like this:
Therefore, prior to communicating with the machine, users of this method are expected to check the guest OS to determine their behavior.
Therefore, we have to offset the bounds by one.
Therefore, we need to parse and re-dump the raw value here to ensure the insignificant whitespaces are consistent with our encoder's output.
Therefore, you are _not_ expected to instantiate this yourself.
Therefore, you need to pass a block that returns the data to be written to the cache.
Therefore, you should test your change against a list of representative scenarios.

They are left here for the time being to allow ri to operate.
They are made up of one or more actions that are executed on request and then either it renders a template or redirects to another action.
They are mostly standard base colors supported by pretty much any xterm-color, we do not need more than the base colors so we do not include them.
They are mostly used for migrating non-`with` options (e.g. `enable-debug`) to `with` options (e.g. `with-debug`).

They will however still be marked for destruction.
They will receive the corrector itself and should use its method to modify the source.
They would rather have Math.sqrt(-1) raise an exception than return a complex number.
They're a tad confusing, so here is how the dependency specifiers work:
They're expected to modify themselves in our case.
They're useless and will never be added, so don't bother.
Things that aren't tested elsewhere
Things that have markup suppressed
Think of creating routes as drawing a map for your requests.
Third configurable block to run.
This  allows  one  to  provide  a  wrapper  around a function in another shared library.
This "abstract" step must create the inventory file and return its location path TODO: explain possible race conditions, etc.

This Vagrantfile contains the MAC address so that the user doesn't have to worry about it.
This Vagrantfile is comprised of two major sources: the Vagrantfile in the user's home directory as well as the "root" Vagrantfile or the Vagrantfile in the working directory (or parent).
This above is achieved by:
This abstraction is done becauase there is some host-specific logic that Vagrant must do in some cases.
This abstracts the setup and rendering into a separate classes for partials and templates.
This acquires a lock on the host VM.
This acquires a process-level lock with the given name.
This action boots the VM, assuming the VM is in a state that requires a bootup (i.e. not saved).

This action just runs the provisioners on the machine.
This action packages the virtual machine into a single box file.
This action reads the SSH info for the machine and puts it into the `:machine_ssh_info` key in the environment.
This action should be placed BEFORE the machine is booted so it can do some setup, and then run again (on the return path) against a running machine.
This action starts a VM, assuming it is already imported and exists.
This action starts another container just like the real one running but only for the purpose of running a single command rather than to exist long-running.
This action takes the `:plugin_name` variable in the environment and installs it using the RubyGems API.
This action will run the cleanup methods on provisioners and should be used as part of any Destroy action.
This actions checks if a box is outdated in a given Vagrant environment for a single machine.

This allows classes consulting the documentation tree to access user-set options, for example.
This allows configuration classes to still hold around internal state that isn't propagated.
This allows control over how values are converted to and from SQL when assigned to a model.
This allows developers to implement #as_json without having to worry about what base types of objects they are allowed to return or having to remember to call #as_json recursively.
This allows for easier maintenance and testing of Markdown support.
This allows for hash options to be overridden by a scope key prefix.
This allows for the detection of queries that return a large number of records, which could cause memory bloat.
This allows for views to display rather reasonable strings while still giving developers a way to find missing translations.
This allows generators to add custom options or set default options.
This allows internal code to compare state such as ":not_created" instead of using string comparison.

This also applies to MySQL apps but not with SQLite
This also may not match up with configured forwarded ports, because Vagrant auto port collision fixing may have taken place.
This also means that this method only works when the primary key is orderable (e.g. an integer or string).
This also works for the methods in FormOptionHelper and DateHelper that are designed to work with an object as base, like FormOptionHelper#collection_select and DateHelper#datetime_select.
This also works with polymorphic belongs_to relationships:
This ambiguity cannot be resolved at this stage anymore.
This and #instrument_name is for caching instrument
This applies the given hook to a builder.
This approach was introduced in Rails 3.1 and is still improving.
This approach will assume that when a new topic is added, you'll touch the project.
This argument is a noop.
This argument is nil only because the old style was deprecated and we didn't want to break Vagrantfiles.
This argument is only useful if +raw+ is set to false.
This array can be used as such:
This array contains name of all ripper events.
This array contains name of parser events.
This array contains name of scanner events.
This array is processed recursively.
This array is used to preserve the order in which VMs are defined.
This array needs not be flat, i.e. +records+ itself may also contain arrays of records.
This asks the provider via the `winrm_info` capability if it exists, otherwise defaulting to its own heuristics.
This assertion is for porting x2() tests in testpy.py of Onigmo.
This assertion should preferably be the last in the list, because calling other_topic_klass.table_name sets a class-level instance variable
This asserts that if a gem's dependency is satisfied by an already installed gem, RubyGems doesn't installed a newer version
This associates two classes via an intermediate join table.

This base method does nothing (it doesn't even store the machine in an instance variable for you), so you're expected to override this and do something with the machine if you care about it.
This behaves in almost the same way as outlined previously, with a couple of small exceptions.
This behavior is due to ruby's constant lookup behavior.
This behavior is inherited from RDoc version 1, and has been kept for compatibility with existing RDoc documentation.
This behavior is preserved under inheritance and cloning.
This behavior only exists because Homebrew used to assume Xcode.version would always be non-nil.
This block is yielded with the job instance as the first and the error instance as the second parameter.
This bracketed sub-expression is interpreted exactly like a character class in a Ruby regular expression.
This budget much simpler: with no :around callbacks invoked, there should be just one line.
This builder is then run.
This builds an array of objects from the database for the scope, converting them into an array and iterating through them using Array#select.
This builds upon the top-level PStore class provided by the library file pstore.rb.
This built-in middleware handles the `box` setting by verifying the box is already installed, dowloading the box if it isn't, updating the box if it is requested, etc.
This buys us proper argument quoting and evaluation of environment variables in the cmd parameter.
This bypasses the asset pipeline and all other behavior described.
This cache does implement the local cache strategy, so values will actually be cached inside blocks that utilize this strategy.
This cache has a bounded size specified by the :size options to the initializer (default is 32Mb).
This cache is not thread safe and is intended only for serving as a temporary memory cache for a single thread.
This caching avoids the issue where a file may have side effects when loading and loading it multiple times causes unexpected behavior.

This can be done by overwriting this method.
This can be done by using '-E' option:
This can be done either by specifying a method reference as a symbol or using an inline method (as a proc).

This can potentially speed things up considerably since we don't need to unpack any files.
This can raise DRb::DRbBadScheme or DRb::DRbBadURI if +uri+ is not for a recognized protocol.
This can raise IO exceptions based on the access, or availability of the file.
This case is fine because our lazy loading is provided exactly the same behavior as eager loading would have.
This catches an error message that only shows when kernel drivers aren't properly installed.
This catches the case when the container was supposed to be created, but the host state was unknown, and now we know its not actually created.
This catches the generic VBoxManage error case.
This causes some false positives for the comparison here.
This check is not cryptographically secure.
This check is performed only if +terms_of_service+ is not +nil+ and by default on save.

This won't be the right warning if we matched nothing at all
This work flow assumes that you are a translator for Japanese.
This work flow uses gettext gem because it is more portable than GNU gettext for Rubyists.
This works by using a type column in addition to a foreign key to specify the associated record.

This works, but it would be better if we formatted the output ourselves.
This would allow a user to use new nonce without prompting the user again for their username and password.
This would be same as `target_files` passed to `#started` unless RuboCop is interrupted by user.
This would cause a warning to be printed on stderr if the file was read.
This would mean that any threads stuck waiting in the queue wouldn't know they could checkout_new_connection, so let's do it for them.
This would render "advertiser/_account.html.erb".
This write will block, and eventually raise
This writes out the entire XML document, including XML declarations, doctype declarations, and processing instructions (if any are given).
This yields an environment hash to change and catches any issues while changing the environment variables and raises a helpful error to end users.
This, and not #process, is the intended way to override action dispatching.
This, the default implementation, uses an object's local ObjectSpace __id__ as its id.
Thor's not so indifferent access hash.
Those points are going to be addressed soon.
Those will not be the ultimate client IP in production, and so are discarded.
Though the #transaction class method is called on some Active Record class, the objects within the transaction block need not all be instances of that class.
Threadsafe template cache
Threadsafe, fair, FIFO queue.
Three modes are supported through the `AlignWith` configuration parameter:
Three or more dashes are considered to be a rule and ignored.
Through RubyGemTestCase you can install and uninstall gems, fetch remote gems through a stub fetcher and be assured your normal set of gems is not affected.
Through association (uses the :primary_key option from the source reflection)
Through associations can either use the has_many or has_one macros.
Through the use of eager loading, the number of queries will be reduced from 101 to 2.
Thrown exceptions are propagated back to the parent process over a pipe
Thus CSV will return Arrays or Rows of Strings in the Encoding of your data.
Thus it is possible to reliably identify an attribute even if an XML processor has changed the prefix.
Thus the string is "eaten" from the left as the FormatSpecifiers are applied in sequence.
Thus this test prepares waiting threads and then trickles in available connections slowly, ensuring the wakeup order is correct in this case.
Thus, given +words+ is "car" and "cone", the keys pointing to "car" would be "ca" and "car", while those pointing to "cone" would be "co", "con", and "cone".
Thus, if the function is called from the main program, all the shared libraries are searched.
Thus, there is no ways to access the OptionParser object via the receiver object.
Thus, warnings MUST NOT be suppressed.
Thus, we lazy load it and disable warnings locally.
Thus, you won't be able to verify the results of your transaction until Active Record supports nested transactions or savepoints (in progress).
Tiger doesn't ship expat in /usr/lib
Tiger doesn't ship with apple-gcc42, and this is required to build some software that doesn't build properly with FSF GCC.

Time at which this cookie expires, as a +Time+
Time comparisons are performed with #compare_without_coercion because AS redefines these operators in a way that is much slower and does not bring any benefit in this particular code.
Time to give our monkey some fruit.
Time#- can also be used to determine the number of seconds between two Time instances.
Time.at can be called with a time or numerical value
Time.new can be called with a time zone offset When it is, that should be considered safe Example: Time.new(1988, 3, 15, 3, 0, 0, "-05:00")
Time.rfc2822(date) rescue Time.parse(date) Time.httpdate(date) rescue Time.parse(date) Time.xmlschema(date) rescue Time.parse(date)
Time.zone will not affect #in_time_zone(zone)
TimeWithZone instances implement the same API as Ruby Time instances, so that Time and TimeWithZone instances are interchangeable.
Timeout handlers should be managed by using the class methods which are synchronized.
Timeout long-running blocks
Timeout provides a way to auto-terminate a potentially long-running operation if it hasn't finished in a fixed amount of time.
TimeoutHandler is since 1.9

To be yielded each record one by one, use #find_each instead.
To call out to the system, we use the `system` method and we prefer you give the args separately as in the line below, otherwise a subshell has to be opened first.
To cause a validation error, you must add to the +record+'s errors directly from within the validators message.
To change this, we can give a block to customize how the controller can be invoked.

To implement the corresponding hosts you can either setup four actual hosts or use wildcard DNS to CNAME the wildcard to a single asset host.
To implement, just extend ActiveModel::Naming in your object:
To implement, you need to wrap the methods you want callbacks on in a block so that the callbacks get a chance to fire:
To include a deep hierarchy of associations, use a hash:
To include the `:build` type dependencies, pass :    `--include-build`.

To make it work across all web requests, the recommended approach is to add +lock_version+ as a hidden field to your form.
To make things DRY this macro is created to define 3 tests for every validation case.
To make use of the for..in code, we use a dummy variable, like one would in C
To make words wrapped with "*" bold:
To match a specific address use any address or address mask that IPAddr can understand.
To match a wildcard parameter, it must have a name assigned to it.
To mitigate this problem, we use a few strategies: 1.
To modify content the proxy server returns use the +:ProxyContentHandler+ option:
To modify the default options pass in the optional _options_ argument as well.
To parse a JSON string received by another application or generated within your existing application:
To pick up a metaprogrammed method, the parser looks for a comment starting with '##' before an identifier:
To play nicely with JavaScript conventions, sub-attributes are dasherized.
To preserve the case of the characters in a string, use the `preserve_case` argument.
To pretty-print JSON refer to JSON#pretty_generate.
To prevent that block from being called anymore, just unsubscribe passing that reference:
To prevent this the helper generates an auxiliary hidden field before every collection of radio buttons.
To prevent this the helper generates an auxiliary hidden field before every multiple select.
To prevent this the helper generates an auxiliary hidden field before the very check box.
To prevent this, only XmlHttpRequest (known as XHR or Ajax) requests are allowed to make GET requests for JavaScript responses.
To prevent users from using something insecure like "Password" we make sure that the secret they've provided is at least 30 characters in length.
To process emphasis tags:
To quickly fill this value you can leave it blank and run `brew fetch --force` and it'll tell you the currently valid value.
To raise an error, it is nothing special, just raise it like any normal exception:
To raise an exception when the value is blank, append a bang to the key name, like:
To read more about JSON visit: http://json.org
To recover, we just do our own recovery process on our stack.
To recreate the instance, pass a non-false value as the parameter.
To remove a csv renderer:
To remove unused values, the explicit hash syntax should be used.

To rotate logs in WEBrick on a HUP signal (like syslogd can send), open the log file in 'a+' mode (as above) and trap 'HUP' to reopen the log file:
To run the server you will need to provide a suitable shutdown hook as starting the server blocks the current thread:
To see how to use RDoc markup to format text in your program read RDoc::Markup.
To see what markup the Parser implements read RDoc.
To set the default allowed tags or attributes across your application:
To setup your validator override the constructor.
To setup, you need just to configure the destination and set which generator is being tested:
To simulate +GET+, +POST+, +PATCH+, +PUT+, +DELETE+ and +HEAD+ requests prefer using #get, #post, #patch, #put, #delete and #head methods respectively which will make tests more expressive.
To skip `:recommended` type dependencies, pass `--skip-recommended`.
To skip white space first, use an explicit space in the format.
To solve this, a 3 second heartbeat runs on all connections.
To specialize the default behavior (i.e., show a login link rather than just the plaintext link text), you can pass a block that accepts the name or the full argument list for +link_to_unless+.
To specialize the default behavior, you can pass a block that accepts the name or the full argument list for +link_to_unless+ (see the examples in +link_to_unless+).
To specify a queue adapter to use:
To start a WEBrick server as a daemon simple run WEBrick::Daemon.start before starting the server.
To start using this library, simply require cmath library:
To start, here's an Htpasswd database for use with a DigestAuth authenticator:
To support these, we must use a subquery.
To switch features on/off: `"with-something"` or `"with-otherthing"`.
To take advantage of these options, install the +actionview-encoded_mail_to+ gem.
To test query strings you must use the extras argument, appending the query string on the path directly will not work.
To test this we need to send data through the socket.
To the user all it matters is that a helper module couldn't be loaded, autoloading is an internal mechanism that should not leak.
To turn off HSTS, omitting the header is not enough.
To unregister a MIME type:
To upgrade, run `bundle update github-pages`.

To use the Inline set the queue_adapter config to +:inline+.
To use the csv renderer in a controller action:
To use the test adapter set queue_adapter config to +:test+.
To use them type as follows in an +irb+ session:
To use this adapter, set queue adapter to +:async+:
To use this class to generate RDoc output via the API, the recommended way is:
To use this, get UnicodeData.txt, Scripts.txt, PropList.txt, PropertyAliases.txt, PropertyValueAliases.txt, DerivedCoreProperties.txt, DerivedAge.txt and Blocks.txt  from unicode.org.
To use, pass an attribute name (as string or symbol).
To use, pass attribute names (as strings or symbols).
To work around this, you must specify the pluralized form as an acronym as well:
To work on the messages within a mailbox, the client must first select that mailbox, using either #select() or (for read-only access) #examine().
To work with both the Bundler Gemfile and Isolate formats this implementation takes some liberties to allow compatibility with each, most notably in #source.

Using a case statement you can handle various types of responses properly:
Using a constant means that we do not have to allocate an object on each call to the attribute method.
Using an extra variable is the only way to ensure that the Ansible remote user is overridden (as the ansible inventory is not under vagrant control)
Using either of these alternate methods incurs a performance hit, as the fixtured data must be fully traversed in the database to create the fixture hash and/or instance variables.
Using explicit id in insert for compatibility across all databases
Using it, you can change the label and check box display order or even use the label as wrapper, as in the example above.
Using it, you can change the label and radio button display order or even use the label as wrapper, as in the example above.
Using modules in separate files means tedious sifting to get a big-picture view.
Using pluralization (Ten/Tens and Tenth/Tenths)
Using polymorphic associations in combination with single table inheritance (STI) is a little tricky.
Using self.x to distinguish from local variable x
Using sub templates allows you to sidestep tedious replication and extract common display structures in shared templates.
Using the first composite notifier object you create, sibling notifiers can be initialized with def_notifier.
Using the multiline modifier will raise an +ArgumentError+.
Using the route above, the URL "http://localhost:3000/articles/2005/11/06" maps to
Using this method means you won't directly depend on the ActiveSupport's JSON implementation, in case it changes in the future.
Using this on non-JSON values will open up serious XSS vulnerabilities.
Usually a database-dependent operation.
Usually contain subcommands.
Usually key value pairs are handled something like this:
Usually the place to setup any streams you want this channel to be sending to the subscriber.
Usually there will be carriage return characters on all or none of the lines in a file, so we report only one offense.
Usually this is called by super from a subclass.
Usually this means that the iconv library is not installed.
Usually this model is not saved to the database.
Usually, it's synced with a remote git repository.
Usually, one doesn't call this method directly, as new Job objects are created by the #bmbm method.
Usually, one doesn't call this method directly, as new Report objects are created by the #benchmark and #bm methods.

Vagrant UIs handle communication with the outside world (typically through a shell).
Vagrant by default will make "smart" decisions to enable/disable the NAT DNS proxy.
Vagrant determines this automatically based on the environment it is running in.
Vagrant has many tasks which require specific guest OS knowledge.
Vagrant marks ownership of a block in the string by wrapping it in VAGRANT-BEGIN and VAGRANT-END comments with a unique ID.
Vagrant only introduces new configuration versions for major versions of Vagrant.
Vagrant supports configuration versioning so that backwards compatibility can be maintained for past Vagrantfiles while newer configurations are added.
Vagrant uses Bundler as a way to properly resolve all dependencies of Vagrant and all Vagrant-installed plugins.
Vagrant will automatically register V1 plugins when a name is set on the plugin.
Vagrant will automatically register V2 plugins when a name is set on the plugin.

WEBrick also includes tools for daemonizing a process and starting a process at a higher privilege level and dropping permissions.
WEBrick can act as a proxy server:
WEBrick can be run as a production server for small loads.
WEBrick can be started as one user to gain permission to bind to port 80 or 443 for serving HTTP or HTTPS traffic then can drop these permissions for regular operation.
WEBrick can separately log server operations and end-user access.
WEBrick features complete logging of both server operations and HTTP access.
WEBrick includes servlets for handling CGI scripts, ERB pages, Ruby blocks and directory listings.
WEBrick is an HTTP server toolkit that can be configured as an HTTPS server, a proxy server, and a virtual-host server.
WEBrick provides both Basic and Digest authentication for regular and proxy servers.
WEBrick supports both basic and digest authentication in addition to algorithms not in RFC 2617.
WEBrick::AccessLog provides a subset of the formatting from Apache's mod_log_config http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_log_config.html#formats.
WEBrick::Config::HTTP is the default configuration.
WEBrick::HTTPAuth::BasicAuth or WEBrick::HTTPAuth::DigestAuth are built-in.

Warden will "just work" behind the scenes, and is not of particular interest except to those who are curious about the internal workings of Vagrant.
Warn if nothing was replaced
Warn if we're port forwarding to any privileged ports...
Warning log level which indicates a possible problem
Warning: this method modifies the +list+ parameter.
Warnings are issued when dependencies are open-ended or overly strict for semantic versioning.
Warns the user if permanent links are relative to the parent directory.
We _can not_ `super` here because that can really mess up some other configuration state.
We abuse Homebrew's download strategies considerably here.
We accept blank origin headers because some user agents don't send it.
We add 2 because there's one char of padding at both sides, note the extra hyphens in the example above.
We allow multiple spaces here for compatibility with older WEBrick versions.
We allow non-Homebrew installs whenever possible.
We allow separate start and end tags for flexibility
We allow uses of `self` with operators because it would be awkward otherwise.
We already attempted to install f as part of the dependency tree of another formula.
We already attempted to upgrade f as part of the dependency tree of another formula.
We already have a static IP.
We already have one so the existing record will be returned.
We already have the folder, so just load its data
We also don't raise the error if we've forked, because it'll hang the process.
We also force consistent timestamps.
We also need to ensure that associations are readonly where relevant.
We also need to reset the runtime before each action because of queries in middleware or in cases we are streaming and it won't be cleaned up by the method below.
We also set some fields that are purely controlled by Varant
We also want to avoid double reporting of offenses checked by the MultilineBlockChain cop.
We always want to persist the locking version, even if we don't detect a change from the default, since the database might have no default
We append "Vagrantfile" and "vagrantfile" so that those continue to work as well, but anything custom will take precedence.
We are able to call the methods like this:
We are also defining a constant to hold the frozen string of the attribute name.
We are cloning from the box
We are fine if the executable does not error out, so we know linking and building the software was ok.
We are going to assign to existing constants on purpose, so silence warnings.
We are not using DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS because that syntax is only supported by pg 9.X
We are only testing that there are no errors because it's too hard to test serializable.
We are running without transactional tests and need to cleanup.
We are specifying a specific set of arguments (CODES and CODE_ALIASES - notice the latter is a Hash), and the user may provide the shortest unambiguous text.
We are testing that a dirty read does not happen
We are testing that a nonrepeatable read does not happen
We assume every command is idempotent and pass along the `retryable` flag.
We assume that the `up` plugin exists and that we'll have access to this.
We assume that the name of the module reflects the nesting (unless it can be proven that is not the case) and the path to the file that defines the constant.
We assume these things about the IP headers:
We basically never want a connection to go stale, as you then can't rely on being able to communicate with the connection.
We basically take the whole thing as one big comment.
We build up this mapping within the following hash.
We cache the read VirtualBox version here once we have one, since during the execution of Vagrant, it likely doesn't change.
We call it semantic alignment when a dot is aligned with the first dot in a chain of calls, and that first dot does not begin its line.
We can accept URIs and strings that begin with http://, https:// and ftp://.
We can also add our own coercions, which we will cover soon.
We can also pass in the symbol arguments instead of strings.
We can also use our own object.
We can change the date used to infer our missing elements by passing a second object that responds to #mon, #day and #year, such as Date, Time or DateTime.
We can improve and keep unit tests passing in the future.
We can improve upon the situation further by referencing both associations in the finder with:
We can not delete the `default' value.
We can only SSH into a running machine
We can only do the things below if we do not fork, otherwise it'll hang the process.
We can only do this if we successfully installed the gem in the first place.
We can then convert the tree to YAML:
We can then redefine how certain data types may be handled in the schema dumper on the Adapter level by over-writing this code inside the database specific adapters
We can use session-oriented authentication for these types of requests, by using the `protect_from_forgery` method in our controllers.
We can use the lookup method like so:
We can use the same cached proxy object because the id is available for the scope
We can use this option with #fetch too:
We can't ask questions when the output isn't a TTY.
We can't be on Windows, because NFS gets disabled on Windows
We can't be ready if we can't talk to the host VM
We can't cache Post.find_by(author: david) ...yet
We can't cache results from code which is piped in to stdin
We can't get the progress until we see an "OK"
We can't include both ndbm.h and gdbm.h because they both define datum type.
We can't reuse the connection, but we can copy the specification and establish a new connection with it.
We can't silence plain ruby Logger cause with thread safety but at least we don't break it
We can't simply check the first line of the backtrace, because JRuby reports the call to __send__ in the backtrace.
We can't solve the general case, but we can handle most occurrences by ignoring a do at the end of a line.
We can't transcode to the same format, so we choose a nearly-identical encoding.
We can't use alias_method here, because method 'id' optimizes itself on the fly.
We can't use the instance variable inside the lambda.
We cannot use the name "HTTPServerError", it is the name of the response.
We care if the block start with arguments and the expression start on the same line.
We care only for the last argument.
We catch a `TransientError` which would signal that something went that might work if we wait and retry.
We catch a `VagrantError` which would signal that something went wrong expectedly in the `connect`, which means we didn't connect.
We cheat here and dump everything into the same bucket.
We check that optimization here.
We check that the latest image that has been built with that name (:image)  matches the one that the container is running.
We check the parent rather than the very const argument because we do not want to trigger Kernel#autoloads, see the comment below.
We check the plugin names first because those are cheaper to check
We compare both so we know whether it is a new machine.
We configure #execute rather than #execute_if_updated because if autoloaded constants are cleared we need to reload routes also in case any was used there, as in
We contain the common stuff for contexts (which are containers) and other elements (methods, attributes and so on)
We corrected some errors.
We could create it, but the recommended approach on CoreOS is to use Fleet to manage /etc/hosts files.
We could document them using
We create a separate action to hold this though in case we modify it in the future, and so that we can switch on the "machine_action" env var.
We currently support NilClass, Integer, Fixnum, Float, String, TrueClass, FalseClass, Bignum, BigDecimal, and objects that can be represented as GlobalIDs (ex: Active Record).
We currently use Bareiss' multistep integer-preserving gaussian elimination (see comments on determinant)
We detect a V1 box given by whether there is a "box.ovf" which is a heuristic but is pretty accurate.
We detected that we should activate b-2, so we did so, but then original_require decided "I've already got benchmark.rb" loaded.
We directly write to stderr here because the VagrantError system is not setup yet.
We disable the auth methods that we're not using if we don't have the right auth info.
We do a logical OR here because `gets` can return a nil, for example in the case that ctrl-D is pressed on the input.
We do a process-level mutex on the outside, since we can wait for that a short amount of time.
We do adapters 2 to 8 because that is every built-in adapter excluding the NAT adapter on port 1 which Vagrant always expects to exist.
We do as little as possible on the server's main thread.
We do this before anything else so that we can setup the output before any logging occurs.
We do this by creating a V2 configuration, and calling "upgrade" on each of the V1 configurations, expecting them to set the right settings on the new root.
We do this by putting the synced folder on ourself and letting HostMachineSyncFolders handle it.
We do this instead of moving the entire directory to avoid issues on Windows.
We do this once so that they can store state.
We do this so that if later on YAML, etc are redefined, we've still got a consistent place to find the DefaultKey class for comparison.
We do this with a class-wide lock because NFS exporting often requires sudo privilege and we don't want overlapping input requests.
We document the request and response methods here because albeit they are implemented in ActionController::Metal, the type of the returned objects is unknown at that level.
We don't autoload components because if we're loading anything in the V2 namespace anyways, then we're going to need the Components class.
We don't care, because when we set Gem.configuration to nil later, it'll force a reload if it is needed.
We don't copy entire directories, so create the directory and then add to our list to copy.
We don't have a Vagrantfile path set, so we're going to use the default but we need to copy it into the data dir so that we don't write into our installation dir (we can't).
We don't invoke #declare_variable here otherwise Variable#declaration_node will be :lvar node, that is actually not.
We don't know if the first semicolon on the line is a separator of expressions.
We don't know which came from the proxy, and which from the user
We don't need strict fairness: if two connections become available at the same time, it's fine if two threads that were waiting acquire the connections out of order.
We don't need to do anything if the data is empty
We don't own this job so we will update the locked_by name and the locked_at
We don't parallelize this step because it is likely the same provider anyways.
We don't prefix things and we don't output a newline.
We don't really handle any of these since we're not a validating parser, so we can be pretty dumb about them.
We don't show repeated messages unless they've been repeating longer than 10 seconds.
We don't use an optionparser above because I don't think the performance hits of creating a whole object are worth checking only a couple flags.
We don't use the Docker type explicitly on the host VM
We don't want any non-native JSON elements in the job hash, like symbols.
We don't want that to happen, so we disable transactional tests here.
We emulate Unix on the former but not the latter.
We expect one of EOFError or Errno::ECONNRESET in normal operation (when the client goes away).
We expect the bin stub to activate the version that actually contains the binstub.
We expect to find (basename).gem in the 'cache' directory.
We found +path+ directly in an unresolved gem.
We found an active machine with a provider that doesn't match the requested provider.
We found an active machine with the same name
We found the beginning of the sub command.
We get a new VM from the environment here to avoid potentially stale VMs (if there was a config reload on the environment or something).
We get back an object that has all of the data from our feed, accessible through methods.
We go back to the connection for the column queries because Topic.columns is cached and won't report changes to the DB
We got VERR_ALREADY_EXISTS.
We gotta get rid of it if it's there, before we do anything else.
We guard this so that the Warden only outputs this once for an exception that bubbles up.
We had an error, print the stack trace and exit immediately.
We hardcode fixing the permissions on /var/cfengine/ppkeys/, if it exists, because otherwise CFEngine will fail to bootstrap.
We have a port so break out
We have a sorted Array of codepoints that we wish to partition into ranges such that the start- and endpoints form an inclusive set of codepoints with property _property_.
We have an invalid DHCP server that we're not able to automatically clean up, so we need to give up and tell the user to sort out their own vbox dhcpservers and hostonlyifs
We have both a normal URL and "authenticated" URL.
We have more than one provider, ask the user what they want
We have no active machines if we have no data path
We have no direct reference to the colon source range following an optional keyword argument's name, so must construct one.
We have some error data.
We have some records loaded from the database (persisted) and some that are in-memory (memory).
We have static IPs, also attempt to read any dynamic IPs.
We have to add the `silence` method to it because Bundler UI doesn't have it.
We have to check if the UID matches to avoid issues with VirtualBox.
We have to create a Vagrantfile so there is a Vagrant Environment to provide: - a location for the generated inventory - multi-machines configuration
We have to create a Vagrantfile so there is a root path
We have to do all sorts of things to make the proper things symbols and
We have to do this because boot2docker outputs a login shell boot2docker version that we get otherwise and messes up output.
We have to do this because inside the Class.new, it can't see these rspec methods...
We have to do this because we now generate random keypairs on boot, so packaged boxes would stop working without this.
We have to do this before attempting to write to stdin otherwise we'll get a broken pipe error.
We have to do this load here because this file can be loaded before RubyGems is actually loaded.
We have to do this since `readpartial` will actually block until data is available, which can cause blocking forever in some cases.
We have to do this up here so that the pwd returns the proper thing.
We have to execute this in a thread due to trap contexts and locks.
We have to load these up front because otherwise we'll try to load them while we're testing rubygems, and thus we can't actually load them.
We have to normalize the paths to be Windows paths since we're executing PowerShell.
We have to reprocess the source to pickup the changes.
We have to require the generated helper to show the problem because the test helpers just check for generated files and contents but do not actually load them.
We have to splat here because latest_specs is an array, while the others are hashes.
We have to use this `id` command instead of `/usr/bin/id` since this one accepts the "-u" and "-g" flags.
We ignore any extra parameters in the request_uri if the submitted url doesn't have any either.
We ignore the "v1" param for now since I'm not yet sure if its important for the user to know what boxes need to be upgraded and which don't, since we plan on doing that transparently.
We implement the recover method ourselves in case a Warden is embedded within another Warden.
We increment the last codepoint seen and compare it with the current codepoint.
We indicate the position after the left brace.
We invoke the rules indirectly via apply instead of by just calling them as methods because if the rules use left recursion, apply needs to manage that.
We just add "i18n" because it is a dependency of Vagrant and we know it will be there.
We just call the "up" action.
We just hardcode this to keep VirtualBox working for now.
We just keep `level` as `nil`.
We just retry this a few times.
We just take the old value, but dup it so that we can modify.
We keep this instance on hand so we can delegate exception handling to it.
We know that this directory doesn't have a .document file, so we're looking for real files.
We lazily-load this because it is only available on Windows
We lazy-load rubocop so that the task doesn't dramatically impact the load time of your Rakefile.
We let AutocorrectUnlessChangingAST#autocorrect work with the send node, because that context is needed.
We link to our original container TODO
We lock so that we don't snapshot in parallel
We loop over the API call in case we didn't allocate enough buffer space.
We make sure to lock Vagrant to our current Vagrant version.
We may want to disable CSRF protection for APIs since they are typically designed to be state-less.
We merge in these scopes for two reasons:
We might be able to change the implementation to remove conflicts by index, rather than column name
We must avoid making file names too long for some filesystems to handle If they are short, we can leave them human-readable
We must have met our goals because FasterCSV was renamed to CSV and replaced the original library as of Ruby 1.9.
We must make sure that the reflection's active_record name matches up with the current reflection's klass name.
We must not change indentation of heredoc strings.
We must use a File object to simulate the behavior of STDIN, which is an IO object.
We need a Pathname because we've monkeypatched extname to support double extensions (e.g. tar.gz).
We need these components always so instead of an autoload we just require them explicitly here.
We need this in here for the transition we made from Vagrant Cloud to Atlas.
We need this initializer so all extra initializers added in engines are consistently executed after all the initializers above across all engines.
We need this special case to avoid creating the pattern /**/* which searches the entire file system.
We need to apply this decorator here, rather than on module inclusion.
We need to avoid the following situation:
We need to build up mapping of directories that are enclosed within each other because the exports file has to have subdirectories of an exported directory on the same line.
We need to check both exit code and stderr.
We need to check declarations and comments
We need to create a Vagrantfile so that this test environment has a proper root path
We need to create a new class in order to install the new named route.
We need to disable eth0, see GH-2648
We need to do a merge, which we expect to be available on the config class itself.
We need to do that processing and can not use caching.
We need to find a forwarded port...
We need to get the machine ID from this Vagrant environment
We need to just set everything directly.
We need to make sure that no matter what this is always reset to false so we don't think we have a lock when we actually don't.
We need to recursively iterate over all `else` branches and consider all but the last `node` an `elsif` branch and consider the last `node` the actual `else` branch.
We need to recursively iterate over all `else` branches.
We need to remove all values, specifically:
We need to set BUNDLE_PATH because the existence of this actually suppresses `sudo`.
We need to sign the message in order to avoid padding attacks.
We need to store the RAILS_DEV_PATH in a constant, otherwise the path can change in Ruby 1.8.7 when we FileUtils.cd.
We need to undef `root`, RenderTestCases don't want this to be defined
We need to update our directory structure
We need to use a special communicator that proxies our SSH requests over our host VM to the container itself.
We need to verify the message in order to avoid padding attacks.
We note that we don't want to validate the configuration here, and we don't want to confirm we want to destroy.
We often find ourselves with a medium-sized chunk of behavior that we'd like to extract, but only mix in to a single class.
We often want to render different html/json/xml templates for phones, tablets, and desktop browsers.
We only care about checking folders that have a local path, meaning they were shared from the local machine, rather than assumed to exist on the VM.
We only care about directories
We only care about stdout and stderr output
We only care about the CPU sub-type.
We only handle private and public networks
We only lock if we're not executing an SSH action.
We only need the contents of the branch, not the condition.
We only need to forward ports if there are any to forward
We only support indirectly modifying through associations which have a belongs_to source.
We only want to deal with AR objects.
We only want to do this once per struct, so the struct is deleted after unpacking.
We only want unix-style line endings within Vagrant
We only work on the Docker provider
We override this in the sqlite3 and postgresql adapters to use only the column name (as per syntax requirements).
We override this, because XMLDecls and DocTypes must go at the start of the document
We place a process lock around every action that is called
We place the file in the include directory
We prefer `https` for security and proxy reasons.
We prefer find_all over select.
We prefer system `ln` over `FileUtils.ln_sf` because the latter seems to have weird failure conditions (that were observed in the past).
We prune these out in Specification._load, but if we don't have the constant, Marshal blows up.
We re-wrap ourselves in the safety net in case we upgraded.
We remove those if it was requested.
We represent the various high-level code constructs that appear in Ruby programs: classes, modules, methods, and so on.
We require that network adapter 1 is a NAT device.
We rescue these so that we can skip bad versions and continue walking the history
We retried already, raise the issue and be done
We retry here a few times because it can fail early on.
We return the directive name and any parameters as a two element array if the name is in +allowed+.
We run restart here instead of "update" just in case nfsd is not starting
We save the namespace prefix for the context node and convert it back when we write it.
We search for .rubocop.yml only if we haven't already found it for the given directory.
We see the RPAREN as the next token, so we need to exit early.
We select the dir as being case-sensitive if either the UPCASED or the downcased variant is missing.
We set overrides if they are set.
We set the ID of the machine to "preparing" so that we can use the data dir without it being deleted with the not_created state.
We should be able to close STDIN without raising an exception
We should decouple this from the AR::Base implementation.
We should get `old_backend` here even while another thread is using `new_backend`.
We should never reach this point, since the point of `ssh` is to exec into the proper SSH shell, but we'll just return an exit status of 0 anyways.
We should probably have a better mechanism for this than adding special cases to this method.
We should push this separation upstream
We silence warnings here because Vagrantfiles often have constants, so people would otherwise constantly (heh) get "already initialized constant" warnings.
We silently rollback this transaction without telling the user.
We skip this if the mount options contained a readonly flag, because it won't work.
We specifically do a manual INSERT here, and then test only the SELECT functionality.
We split the arguments into two: One set containing any flags before a word, and then the rest.
We start searching with the hosts with the most parents first.
We still need to keep checking all the permutations, but our probability of finding one will diminsh over time.
We still need to respect the source_reflection's :primary_key option, though.
We store our author information in a yaml file and specify the keys in The post front matter.
We store the temporary path as an instance variable so that the `#recover` method can access it.
We store this in a variable since we call it multiple times.
We test both setting a file multiple times as well as multiple loads, since both should not cache the data.
We then convert the namespace prefix for the node to the unique ID.
We then subclass the HTML output class to deal with these:
We timed out, we failed.
We track Thread objects, instead of just using counters, because we need exclusive locks to be reentrant, and we need to be able to upgrade share locks to exclusive.
We unset temporary bundler variables to load proper bundler and Gemfile.
We use Gem::Specification.reset the first time only so that if there are unresolved deps that leak into the whole test suite, they're at least reported once.
We use `raw` because it is okay if this fails.
We use a CRC32 to generate a 32-bit checksum so that the fsid is compatible with both old and new kernels.
We use a fully-qualified name in some strings, and a relative constant name in some other to test correct handling of both cases.
We use a leasing system of about 60 seconds to avoid any forwarded port collisions in a highly parallelized environment.
We use a provider capability if we have it.
We use forwardable to do all our driver forwarding
We use method_missing as a way to get the configuration that is used for Vagrant and load the proper configuration classes for each.
We use our object ID here to avoid conflicting with other instances
We use the MD5 of the local path so that it is predictable.
We use the optionparser for this.
We used to do this in the machine data dir but this can result in paths that are too long for unix domain sockets.
We want a nice table layout, so we allow space inside empty hashes.
We want crashes to show up the same in each run.
We want to change the preferred delimiters for word arrays.
We want to end up with a Time object with one-day resolution.
We want to generate the methods via module_eval rather than define_method, because define_method is slower on dispatch.
We want to make sure that the registered plugins remains empty after each test.
We want to rely on what has come before obviously, but with delegation we can take just the methods we need and even rename them as appropriate.
We want to use the klass from this reflection, rather than just delegate straight to the source_reflection, because the source_reflection may be polymorphic.
We want to warn the user but we only want to output once
We warn the use that this changed, but also silently change it to try to make things work properly.
We weren't given a provider, so store this one.
We will attempt to require the stdlib version
We will call it WeakHash, since it's really just a Hash except all of it's keys and values can be garbage collected.
We will investigate why this is in more detail for 1.8.0, but we wanted to fix this in a patch release and this was the hammer that did that.
We won't check modifier or ternary conditionals.
We wrap the check itself in a 5 second timeout because there are some cases where this will just hang.
We wrap the error in our own exception.
We wrap this in a thread because as of Ruby 2.0 we can't acquire locks in a trap context (ctrl-c), so we have to do this.
We wrap this in a timeout because once in awhile the TCPSocket _will_ hang, but this signals that the port is closed.
We'll store these for later.
We're already good, at the latest version.
We're being called in a trap-context.
We're disabling synced folders
We're done if it already exists
We're done with VM level errors so prepare the section

We're in a run command, so we do things a bit differently.
We're layering on additional behavior so that ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone instances are coerced into values that Time#- will recognize
We're looking for (block (send (const nil :Proc) :new) ...)
We're looking for (block (send nil :lambda) ...)
We're nested inside a +yield_shares+ call: we'll resume as soon as there isn't an exclusive lock in our way
We're now fenced, send all the data through
We're obliged to implement this (even though it doesn't actually get called here) to properly comply with the Rack SPEC
We're on a host VM, so we need to move our build dir to that machine.
We're only checking predicate methods.
We're preserving order, delete from other
We're ready if we can establish an SSH connection to the container
We're using NFS if we have any synced folder with NFS configured.
We've found that "end" is not aligned with the start node (which can be a block, a variable assignment, etc).
We've seen how to inspect local variables before:
We've specified the list of fruits on George's fixture, but we could've just as easily specified a list of monkeys on each fruit.
Weak ETags are considered to be semantically equivalent but not byte-for-byte identical.
Weak ETags are what we almost always need, so they're the default.

When you're using the flash, it's generally used as a conditional on the view.
When your JavaScript response loads on their site, it executes.
Whenever setting view paths, makes a copy so that we can manipulate them in instance objects as we wish.
Whenever streaming Cache-Control is automatically set to "no-cache".
Whenever the +render+ method is called on the base +Renderer+ class, a new renderer object of the correct type is created, and the +render+ method on that new object is called in turn.
Whenever you provide I18n.locale during a request, it will trigger the lookup_context and consequently expire the cache.
Where +argv+ is an array of strings, each corresponding to an argument you'd give rdoc on the command line.
Where +param_encoder+ defines how the params should be encoded and +response_parser+ defines how the response body should be parsed through +parsed_body+.
Where Encoding support is available, RDoc will automatically convert all documents to the same output encoding.
Where brews installed via URL are cached
Where build, postinstall, and test logs of formulae are written to
Where downloads (bottles, source tarballs, etc.) are cached
Where possible, prefer +wrap+.
Where shim scripts for various build and SCM tools are stored
Where we store built products
Where we store lock files
Where we store most of Homebrew, taps, and various metadata
Where we store symlinks to currently linked kegs
Where we store symlinks to currently version-pinned kegs
WhereChain objects act as placeholder for queries in which #where does not have any parameter.
Whether #io uses a File for the +input_method+ passed when creating the current context, see ::new
Whether +Readline+ is enabled or not.
Whether PStore should do its best to prevent file corruptions, even when under unlikely-to-occur error conditions such as out-of-space conditions and other unusual OS filesystem errors.
Whether Tracer is used when evaluating statements in this context.
Whether a given formula should be built from source during the current installation run.
Whether a one-to-one or one-to-many style form builder will be yielded depends on whether the normal reader method returns a _single_ object or an _array_ of objects.
Whether or not debug messages should be printed.
Whether or not super quiet mode is enabled.
Whether or not this VM has a functional vboxsf filesystem module.
Whether or not to preserve the order when merging this with a parent scope.
Whether that is a problem or not depends on the logic of the application, but in the particular case in which rows have a UNIQUE constraint an exception may be raised, just retry:
Whether the collection's documents ought to be written as individual files in the output.
Whether the end of this input method has been reached, returns +true+ if there is no more data to read.
Whether the file is published or not, as indicated in YAML front-matter
Whether the given cookie is to be deleted by this CookieJar.
Whether there are any expressions left in this printer.
Whether this input method is still readable when there is no more data to read.
Whether to close the underlying socket as well, when the SSL/TLS connection is shut down.
Whether to echo the return value to output or not.
Whether to generate an excerpt
Whether to output messages to the output method, depending on the level of this notifier object.
Whether to perform a full rebuild without incremental regeneration
Whether to print a backtrace along with the warning.
Whether to print a message (silent mode)
Whether to write the file to the filesystem
Whether verbose messages are displayed or not.
Which allows you to quickly change your code to:
Which are then automatically available to the view:
Which in turn means that the etag for a response should be computed with the content of the flash in mind.
Which is not the desired lookup.
Which means that the given method is private.
Which provides you with the full standard validation stack that you know from Active Record:
Which then will result in
Which will automatically create the file and fill it with the options you specified.
Which will render a +multipart/alternative+ email with +text/plain+ and +text/html+ parts.
Which will then result in the following:
Which would provide you with:
While +indent_string+ is typically one space or tab, it may be any string.
While I generally don't like the 'rescue' syntax, we do this to just fall back to the default value if it isn't dup-able.
While executing the given block, the recorded will be in reverting mode.
While it's blocked, it holds no lock, so it doesn't interfere with any other attempts.
While it's strongly recommended that you use key-based cache expiration (see links in CacheHelper for more information), it is also possible to manually expire caches.
While this class does neither the breaking into newlines nor indentation, it is used in a stack (as well as a queue) within PrettyPrint, to group objects.
While this method is provided so it can be used by plugin authors, application code should probably use ClassMethods#attribute.
While this provides the most flexibility, you can also unintentionally introduce dependencies on the underlying database.
White space (blanks, tabs, or newlines) in the format string matches any amount of white space, including none, in the input.
Whitelisted types are returned as-is.
Why this idiot standard still plagues us is beyond me.

WinRM can return multiple stderr and stdout entries
Windows FS do not support symlinks
Windows delays updating atime
Windows does not have symlink
Windows doesn't clear properly for some reason, so we just output one more newline.
Windows doesn't support atomic file renames.
Windows doesn't support non-blocking reads on file descriptors or pipes so we have to get a bit more creative.
Windows gems compiled with VC8
Windows guests most often use cygwin-dependent rsync utilities that expect "/cygdrive/c" instead of "c:" as the path prefix some vagrant code may pass guest paths with drive-lettered paths here
Wish this didn't happen in #setup
With +purpose+ matching, it is possible to yield only to other threads whose activity will not interfere.
With Ruby 1.8 CSV it's impossible to tell an empty line from a line containing a single +nil+ field.
With `--multiple`, :    only show formulae with multiple versions installed.
With `Module#delegate_missing_to`, the above is condensed to:
With a BacktraceCleaner, filters and silencers are used to remove the noisy lines, so that only the most relevant lines remain.
With a block scanf returns a 'map'-like array of transformations from the block -- that is, an array reflecting what the block did with each yielded result from the iterative scanf operation.
With a block which is passed with the current record to be validated:
With a regular #has_many there is no distinction between the "associated records" and the "link", so there is only one choice for what gets deleted.
With an isolated engine, the engine's namespace is automatically applied, so you don't need to specify it explicitly in your routes:
With carefully crafted JavaScript on their end, sensitive data in your JavaScript response may be extracted.
With help from WeakRef, we can implement our own rudimentary WeakHash class.
With layouts, you can flip it around and have the common structure know where to insert changing content.
With rubinius 2.0.0.rc1 + rspec 2.13.1, File.stub(:open).and_call_original causes SystemStackError.
With such an engine, everything that is inside the +MyEngine+ module will be isolated from the application.
With the above example, the bang and predicate methods along with the associated scopes are now prefixed and/or suffixed accordingly:
With the above example:
With the following gems already installed: a-1, b-1, c-1, e-1
With this you will have to limit your self to String keys, otherwise you will get an ArgumentError because WeakRef cannot create a finalizer for a Symbol.
With this, you simply do:
Within that is a hash where the key is the name of the capability and the value is the class/module implementing it.
Within the block we can substitute +sh.cd+ to +cd+, because the scope within the block uses +sh+ already.
Within the mailer method, you have access to the following methods:
Within the middleware sequences, some data must be put into the environment state bag:
Within these constraints, the document is pretty-printed, with whitespace inserted into the metadata to introduce formatting.
Without a block, scanf returns an array containing all the conversions it has found.
Without a file extension
Without a variable name to attach the glob parameter to, the route can't be parsed.
Without any +options+, the returned Hash will include all the model's attributes.
Without cache_classes + eager_load, the load interlock is required for proper operation
Without having extra_args be last, the user loses this ability
Without it, will not be able to unpack changes to the structure.
Without knowing the secret, the original value cannot be extracted from the message.
Without the alias, the column cannot be found and properly typecast.
Without this, the prior scheme will always equate to a higher version.
Without using prepared statements, it makes no sense to test BLOB data with DB2, because the length of a statement is limited to 32KB.
Without web-service support, an action which collects the data for displaying a list of people might look something like this:
Word-based markup uses flag characters around individual words:
Words not preceded by a short or long option flag are passed as arguments with an option of '' (empty string).
Work directory (the parent of .rubocop_cache) is removed afterwards anyway.

You should be sure to measure your actual performance across targeted browsers both before and after this change.
You should call #checkin when you no longer need this.
You should consult the documentation for your database to understand the semantics of these different levels:
You should disable those middlewares whenever streaming in development or production.
You should not use the +match+ method in your router without specifying an HTTP method.
You should prefer Timeout#timeout instead.
You should put the implementation of your command in rubygems/commands.

You typically won't use this module directly, you can see it implemented in OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket.
You usually don't use this directly and is intended for those needing to write new performance curve fits (eg: you need a specific polynomial fit).
You usually press +c+ when you are finished debugging your program and want to resume its execution.
You will have to rewrite those to the explicit form:
You will have to specify this when +sep+ is a multibyte character, for example.
You will need ordered fixtures when you have foreign key constraints on keys in the same table.
You will need to either:
You will need to require 'scanf' to use IO#scanf.
You will need to require 'scanf' to use Kernel#scanf.
You will need to require 'scanf' to use String#block_scanf
You will need to require 'scanf' to use String#scanf
You will need to require 'scanf' to use these methods Scans the current string.
You will obtain whatever was defined in +some_new_scope+.
You would use +content_for+ in your template to specify the title:
You'd need to provide an explicit QueryMethods#order option if you want the results are sorted.
You'll need to use a special comment format to call those out:
You'll notice that this next section is very similar to the same section in match(), but just a liiittle different.
You'll read permanent cookies through the regular accessor.
You'll see that appear accepts a data parameter, which it then uses as part of its model call.
You're encouraged to add a unique index in the database to deal with this even more unlikely scenario.
You're testing whether a transaction works correctly.
You're then responsible for dealing with the conflict by rescuing the exception and either rolling back, merging, or otherwise apply the business logic needed to resolve the conflict.
You've now added your public certificate as a trusted source.
Your CoffeeScript can then connect to the server without needing to specify the URL directly:
Your data is never transcoded (unless you ask Ruby to transcode it for you) and will literally be parsed in the Encoding it is in.
Your database does not support transactions.
Your first attempt is:
Your own parser is completely yours.
Your patch goes here.
Your primary database in the development environment is "my_application" but the Book model connects to a separate database called "library_db" (this can even be a database on a different machine).
Your server can also configure this for you by setting the X-Sendfile-Type header.
Zero parts are removed as not significant.
Zero precision with significant is a mistake (would always return zero), so we treat it as if significant was false (increases backwards compatibility for number_to_human_size)
Zlib::GzipWriter doesn't have some IO methods do nothing:  ensure will set default

if GCC 4.2 is installed, e.g. via Tigerbrew, prefer it over the system's GCC 4.0
if I'm honest we don't even need most of the base colors.
if TopLevel, it may not be registered in the classes:
if `gpg` is found, return its absolute path
if a character maps to nil then we delete it in the output.
if a method definition is inside an if, it is very likely that a different definition is used depending on platform, etc.
if a proc is passed to `Module#define_method`, `return` will not cause a non-local exit error
if a symbol is given we prepend the quoted table name
if a template has changed, it will be now be newer than all the cached templates
if at the second stage, return an empty string
if cond then a elsif cond then b end
if condition statement else statement end
if either of these is true the piece cannot be placed
if either the old or new template list is empty, we don't need to (and can't) compare modification times, and instead just check whether the lists are different
if empty, then it's impossible to split (parts is empty too)
if false, fail only if all slices fail.
if foreign keys are implemented and fixtures are not deleted in reverse order then this test case will raise StatementInvalid
if get EOF, raise EOFError
if host is not ip and matches domain regexp (ip confirms to domain regexp so we explicitly check for ip)
if host matches one of the supplied domains without a dot in front of it
if it doesn't properly say DROP TEMPORARY TABLE, the transaction commit will complain that no transaction is active
if it is a multiple of five it is removed.
if it is a setter, look for a getter
if it is an IO we need to go back to read the object
if it was there, then we keep it even if done_documenting
if it's a hangul syllable starter character
if it's already indented, don't bother indenting further
if it's set to nil or false
if methods are redefined).
if no short options match, try completion with long options.
if not running callbacks, only adds the record to the parent transaction
if nothing is found then try same procedure to find super class's layout.
if output is RD formatted
if output is target formatted
if path is a file in a keg then this will return the containing Keg object
if postproc is nil, this node is an abstract node.
if postproc is non-nil, this node is a real node.
if removing a connection that has a pool, we reset the connection_specification_name so it will use the parent pool.
if running just this test.
if some_condition do_something end
if something else went wrong this can't be a "naked" rescue, because we have should return conns even for non-StandardErrors
if structure is not loaded correctly, exception would be raised
if the accumulator parameter is assigned to in the block, then we can't convert to each_with_object
if the adapter doesn't support the indexes call, pick defaults that let the test pass
if the callback closed stdin, we should remove it, because IO.select() will throw if called with a closed io.
if the codepoint is decomposable in with the current decomposition type
if the cond node is literal we obviously have a problem
if the current controller is "foo/bar/baz" and controller: "baz/bat" is specified, the controller becomes "foo/baz/bat"
if the data is nil then we don't need to add keyword arguments because there is no data to put in params or headers, so skip
if the first word on the line is not an http method, then skip
if the format string is not empty there's a bug in the C code, ignore it
if the guest has a guest path scrubber capability, use it
if the line has already been converted to use keyword args then skip ie.
if the listening socket was closed in GenericServer#shutdown, IO::select raise it.
if the number is an integer, the number is represented in decimal form as a Number with no decimal point and no leading zeros, preceded by a minus sign (-) if the number is negative
if the right brace is on the same line as the last value, accept
if the right bracket is on the same line as the last value, accept
if the rotation is invalid at that location the mask will contain false
if the second_thread is not able to preempt the first_thread, they will temporarily (until either of them timeouts with ConnectionTimeoutError) deadlock and a join(2) timeout will be reached
if the uninstaller script isn't there, it's a good guess neither are any troublesome leftover Xcode files
if the user's flags will prevent bottle only-installations when no developer tools are available, we need to stop them early on
if there is a provided tld length then we use it otherwise default domain regexp
if this fails, try separate make/make install steps
if true make sure every write flushes
if true the underlying socket will be closed in SSLSocket#close.
if true, installs an "INFO" signal handler (only available to BSD and OS X users) which prints diagnostic information about the test run.
if user provided "name:index" instead of "name:string:index" type should be set blank so GeneratedAttribute's constructor could set it to :string
if we get current version during initialization, it happens stack over flow.
if we have build flags, we have to pass them to cabal install to resolve the necessary dependencies, and call cabal configure afterwards to set the flags again for compile
if we run out of data, it's probably a single line (ensure will set default value)
if we've already processed a file, ignore its hardlinks (which have the same dev ID and inode) this prevents relocations from being performed on a binary more than once

scanf can be called either with or without a block.
scanf for Ruby is based on something of an amalgam of C scanf implementations and documentation, rather than on a single canonical description.
scanf for Ruby is based on the C function scanf(3), but with modifications, dictated mainly by the underlying differences between the languages.
scanf for Ruby returns an array of successful conversions, whereas scanf(3) returns the number of conversions successfully completed.
scanf is an implementation of the C function scanf(3), modified as necessary for Ruby compatibility.
scanf itself calls FormatString#match, passing in the input string.
scanf was developed as the major activity of the Austin Ruby Codefest (Austin, Texas, August 2002).

this allows us to defer (expensive) field population until the very end
this branch is reached by two tests:
this can fail on adapters which require ORDER BY expressions to be included in the SELECT expression if the reorder clauses are not correctly handled
this cause "called on terminated object".
this controller exists in the admin namespace as well which is the only difference from previous test
this cop does not handle spaces after a ternary operator, which are instead handled by Style/SpaceAroundOperators.
this could fail due to gem dep collisions, go lax
this could probably be formatted more gracefully
this ensures that all producer threads call push before close
this error is more specific with a better error message directing the user towards the fact that it's probably a reportable bug
this fails if SSL_MODE_ACCEPT_MOVING_WRITE_BUFFER is missing:
