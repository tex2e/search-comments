Action Controller sends content to the user by using one of five rendering methods.
Action Mailer allows you to send email from your application using a mailer model and views.
Action Mailer is nicely integrated with Active Job so you can generate and send emails in the background (example: outside of the request-response cycle, so the user doesn't have to wait on it):
Action Mailer provides hooks into the Mail observer and interceptor methods.
Action Mailer provides some intelligent defaults for your emails, these are usually specified in a default method inside the class definition:
Action View contexts are supplied to Action Controller to render a template.
Action View templates can be written in several ways.
Action template sets variable that's picked up by layout
ActionCable.server.broadcast "comments_for_45", author: 'DHH', content: 'Rails is just swell'
ActionCable.server.remote_connections.where(current_user: User.find(1)).disconnect

Active Job has adapters for the following queueing backends:
Active Job has two built-in queue adapters intended for development and testing: +:async+ and +:inline+.
Active Job objects can be configured to work with different backend queuing frameworks.
Active Job objects can be defined by creating a class that inherits from the ActiveJob::Base class.
Active Job provides hooks during the life cycle of a job.
Active Record allows inheritance by storing the name of the class in a column that is named "type" by default.
Active Record associations can be used to describe one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many relationships between models.
Active Record can serialize any object in text columns using YAML.
Active Record collections delegate their representation in XML to this method.
Active Record looks at the fixture's model class, discovers the correct primary key, and generates it right before inserting the fixture into the database.
Active Record objects don't specify their attributes directly, but rather infer them from the table definition with which they're linked.
Active Record saves the ids of the records from the first query to use in the second.
Active Record supports multiple database systems.
Active Record supports optimistic locking if the +lock_version+ field is present.
Active Record takes care of building the query to avoid injection attacks, and will convert from the ruby type to the database type where needed.
Active Record uses table aliasing in the case that a table is referenced multiple times in a join.
Active Record won't persist value objects that have been changed through means other than the writer method.
Active Records accept constructor parameters either in a hash or as a block.
ActiveModel is a class to be implemented by each ORM to allow Rails to generate customized controller code.

Also indicates there's a line break.
Also known as accessing "the reddit".
Also known simply as +ARGV+.

An element is an array.
An element with a +nil+ value in a template acts as a wildcard, matching any value in the corresponding position in the tuple.
An else branch does not, since it doesn't add a decision point.

An email was generated.
An email was received.

An expected place for this code would be +lib/constraints+.
An ignored item will not be displayed in documentation.

An object hierarchy may be just a single object.
An object in a remote process is locally represented by a DRb::DRbObject instance.
An object is blank if it's false, empty, or a whitespace string.

And 65536 times loop could not be enough for forcing PID recycle.
And Net::IMAP::BodyTypeMessage has all methods of Net::IMAP::BodyTypeText.
And Net::IMAP::BodyTypeText has all fields of Net::IMAP::BodyTypeBasic.
And a database.yml that looked like this:
And also, there are some aliases for convenience:
And an instance method _routes.
And both aliases are set up for you.
And changes the original string:
And check that these changes are reflected in dump
And convert out comment block to html.
And finally they can also be removed from the stack completely:
And given the following code:
And here is an even shorter example.
And if it does, some rule about whitespace may or may not be in effect...
And if you want to use 'remote-tk.rb', give option '--remote-tk'.
And in another place:
And instantiate will find the existing constant rather than trying to require firm_on_the_fly.
And it will be wrapped into a nested hash with the key name matching the controller's name.
And it's finally registered as:
And it's likely a Github repository with the name of `user/homebrew-repo`.
And now it will look for all templates at "app/views/notifications" with name "another".
And now it will look up at:
And nsdispatch(3) doesn't call dlerror(3) even if it calls _nss_cache_cycle_prevention_function with dlsym(3).
And of course you can just create a bare object and specify the attributes after the fact:
And of course, you can put as many as you like at a time too.
And our hypothetical infrastructure is missing a certificate revocation system.
And pass the bind values as the first argument of +execute+ call.
And retrieved again through the same hash:
And sometimes you need to do something in SQL not abstracted directly by migrations:
And the expected template will be used.
And the final result would be:
And the lookup is exactly the same as previously:
And then you have content pages that look like this:
And this is the second paragraph.
And this test failed as expected.
And use it on initialization:
And when hit "Return" key on the entry box after modifying the text, the entry box is closed and the item is changed.
And when include, you can use utility methods like a function.
And you can do the same thing with the private key file as well:
And, like this (xml-encoded):
Annotations are looked for in comments and modulus whitespace they have to start with the tag optionally followed by a colon.
Annoying hack warnings
Annoyingly, the code for prepared statements whose return value may have changed is FEATURE_NOT_SUPPORTED.
AnonClass is currently not used.
Anonymous modules aren't autoloaded.
Anonymous modules cannot follow these conventions and therefore we assume that the user wants to refer to a top-level constant.
Anonymous suites must be disabled to use peer verification."
Another case is `binding`:
Another common use case is optimistic locking handling:
Another entry point for the parser.
Another longer example would be:
Another name for Timeout::Error, defined for backwards compatibility with earlier versions of timeout.rb.
Another program may use the port.
Another round of autocorrection is needed
Another round of inspection will be done, and any other offenses will be caught then, so we don't need to continue.

Anything *not* in this set is provided by the English library.
Anything else is assumed to be a lone field which is appended with a +nil+ header.
Anything else is blank, some user type, or some function and we can't know the value of that, so return nil.
Anything else is considered columnar access.
Anything else than UTF-8 is implemented by converting to UTF-8, which makes it slower than UTF-8.
Anything using `etc.install` will not overwrite other files on e.g. upgrades but will write a new file named `*.default`.
Anything with a scope can additionally ruin our attempt at finding an inverse, so we exclude reflections with scopes.
Anything you place in the flash will be exposed to the very next action and then cleared out.
Anyway it's no effect bit.
Anyway the addresses are used for bind() and should be failed.
Anyway, the practical side of this is simple:  make sure IO and String objects passed into CSV have the proper Encoding set and everything should just work.
Apparently it will be changed in the future.

As a consequence changes to the database are not seen outside your connection until the operation is complete.
As a response to any other command, it indicates either that the server is shutting down, or that the server is timing out the client connection due to inactivity.
As a rule of thumb you can think of +camelize+ as the inverse of underscore, though there are cases where that does not hold:
As a rule of thumb you can think of +underscore+ as the inverse of camelize, though there are cases where that does not hold:
As a side effect, the IO buffer is flushed before determining the size.
As a simplistic example:
As a special case, `--version` is implemented directly in `brew.rb`.
As a special exception, when this code is copied by Racc into a Racc output file, you may use that output file without restriction.
As an alternative, it is recommended to use one of the following methods.
As an engine can now be a rack endpoint, it can also have a middleware stack.
As an example, the built-in +Time+ conversion is used.
As an example, we might have an extension that defines multiple classes in its Init_xxx method.
As an input to the initializer, we take a Fixnum, a String, or a Symbol.
As blocks (or rather the Proc objects that represent them) are not marshallable, the block executes in the local, not the remote, context.
As explained in Channel, most of the time, these broadcastings are streamed directly to the clients subscribed to the named broadcasting.
As long as the indentation of this method is consistent with that of the last one, we're fine.
As long as there's at least one comment line that isn't an annotation, it's OK.
As much character data as possible is grouped into each text node: a text node never has an immediately following or preceding sibling that is a text node.
As of the beginning of October, 2011, no gem includes nonexistent modules.
As such, changes to `lock_optimistically`, or `locking_column` would not be picked up.
As such, changes to `time_zone_aware_attributes`, or `skip_time_zone_conversion_for_attributes` would not be picked up.
As such, we convert to a relative path unless we are using Ruby 1.9.x on Windows.
As such, you probably want to tighten it from the default.
As the primaries didn't hold a share lock, as soon as the outer one was released, all the exclusive locks are free to be acquired in turn.
As this is both cryptic and usually redundant, it should be avoided.
As this is the most popular route of most Rails applications, this is beneficial.
As we are using Action View's +image_tag+ method, you can pass in any other options you want:
As we haven't started doing any real work yet, we should pretend that we never made it off the queue.
As with "to", all URL reserved characters must be encoded.
As with +belongs_to+, Active Record reflects on the fixture's model class and discovers the +has_and_belongs_to_many+ associations.
As with all network services, security needs to be considered when using dRuby.
As you can pass in any header, you need to either quote the header as a string, or pass it in as an underscored symbol, so the following will work:
As you can see the integration test involves multiple controllers and exercises the entire stack from database to dispatcher.
As you can see, this is a very Builder-like DSL.
As you see the proc takes a +source+ parameter.
As you see, the HTML reflects knowledge about the resource in several spots, like the path the form should be submitted to, or the names of the input fields.
As you see, we use the output embeddings for the render methods.
As you're unlikely to write code that can accept values of any type this is rarely a problem in practice.

Assets are stored under files, and copied to output/files as part of the generation process.
Assign any deferred nested attributes after the base attributes have been set.
Assign the rendered format to look up context.
Assign unique IDs to invocations of `cmd_output`.
Assigning the same value leaves the attribute unchanged:
Assigning to a _name_ already in the data store clobbers the old data.
Assigning to an existing column or row clobbers the data.
Assigning to an unused header appends the new pair.
Assigning to new columns creates them at the right end of the table.
Assignment of inner structure to variable is very important here.

Assigns the given attributes to the association.
Assigns the given attributes to the collection association.
Associating new records always saves them Thus, 1 query for the new person record, 1 query for the new join table record
Association methods are generated in a module that is included into the model class, which allows you to easily override with your own methods and call the original generated method with +super+.
Association name or counter name can be given.
Association with autosave option defines several callbacks on your model (before_save, after_create, after_update).

At each point the issuer runs the same command:
At first, tries to create a new URI::Generic instance using URI::Generic::build.
At least one of +row_count+ or +column_count+ must be 0.
At one time, there was a problem with the psych YAML engine under Ruby 1.9.3.
At present, only GIF and PPM/PGM formats are supported, but an interface exists to allow additional image file formats to be added easily.
At rendering time, the content page is computed and then inserted in the layout, like this:
At the beginning, do not consider class default for content_type
At the database-level, the actions performed by these users could be interleaved in the following manner:
At the end of processing a file RDoc allows all classes and modules to add new documentation to previously created classes.
At the end of the block, changes are committed to the data store automatically.
At the lowest level, is an event based parser.
At the mid level is building an AST.
At the moment, only internal entities are processed.
At the read uncommitted level, there is nothing that must not happen.
At the same time, make sure Tap is not a shallow clone.
At the time of writing, the only database that supports true nested transactions that we're aware of, is MS-SQL.
At the time of writing, the only database that we're aware of that supports true nested transactions, is MS-SQL.
At the top of a file the +:markup:+ directive applies to the entire file:
At this point you should know how to do all of these new and interesting things:
At this size, the increased overhead can be a reasonable tradeoff even if it reduces our at-a-glance perception of how things work.
At this time Net::HTTP does not support multipart/form-data.
At this time there is no easy way to get an interface index by name.
Atlantic/Reykjavik is "a time zone at Universal Time".

BACKCOMPAT If the file is coming out of a specified file, then we ignore the platform.
BAD:: the request from the client does not follow the server's understanding of the IMAP protocol.
BCrypt hash function can handle maximum 72 characters, and if we pass password of length more than 72 characters it ignores extra characters.

Back transformation to get eigenvectors of original matrix
Backburner is a beanstalkd-powered job queue that can handle a very high volume of jobs.
Backtrace and config-file are added so they show up in the help commands.
Backtraces often include many lines that are not relevant for the context under review.
Backup everything if errors occured while migrating.
Backup of Math is needed because mathn.rb replaces Math with CMath.
Backup tests are divided into three groups: when oldname Cellar is deleted and when it still exists and when it's a symlink
Bail out if there is no SDK prefix at all
Base class for AggregateReflection and AssociationReflection.
Base class for all URI classes.

Based on Tcl/Tk8.5a2 widget demos.
Based on the above example, the subscribers of this channel will get whatever data is put into the, let's say, `comments_for_45` broadcasting as soon as it's put there.
Based on the widget demo of Tcl/Tk8.5.2 The following is the original copyright text.
Based on this fact, this method only understands the time zone abbreviations described in RFC 822 and the system time zone, in the order named.
Basic functionality (wait until specified threads have terminated) can be accessed through the class method ThreadsWait::all_waits.
Basic implementation of url_for to allow use helpers without routes existence
Basic mail usage without block
Basic motion handler.
BasicObject has no ancestors
Basically there are two different styles:
Basically, calls Parent.replace_child
Be advised, RDoc will not detect delegated methods.
Be aware that these columns use a string keyed hash and do not allow access using a symbol.
Be aware that this causes the stream to be parsed up to the +depth+ event, so you can effectively pre-parse the entire document (pull the entire thing into memory) using this method.
Be aware that this method only returns the first Text node.
Be aware, though, that the objects will _not_ have their instance data returned to their pre-transactional state.
Be careful because this also means you're initializing a model object with only the fields that you've selected.
Be careful to sanitize the path parameter if it is coming from a web page.
Be careful when using the older argument style, as an extra literal hash is needed:
Be careful which directory is specified in your config file when using +FileStore+ because everything in that directory will be deleted.
Be careful with this method since it could affect other processes if shared cache is being used.
Be careful you don't leave a quote unmatched.
Be conservative and return false if we're not sure
Be conservative and return true if we're not sure
Be lazy computing stuff to have as light impact as possible to the rest of tasks.
Be significantly faster than CSV while remaining a pure Ruby library.
Be sure to declare +define_attribute_method+ after you define any prefix, suffix or affix method, or they will not hook in.
Be sure to declare +define_attribute_methods+ after you define any prefix, suffix or affix methods, or they will not hook in.
Be sure to include shadowed public instance methods of this class
Be sure to look at the documentation of those specific classes for more information.
Be sure to specify the same class as the +value_method+ when specifying selected or disabled options.
Be sure to stringify the id for routes
Be sure to use the same DigestAuth instance for multiple requests as it saves state between requests in order to perform authentication.
Be warned that this discards field order and clobbers duplicate fields.
Be warned that your attributes are not copied.
Bear in mind that GET and HEAD requests are not checked.
Because CookieStore extends Rack::Session::Abstract::Persisted, many of the options described there can be used to customize the session cookie that is generated.
Because I have no test-environment.
Because callbacks are run in the order they are defined, associated objects may need to be explicitly saved in any user-defined +before_save+ callbacks.
Because chunked encoding is HTTP/1.1 feature, you must confirm the server to support HTTP/1.1 before sending it.
Because irb evaluates input immediately after it is syntactically complete, the results may be slightly different than directly using Ruby.
Because it is silent.
Because it may be necessary to modify the body, Eg, decompression this method facilitates that.
Because of extended life of the previous cache, other processes will continue to use slightly stale data for a just a bit longer.
Because of how the rescue clauses come out of Parser, these are special and need to be tested.
Because of line breaks, we will only find the beginning.
Because of the way the CSV format works, it's common for a parser to need to read until the end of the file to be sure a field is invalid.
Because of this, Active Record emulates nested transactions by using savepoints on MySQL and PostgreSQL.
Because of this, you probably only want to change delegation to objects of the same type as the original delegate.
Because the IMAP class uses Sockets for communication, its methods are also susceptible to the various errors that can occur when working with sockets.
Because the Logger's level is set to +WARN+, only the warning, error, and fatal messages are recorded.
Because the created class is frozen after evaluating the block.
Because the generated param begins with the record's +id+, it is suitable for passing to +find+.
Because the user can switch the YAML engine behind our back, we have to check again here to make sure that our psych code was properly loaded, and load it if not.
Because the widget no longer exist when returning from creation.
Because this transformation is idempotent, this helper can be applied even if +ActiveSupport.escape_html_entities_in_json+ is already true.
Because we assumed all classes without a stated superclass inherit from Object, we have the above wrong inheritance.
Because you can instantiate multiple sessions and run them side-by-side, you can also mimic (to some limited extent) multiple simultaneous users interacting with your system.
Because, unknown_proc may be "command + some arguments".
Before and After hooks
Before callbacks should also be executed as early as possible, so also include them at the bottom.
Before changes, the floating point numbers will be interpreted as table names and will cause this to run in one query
Before each constant is removed a callback is sent to its class/module if it implements +before_remove_const+.
Before option processing in +rdoc+, RDoc::Options will call ::setup_options on the generator class with an RDoc::Options instance.
Before processing, set the request formats in current controller formats.

Confusingly, executables (e.g. config scripts) are only found under /opt/X11/bin or /usr/X11/bin in all cases.
Connect to IO +tcp+, with context of the current certificate configuration
Connect to the database
Connecting to the DB is done outside main synchronized section.
Connection details inside of the "url" key win any merge conflicts
Connection pool allows for concurrent (outside the main +synchronize+ section) establishment of new connections.
Connection pool base class for managing Active Record database connections.
ConnectionHandler is a collection of ConnectionPool objects.
ConnectionPool is completely thread-safe, and will ensure that a connection cannot be used by two threads at the same time, as long as ConnectionPool's contract is correctly followed.
Connections can be obtained and used from a connection pool in several ways:
Connections in the pool are actually AbstractAdapter objects (or objects compatible with AbstractAdapter's interface).
Connections must be leased while holding the main pool mutex.
Connects to a PostgreSQL server and sets up the adapter depending on the connected server's characteristics.
Consecutive lines starting at this margin are considered to be a paragraph.
Consequently, assert_migration accepts the same arguments has assert_file.

Constant for relieving Ruby's garbage collector.
Constant of Encoding Auto-Detect
Constant or class methods
Constant time string comparison.
Constant values can be supplied on the first line of the comment like so:
Constants +PROMPT_I+, +PROMPT_S+ and +PROMPT_C+ specify the format.
Constants are defined in Logger namespace: +DEBUG+, +INFO+, +WARN+, +ERROR+, +FATAL+, or +UNKNOWN+.
Constants do not necessarily rely on digest/*.
Constants like __FILE__ are handled as strings, but don't respond to begin.
Constants may only be regarded as 'new' once -- so if the block calls +new_constants_in+ again, then the constants defined within the inner call will not be reported in this one.
Constants that "depend" needs.
Constants that define a node's type
Constants that define types for IXMLElement.
Constraints can include the 'ignorecase' and 'extended syntax' regular expression modifiers:
Construct a new BlockCaller object.

Currently Htgroup is not directly integrated with any authenticators in WEBrick.
Currently Net::IMAP supports the authentication mechanisms:
Currently implemented by belongs_to (vanilla and polymorphic) and has_one/has_many :through associations which go through a belongs_to.
Currently it checks for code like this:
Currently only Basic Authentication is implemented, no Digest.
Currently only RDoc::Extend and RDoc::Include are supported.
Currently there is no direct API for dumping Ruby structure to file:
Currently this cop has advanced logic that detects unreferenced reassignments and properly handles varied cases such as branch, loop, rescue, ensure, etc.
Currently, if passed userinfo components this method generates invalid HTTP URIs as per RFC 1738.
Currently, this cop completely ignores strings with invalid encoding If it could handle them and still report an offense when appropriate, that would be even better
Currently, we use the Gauss-Bareiss algorithm
Currently, when an exception happens in development or production, Rails will automatically stream to the client:

For example, +Post.all+ may return Comments, Messages, and Emails by storing the record's subclass in a +type+ attribute.
For example, +UsersController+ will try to find if the +User+ model exists.
For example, +auth_type+ will return the environment variable +AUTH_TYPE+, and +accept+ will return the value for +HTTP_ACCEPT+.
For example, If you wanted to create a +member+ named _joe_ and wanted to update the +posts+ at the same time, that would give an ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound error.
For example, Object.const_get('::String') raises NameError and so does qualified_const_get.
For example, Rails::Generators::ModelGenerator will return "model" as generator name.
For example, SQLite does not understand dates, so this method will convert a Date to a String.
For example, `lvar` and `send` type nodes are initially created as an `ident` type node and fixed to the appropriate type later.
For example, a +DiscussionBoard+ may cache posts_count and comments_count to avoid running an SQL query to calculate the number of posts and comments there are, each time it is displayed.

For example, if we have a +User+ model with +category_ids+ field and we have the following code in our update action:
For example, if we have the following:
For example, if we wanted it to be +user+ instead of +account+ we'd do:
For example, if you are attempting to get the current_scope for the +Board+ model, then you would use the following code:
For example, if you pass "test/foo" as a target name, your extension will be installed under the "test" directory.
For example, if you replace the +current_user.to_json+ in the example above with user input instead, the browser will happily eval() that string as JavaScript.
For example, if you serve pages tailored depending on who's logged in at the moment, you may want to add the current user id to be part of the ETag to prevent unauthorized displaying of cached pages.
For example, if you try to update the index of a search engine in +after_save+ the indexer won't see the updated record.
For example, if you want to check for +uniqueness+ with +hstore+ you will need to use a custom validation to handle it.
For example, if you wanted to treat all two digit years prior to 70 as the year 2000+ you could write this:
For example, if you're posting to +UsersController+, your new +params+ hash will look like this:
For example, if you've created a savepoint, then you execute a CREATE TABLE statement, then the savepoint that was created will be automatically released.
For example, if your C extension is defined as +Init_foo+, then your target would simply be "foo".
For example, imagine the following +dashboard+ action:
For example, in most cases you can use this to access +libc+ functions, or ruby functions like +rb_str_new+.
For example, in the controller you could write this:
For example, in the resource generator, the controller should be invoked with a pluralized class name.
For example, it can be implemented as follows using Ruby/ProgressBar.
For example, let's say you made a helper to automatically add labels to form inputs.
For example, lines like "else do_something".
For example, making sure that a teacher can only be on the schedule once per semester for a particular class.

For example, shoulda is considered a test_framework and is an extension of test_unit.
For example, something like
For example, specifying +:books+ allows this method to preload all books for an Author.
For example, suppose a person has many projects, and each project has many tasks.
For example, suppose that two users try to post a Comment at the same time, and a Comment's title must be unique.
For example, suppose that you have 5 models, with the following hierarchy:
For example, test_accept_blank_line sets up a RDoc::Markup::BlockLine then calls accept_blank_line on your visitor.
For example, the abbreviation "CST" is used variously as:
For example, the above header was obtained with:
For example, the built-in converters will try to transcode data to UTF-8 before making conversions.
For example, the call above is converted to:

For example, the previous example could be rewritten as:
For example, the rake gem has rake as an executable.
For example, the tables "catalog_categories" and "catalog_products" generate a join table name of "catalog_categories_products".
For example, these two snippets have the same output:
For example, this method could generate the following:

For example, to add a condition:
For example, to allow Date deserialization:
For example, to compare ways to sort an array of floats:
For example, to detect when the server sends a new EXISTS response (which normally indicates new messages being added to the mailbox), add the following handler after selecting the mailbox:
For example, we could add WikiWords using something like:
For example, webrat developers might want to have webrat available on controller generator.
For example, when RuboCop inspects 2 files, the invocation order should be like this:
For example, when there are two placeholders with only one value supplied:
For example, when you have defined `MyCustomFormatter` in `./path/to/my_custom_formatter.rb`, you would type this command:

For example, you can also do this:
For example, you can use that when manually building SQL strings:
For example, you could do this in your controller to rollback a transaction:
For example, you may want to prefix all fragment cache keys with a global version identifier, so you can easily invalidate all caches.

For floats use assert_in_delta.
For floats use refute_in_delta.
For full-class delegation via DelegateClass, see +delegate.rb+.
For further configuration details see RDoc::Task.
For gem developer documentation see:
For hash conditions, you can either use the table name in the key, or use a sub-hash.
For historical reasons, the 'media' attribute will always be present and defaults to "screen", so you must explicitly set it to "all" for the stylesheet(s) to apply to all media types.
For information about how to change the default Multibyte behavior see ActiveSupport::Multibyte.
For information on using the high level parser see Psych.load
For instance if the template the collection renders is cached like:
For instance methods the class name is used if +context+ does not match the parent.
For instance, "1 minute" is actually 30s to 1m29s.
For instance, +attributes+ and +connection+ would be bad choices for association names.
For instance, a time + 24.hours will advance exactly 24 hours, while a time + 1.day will advance 23-25 hours, depending on the day.
For instance, a time - 24.hours will go subtract exactly 24 hours, while a time - 1.day will subtract 23-25 hours, depending on the day.
For instance, an HTTP controller with a template matching the action name is considered to exist.
For instance, any method that involves sending a request to the server and/or receiving a response from it could raise an Errno::EPIPE error if the network connection unexpectedly goes down.
For instance, if we have the following template:
For instance, if you want to have a development set of documentation including private methods:
For instance, in a production system, you may have your Logger set to +INFO+ or even +WARN+.

For instance, suppose the request contains the parameter "favourite_colours" with the multiple values "blue" and "green".
For instance, take the following tests:
For instance, the default prompt mode is defined as follows:
For instance, the template above using +provide+ would be:
For instance, you can figure out the name of a table from the name of a class.
For instance: +json+ and +jsonb+ types in PostgreSQL will be converted between JSON object/array syntax and Ruby +Hash+ or +Array+ objects transparently.
For just one comment:
For many resources, loose upgrades are sufficient: if a thread is awaiting a lock, it is not running any other code.
For modern shells (e.g. bash, zsh, etc.), you can use shell completion for command line options.
For more advanced details on the implementation see Psych, and also check out http://yaml.org for spec details and other helpful information.

For now I'm assuming that I can substitute a character in the range 0..8 for a 7 bit character without damaging the encoded string, but this might be optimistic ++
For now this documents existing behavior.
For now we're not interested in additional capability bits also to be found in the `cpusubtype` field.
For now, action_controller must always be present with rails, so let's make sure that it gets required before here.
For now, only check the description when using `--strict`
For now, the user has to synchronize the schema manually.
For now, we assume that lists are 2 items or less.
For older versions you can use the queue_classic-later gem.
For one-to-one nested associations, if you build the new (in-memory) child object yourself before assignment, then this module will not overwrite it, e.g.:
For optimistic locking
For options that require an argument, option specification strings may include an option name in all caps.
For options, see +match+, as +mount+ uses it internally.
For options, see +match+, as +root+ uses it internally.
For other adapters you will have to parse the (database-specific) exception message to detect such a case.
For other stores the source is the path.
For performance critical pages, selecting only the required fields can be an easy performance win (assuming you aren't using all of the fields on the model).
For performance reasons, we don't check whether to validate at runtime.
For polymorphic relationships, find the foreign key and type: PriceEstimate.where(estimate_of: treasure)
For queries selecting a subset of columns, return false for unselected columns.
For queries, CGI provides methods to get at environmental variables, parameters, cookies, and multipart request data.
For ranges with line breaks, we look a the last code line.
For redirects within the same controller, you can even call follow_redirect and the redirect will be followed, triggering another action call which can then be asserted against.
For removing objects from the session, you can either assign a single key to +nil+:
For responses, CGI provides methods for writing output and generating HTML.
For ri, the server runs on port 8214 by default.
For scope names which contain spaces this approach doesn't work.
For security, the path for a digest password database should be stored outside of the paths available to the HTTP server.
For security, the path for a password database should be stored outside of the paths available to the HTTP server.
For server operations:
For short style, only portion matched to argument pattern is treated as argument.
For single line ranges, this is simple.
For single-table inheritance, we check the record for a +type+ column and return the corresponding class.
For some session storage types, this is a no-op.
For standard installs, :    the `prefix` and `repository` are the same directory.
For startup plists, we cannot tell whether it's running on launchd, as it requires for `sudo launchctl list` to get real result.
For streaming, instead of rendering a given a template, we return a Body object that responds to each.
For string and array conditions, use the table name in the condition.
For system ri store (the standard library documentation) the source is"ruby".
For testing layouts which are set automatically
For the +rdoc-label+ scheme the footnote and label prefixes are stripped when creating a link.
For the +rdoc-ref+ scheme the named reference will be returned without creating a link.
For the default 'aes-256-cbc' cipher, this is 256 bits.
For the families available for +host+, returns a TCPServer on +port+.
For the last example, single-digit versions are automatically extended with a zero to give a sensible result.
For the list of those files and their copying conditions, see the file LEGAL.
For the lower components, the minimum values (1 or 0) are assumed if broken or missing.
For the rdoc-ref scheme the cross-reference will be looked up and the given name will be used.
For the rest of this documentation, when we say "UTF-8", we mean "UTF-8 or whatever the default_internal encoding is set to".
For the simple, default case, just copy it over.
For this purpose, you can use a helper called +provide+ that does the same as +content_for+ but tells the layout to stop searching for other entries and continue rendering.
For this, you need to create a config file as follow:
For use by formatters only (caches its result).
For use by the Gem.done_installing hook
For use with legacy gems.
For user access logging:
For user documentation, see:
For versions of Ruby built on MS Windows with VC++ or Borland it will return 'nmake'.
Force a row to have a JSON "null" instead of a database NULL (this is how null values are saved on 4.1 and before)

Form helpers are designed to make working with resources much easier compared to using vanilla HTML.
FormData objects are created when WEBrick::HTTPUtils.parse_form_data is called.
Format a +Time+ object as a String using the format specified by RFC 1123.
Format list items of renamed formulae
Format of the timestamp which is applied to each logged line.
Format string for IPv6
Formats +time+ as an IMAP-style date-time.
Formats +time+ as an IMAP-style date.
Formats a +number+ into a phone number (US by default e.g., (555) 123-9876).
Formats a +number+ with grouped thousands using +delimiter+ (e.g., 12,324).
Formats can have different variants.
Formats the bytes in +number+ into a more understandable representation (e.g., giving it 1500 yields 1.5 KB).
FormattedTimeHelper can now be included in a controller, using the +helper+ class method:
Formatters are a visitor that converts an RDoc::Markup tree (from a comment) into some kind of output.
Formerly used to indicate this gem was RDoc-capable.
Formula dependencies can override standard tools.
Formula info drawn from an external "brew info --json" call
Formula name must be set after the DSL, as we have no access to the formula name before initialization of the formula
Formulae which do not meet the above requirements should not be bottled.

Fortran 90 environment var has a different name
Forward all undefined methods to the wrapped string.
Forward only valid config params to PGconn.connect.
Fragment caching is used for caching various blocks within views without caching the entire action as a whole.

From a user's perspective, the easiest thing to do is to save your templates as UTF-8.
From here you can extend an object with Mutex instance methods:
From ruby/test/ruby/test_eval.rb
From the REXML tutorial (http://www.germane-software.com/software/rexml/test/data/tutorial.html)
From the moment you require "config/application.rb" in your app, the booting process goes like this:
From the outside, you use such an object by calling the start_collecting_tokens method, followed by calls to add_token and pop_token.

However "can't resolve symbol 'dbm_clearerr'" problem may be caused by header/library mismatch: Berkeley DB ndbm.h and GDBM library until 1.8.3.
However actual outputs may overflow +maxwidth+ if long non-breakable texts are provided.
However all sockets in the result has same port number.
However if the +:dependent+ value is +:destroy+ then in that case the +:delete_all+ deletion strategy for the association is applied.
However it fails on Rubinius 2.2.9 due to its bug:
However it is not declared by ndbm.h until GDBM 1.8.3.
However the validation and callback methods are lazy and those methods get created when they are invoked for the very first time.
However we may well contain subdirectories which must be tested for .document files.
However you can still overwrite individual conventions, such as:
However, PostgreSQL will cast the default to the columns type, which leaves us with a default like "default NULL::character varying".
However, a session id must be passed backwards and forwards between client and server to maintain a reference to this session state.
However, after insert_record has been called, the cache is cleared in order to allow multiple instances of the same record in an association.
However, currently it's unclear whether there's a way to emit this warning without syntax errors.
However, editline (NetBSD 6.1.3, 2014) doesn't have rl_hook_func_t.
However, if +content_for+ is called several times, the final result would have all calls concatenated.
However, if a block has been passed, that block will be passed the key and executed in the event of a cache miss.
However, if an object cannot be marshalled, a dRuby reference to it is passed or returned instead.
However, if the date component is not provided, but any other upper components are supplied, then the day of the month defaults to 1:
However, if there is a WHERE clause that spans across tables Active Record will fall back to a slightly more resource-intensive single query:
However, if we know that a certain node type (like `int`) never has child nodes, there is no reason to pay the cost of calling `super`.
However, if you don't need stderr output, you can use Open3.popen2.
However, if you supply validate: false, validations are bypassed altogether.
However, if you want to place your generators at a different location, you can specify in your railtie a block which will load them during normal generators lookup:
However, in MySQL it is advised to add a compound index for both of the columns as MySQL only uses one index per table during the lookup.
However, it does not know what attributes are legal for which elements.
However, it is brave new code and may have some bugs.
However, it is not valid to have more than one radiobutton in a group checked.
However, it is possible to implement an alternative marshalling scheme as part of an implementation of the transport layer.
However, it may be difficult for current Tcl/Tk (Tcl/Tk8.5.1), because it seems to require to modify Tcl/Tk's source code.
However, it may be troublesome for Ruby/Tk users who use such Tcl/Tk scripts as it is.
However, it may break multi-byte characters.
However, most part of shoulda generators are similar to test_unit ones.
However, on Ruby 1.9.x on Windows, relative paths cause all C extension builds to fail.
However, since MySQL doesn't support DDL transactions, creating a table will result in any created savepoints to be automatically released.
However, sometimes you want to isolate your engine from the application, especially if your engine has its own router.
However, tests didn't show any noticeable speedup when doing this.
However, that would break proxy farms, where requests from a single user often go through different proxies in the farm.
However, the above applies if the parent model is being updated as well.
However, the buffer in a timeout session is kept for the next expect call.
However, the button tag does allow for richer labels such as images and emphasis, so this helper will also accept a block.
However, the following is true:
However, the full package also includes access control lists and the Rinda tuple-space distributed task management system, as well as a large number of samples.
However, the value is not a string, but an IO object, either an IOString for small files, or a Tempfile for larger ones.
However, there are examples where this strategy doesn't make sense.
However, they are supported by Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Safari.
However, this can change, for instance, when using nested attributes, which is called _after_ the association has been defined.
However, this does not allow for LIMIT, OFFSET and ORDER.
However, this limit can cause a legitimate parse to fail and thus is set to +nil+, or off, by default.
However, this results in a minor performance loss, and only works on platforms that support atomic file renames.
However, those can be customized:
However, unlink-before-close may not be supported on non-POSIX operating systems.
However, we can access instance variables with default value (nil).
However, we can't replace with each_with_object if the accumulator parameter is assigned to within the block.
However, when a layout is explicitly set, the explicitly set layout wins: * The InformationController uses the "information" layout, explicitly set.
However, when there is an error, the message is added to the password attribute instead so that the error message will make sense to the end-user.
However, while DBM only allows strings for both keys and values, this library allows one to use most Ruby objects for values by first converting them to YAML.
However, you can set these values manually in the target Encoding to avoid the translation.
However, you need to be aware when using +class_attribute+ with mutable structures as +Array+ or +Hash+.

I *think* they were just being defensive, but I have no idea.
I cheated by making the autotest parts not have ./
I did try to defer to the original interface whenever I didn't have a compelling reason to change it though, so hopefully this won't be too radically different.
I don't actually think it's possible to pass a Constraints object to this constructor, but there were multiple places that kept testing children of this object.
I don't know Ruby's spec about "unlink-before-close" exactly.
I don't think any of our existing classes are the right place though.
I have HOME, USERPROFILE and HOMEDRIVE + HOMEPATH.
I hope I can make more clean test on it.
I install "rdoc-3.12.gem", a package signed by "drbrain".
I looove users who give me unit tests.
I propose that it should fallback to USERPROFILE and HOMEDRIVE + HOMEPATH (at least on Win32).
I relax the rules in only one place and that is to make using this library easier.
I require to avoid warning more than once.
I strongly recommend this scheme.
I think it needs a big red disclaimer.
I think that it is not good on the supposed situation of using TkTextIO.

If the target is +nil+ and does not respond to the delegated method a +NoMethodError+ is raised, as with any other value.
If the template engine handles encodings, we send the encoded String to the engine without further processing.
If the template was not compiled yet, it is done exactly before rendering.
If the third is omitted then 0 (default interface) is used.
If the time deltas were processed first, the following datetimes would be advanced to 2010/04/01 instead.

If the upper components of the given time are broken or missing, they are supplied with those of +now+.
If the user accepts, the form is processed normally, otherwise no action is taken.
If the user accepts, the link is processed normally, otherwise no action is taken.
If the user didn't install the helper tools and installed Xcode in a non-conventional place, this is our only option.
If the user didn't specify an encoding, and the handler handles encodings, we simply pass the String as is to the handler (with the default_external tag)
If the user has asked for the gem to be installed in a directory that is the system gem directory, then use the system bin directory, else create (or use) a new bin dir under the gem_home.
If the user has explicitly decided to NOT raise errors, pass that option to I18n.
If the user installs Xcode-only, they have to approve the license or no "xc*" tool will work.

If the value is :schema_search_path (the default), any schemas listed in schema_search_path are dumped.
If the value is nil or false, application don't expects SCM_RIGHTS control message.
If the value type is REG_EXPAND_SZ, environment variables are replaced.
If the value type is REG_EXPAND_SZ, returns value data whose environment variables are replaced.
If the value type is neither REG_SZ, REG_MULTI_SZ, REG_DWORD, REG_DWORD_BIG_ENDIAN, nor REG_QWORD, TypeError is raised.
If the values type does not match, TypeError is raised.
If the various assert methods are not sufficient, then you may use this object to inspect the HTTP response in detail.
If the verb is not GET or POST, which are natively supported by HTML forms, the form will be set to POST and a hidden input called _method will carry the intended verb for the server to interpret.
If the verify_mode is not VERIFY_NONE and ca_file, ca_path and cert_store are not set then the system default certificate store is used.
If the write buffer is not empty, it is flushed at first.
If there are method calls chained to the right hand side of the assignment, we let rhs be the receiver of those method calls before we check if it's an if/unless/while/until.

If there are multiple hits for the search term, they are presented as a list with links.
If there are multiple proxies, that header may contain a list of IPs.
If there are multiple tap formulae with the name of ref, then ref is the canonical name
If there are no directly unresolved gems, then try and find +path+ in any gems that are available via the currently unresolved gems.
If there are no parentheses around the arguments, then braces and do-end have different meaning due to how they bind, so we allow either.
If there are no unresolved deps, then we can use just try normal require handle loading a gem from the rescue below.
If there are none to keep, returns nil.
If there are other threads or processes there is a race condition between both calls and it could be the case that you end up with two similar records.

If there is data in the cache with the given key, then that data is returned.
If there is data in the cache with the given keys, then that data is returned.
If there is no content type passed in via headers, and there are no attachments, or the message is multipart, then the default content type is used.
If there is no current server, this returns the default configuration.
If there is no known diff command or if it doesn't make sense to diff the output (single line, short output), then it simply returns a basic comparison between the two.
If there is no primary server currently running, it is a noop.
If there is no primary server then +server+ becomes the primary server.
If there is no proper proxy, nil is returned.

If there is no tranlsation messages for +message+ in locale, +message+ itself is returned.
If there is no value for +key+ and no block is given, returns +ifnone+.
If there is only one search hit, user is immediately redirected to the documentation for the particular gem, otherwise a list with results is shown.
If there is trailing whitespace, then that must be dealt with first.
If there will be no +:tablet+ variant declared, +:phone+ variant will be picked:
If there's a match, it sends the matched string to the handler associated with the FormatSpecifier.
If there's no .rubocop.yml there either, the path to the default file is returned.
If these cops try to autocorrect the same file at the same time, bad things are liable to happen
If these requires were at the top of the file the constant would not be defined by the time their files were loaded.
If they are both set, it means that either:
If they are not 0600 an error message is displayed and RubyGems aborts.
If they are not already present, the formula will probably fail :    to install.
If they do have such a constant, then this const_missing must be due to from_mod::const_name, which should not return constants from from_mod's parents.
If they don't, a MissingTagError will be raised.
If they haven't updated in 48 hours (172800 seconds), that might explain the error
If they want JavaScript, then it is an Ajax request and we render the JavaScript template associated with this action.
If this attribute is set to a non-default value, it will be included in the filename of the gem when it is built such as: nokogiri-1.6.0-x86-mingw32.gem

If this object always uses STARTTLS, returns :always.
If this object is passed as an argument to a method invoked over drb, then the wrapped object is passed instead.
If this object is the same object as the existing parent of this child, no action is taken.
If this object uses STARTTLS when the server support TLS, returns :auto.
If this offense is within a line range that is already being realigned by autocorrect, we report the offense without autocorrecting it.
If this option is not given, this subcommand uses the first handler that has the capability to read the image data.
If this option is not passed, the previous default value (if any) will be used.
If this routine sets up compression, then it does the decompression also, removing the header as well to prevent confusion.
If this test doesn't pass something may be very wrong.
If this value is `false` (the default), a ClientDisconnected exception will be raised.
If this value is `true`, calling `write` after the client disconnects will result in the written content being silently discarded.
If this value is false, the string may contain any characters, and REXML will escape any and all defined entities whose values are contained in the text.
If this value is nil (the default), then the raw value of the parent will be used as the raw value for this node.
If those elements are ActiveRecord::Base's, then this triggers the various method_missing's that we have, which significantly impacts upon performance.
If token Authorization header is present, call the login procedure with the present token and options.

If ver contains rc version, just ignored.
If want it to generate a generic certificate, the bare minimum is to provide the :SSLCertName
If we add it to the previous example:
If we are continuing a previous column
If we are inside a Rails application this method performs an exec and thus the rest of this script is not run.
If we are starting a new quoted column
If we call 'options' with it unset, we get double help banners.
If we can't create a directory due to a permission problem, then we will silently continue.
If we can't load psych, thats fine, go on.
If we delete Cellar/newname, then Cellar/oldname symlink can become broken and we have to remove it.
If we deleted one of a person's tasks, we would probably not want the project to be deleted.
If we exhaust the search there is no executable, this could be a call to generate a new application, so restore the original cwd.
If we find one, we'll encode the String in that encoding, otherwise, we'll use the default external encoding.
If we find the corresponding reference, generate a link.
If we get here a root directory is not an ascendant of path.
If we get here, it means that NoMethodError was not raised.
If we get no exception here, then either we re-connected successfully, or we never actually got disconnected.
If we got any syntax errors, return only the syntax offenses.
If we have a magic comment in the original migration, insert our comment after the first newline(end of the magic comment line) so the magic keep working.
If we later find a superclass for a registered class with a nil superclass, we must honor it.
If we needed a second item, we'd make another block with maker.items.new_item and build a second one.
If we replace the brace with a brace plus space (rather than just inserting a space), then any removal of the same brace will give us a clobbering error.
If we took a while to get the lock, we may have been halted in the meantime.
If we're being loaded after yaml was already required, then load our yaml + workarounds now.
If we're here then we haven't found among non-private methods but found among all methods.
If we're outputting to a pager, use bs, otherwise ansi.
If we're supposed to be using syck, then we may have to force activate it via the YAML::ENGINE API.
If wtype is specified, the value type is it.
If x2 and  y2 are specified, the source region will be replicated if necessary to fill the destination region in a tiled fashion.
If x2 and y2 are not specified, the default value is (x1,y1) plus the size of the source region (after subsampling and zooming, if specified).
If x2 and y2 are not specified, the default value is the bottom-right corner of the source image.
If y is not given, the default value is the same as x.
If you absolutely must write from within a function use +concat+.
If you access the same Tempfile object from multiple threads then you should protect it with a mutex.
If you add a method, keep in mind two things: (1) the first argument will always be a list of nodes from which to filter.
If you are behind multiple proxy servers (like NGINX to HAProxy to Unicorn) then you should test your Rack server to make sure your data is good.
If you are handling large files or wish to implement a progress bar you can instead stream the body directly to an IO.
If you are having to call this function, you are likely doing something wrong.
If you are migrating code from 1.8 or earlier, you may have to change your code to comply with the new interface.
If you are only performing a few GET requests you should try OpenURI.
If you are upgrading an existing Rails 3 app, you should leave your existing secret_token in place and simply add the new secret_key_base.
If you are using Unicorn with NGINX, you may need to tweak NGINX.
If you are using XHR requests other than GET or POST and redirecting after the request then some browsers will follow the redirect using the original request method.
If you are using a mounted engine and you need to use a polymorphic_url pointing at the engine's routes, pass in the engine's route proxy as the first argument to the method.
If you are using file uploads then you will also need to set the multipart option for the form tag:
If you are using inheritance with ActiveRecord and don't want child classes to utilize the implied STI table name of the parent class, this will need to be true.
If you are using jQuery with jquery-rails this happens automatically.
If you are writing new test code, please use MiniTest instead of Test::Unit.

If you build your documentation by hand run:
If you build your gem it will automatically be signed.
If you call a complicated SQL query which spans multiple tables the columns specified by the SELECT will be attributes of the model, whether or not they are columns of the corresponding table.
If you care about that, then you need to explicitly drop or ignore those headers sometime before this middleware runs.
If you care to define how to move up and down in these cases, you should define the +up+ and +down+ methods as before.
If you change use_ssl value after session started, a Net::HTTP object raises IOError.
If you choose to name the composition the same as the attribute's name, it will be the only way to access that attribute.
If you decide to define multiple applications, then the first application that is initialized will be set to +Rails.application+, unless you override it with a different application.
If you decide to define rake tasks, runners, or initializers in an application other than +Rails.application+, then you must run them manually.
If you did not install Ruby by hand you may need to install the documentation yourself.
If you discover an incorrect inflection and require it for your application or wish to define rules for languages other than English, please correct or add them yourself (explained below).
If you do not provide a +block+, it will return an Enumerator for chaining with other methods:
If you do not specify a default, PStore::Error will be raised if the object is not found.
If you do not want to use any test framework, you can do:
If you do pass a block, you can render specific templates of your choice:
If you do this, then Mail will take the file name and work out the mime type.
If you do this, you do not need to do anything else for things to "just work".
If you do, Rails will not try to encode the String into the default_internal, passing you the unaltered bytes tagged with the assumed encoding (from default_external).
If you don't explicitly unlink the temporary file, the removal will be delayed until the object is finalized.
If you don't have SSL certificates for each of the asset hosts this technique allows you to avoid warnings in the client about mixed media.
If you don't have a layout, just render the thing and concatenate the final result.
If you don't have a type column defined in your table, single-table inheritance won't be triggered.
If you don't have gettext gem, this method doesn't load .po file.
If you don't just want to parlay the broadcast unfiltered to the subscriber, you can also supply a callback that lets you alter what is sent out.
If you don't like this behavior you can provide a different directory but it must be on the same physical filesystem as the file you're trying to write.
If you don't specify a +:startdoc:+ by the end of the container, disables documentation for the rest of the current file.
If you don't specify a pattern then the default will be used.
If you don't specify an endpoint, routes will be used as the default endpoint.
If you don't use a proxy, because you are hosted on e.g. Heroku without SSL, any client can claim to have any IP address by setting the X-Forwarded-For header.
If you enable +ParamsWrapper+ for +:json+ format, instead of having to send JSON parameters like this:
If you feel that you need to inject dynamic values, then perhaps you should reexamine whether your application is properly testable.
If you file :    a bug report, you will likely be asked for this information if you do not :    provide it.
If you have a more-complex set of overrides you can use the :call-seq: directive: ++
If you have a nested route, such as +admin_workshop_path+ you'll have to call that explicitly (it's impossible for +url_for+ to guess that route).
If you have a stream that is related to a model, then the broadcasting used can be generated from the model and channel.
If you have a string in some other encoding, convert it first.
If you have an array of keys you want to limit to, you should splat them:
If you have any questions, file a ticket at http://bugs.ruby-lang.org.

If you have used a command-line FTP program, and are familiar with the commands, you will be able to use this class easily.
If you hold a reference to a user record, but the name is changed while that reference is held, you may be sending stale data if you don't take precautions to avoid it.
If you let it repeat then it will choose random start positions for each new tour.
If you look directly to the database you cannot assume that's the entire collection because new records may have been added to the target, etc.
If you maintain your own repository, you can add your own bottle links.
If you modify this collection please update the API of +permit+ above.
If you need RubyGems to perform extra work on install or uninstall, your defaults override file can set pre and post install and uninstall hooks.
If you need a float that big, something is wrong with you.

If you need to address multiple instances of the same class in the same view, you can prefix the dom_class:
If you need to address multiple instances of the same class in the same view, you can prefix the dom_id:
If you need to create the application database on another system, you should be using db:schema:load, not running all the migrations from scratch.
If you need to disable this for any reason (e.g. development) then you can use an +:if+ or +:unless+ condition.
If you need to disconnect a given connection, you can go through the RemoteConnections.
If you need to do more complex things with a default scope, you can alternatively define it as a class method:
If you need to keep values sorted in some order, use the SortedSet class.

If you need to redirect on the condition of something, then be sure to add "and return" to halt execution.
If you need to retrieve specifications from a different +source+, you can send it as an argument.
If you need to send attachments with no content, you need to create an empty view for it, or add an empty body parameter like this:
If you need to share the same extensions between many associations, you can use a named extension module.
If you need to use a MIME type which isn't supported by default, you can register your own handlers in +config/initializers/mime_types.rb+ as follows.
If you need to use dots as part of the +:id+ parameter add a constraint which overrides this restriction, e.g:
If you need to work on all current children, new and existing records, +load_target+ and the +loaded+ flag are your friends.
If you need unescaped contents, set this to false.
If you only have secret_token set, your cookies will be signed, but not encrypted.
If you override this method to handle additional cases, you may also provide a method (like _handle_method_missing) to handle the case.
If you pass a Symbol as the first argument, then a corresponding cache store class under the ActiveSupport::Cache namespace will be created.
If you pass a single Fixnum, returns a substring of one character at that position.

If you pass any additional configuration options, they will be passed to the class and available as +options+:
If you pass arguments to "yield" then this will be passed to the block.
If you peek inside your gem file, you'll see a couple of new files have been added:
If you perform a DDL operation, then any created savepoints will be automatically released.
If you provide a block that takes one argument, it will be passed the field and is expected to return the converted value or the field itself.
If you really need stdout and stderr output as separate strings, you can consider Open3.capture3.
If you set +with_directory+ to +false+, then the returned pathnames will contain the filename only.
If you set :use_ssl as true, you can use https and default value of verify_mode is set as OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_PEER.
If you specify a symbol, that attribute will be updated with the current time in addition to the updated_at/on attribute.
If you start poking around with the accessors, you can easily create a non-conformant Entity.
If you think what's below is wrong, please read RubyForge bug 2055, RFC 1738 section 3.2.2, and RFC 2396.
If you try to define a set of rake tasks on the instance, these will get passed up to the rake tasks defined on the application's class.
If you use IPv4 multicast then the interface of +interface_address+ is used as the inbound interface.
If you use IPv4 multicast you may need to set an address of the inbound interface which joins a multicast group.
If you use IPv6 multicast then +multicast_interface+ is used as the inbound interface.
If you use IPv6 multicast you may need to set both an address and the outbound interface index:
If you use IPv6 multicast you may need to set both the local interface address and the inbound interface index:
If you use `permit` with just the key that points to the nested attributes hash, it will return an empty hash.
If you use a helper method, for example, inside a cached block and you then update that helper, you'll have to bump the cache as well.
If you use the sections 'Public', 'Internal' and 'Deprecated' (the three allowed method statuses from TomDoc) the sections will be displayed in that order placing the most useful methods at the top.
If you use this option you need to make sure to reconnect any threads in the `on_worker_boot` block.
If you want a gem to behave as an engine, you have to specify an +Engine+ for it somewhere inside your plugin's +lib+ folder (similar to how we specify a +Railtie+):
If you want an overview of how RDoc works see CONTRIBUTING
If you want any other positioning, pass a preset StringIO object instead.

If you want to use both Forwardable and SingleForwardable, you can use methods def_instance_delegator and def_single_delegator, etc.
If you want to use encoding other than Base64 then you will need to pass encoding type along with the pre-encoded content as Mail doesn't know how to decode the data:
If you want to use the library to format text blocks into HTML or other formats, look at RDoc::Markup.
If you want to validate that a child record is associated with a parent record, you can use the +validates_presence_of+ method and the +:inverse_of+ key as this example illustrates:

If you wish to store your key in a separate secure location you'll need to set your gems up for signing by hand.
If you would like to duplicate functionality of `gem` commands, use the classes they call directly.
If you'd like to read someone's RSS feed with your Ruby code, you've come to the right place.
If you'd like to write your own Formatter use RDoc::Markup::FormatterTestCase.
If you'd prefer to use numeric prefixes, you can turn timestamped migrations off by setting:
If you're not going to be using any of the options like collections or layouts, you can also use the short-hand defaults of render to render partials.
If you're not streaming a broadcasting at the very moment it sends out an update, you will not get that update, even if you connect after it has been sent.
If you're on MySQL, then do not use DDL operations in nested transactions blocks that are emulated with savepoints.
If you're packaging RubyGems or implementing Ruby you can change RubyGems' defaults.
If you're using named routes, they can be easily tested using the original named routes' methods straight in the test case.
If you're writing a text-output formatter use RDoc::Markup::TextFormatterTestCase which provides extra test cases.
If you're writing code like this you're doing it wrong
If you've set specific values, they'll be left alone.
If your JSON is being used downstream for insertion into the DOM, be aware of whether or not it is being inserted via +html()+.
If your POP server provides UIDL functionality, you can grab only selected mails from the POP server.
If your Ruby is ruby18, foo_exec will be installed as foo_exec18.
If your block takes two arguments, it will also be passed a CSV::FieldInfo Struct, containing details about the field.
If your cache is on a shared infrastructure, you can define a namespace for your cache entries.
If your certificate is not self-signed (signed by a third party) RubyGems will attempt to load the certificate chain from the trusted certificates.
If your code is intended for general consumption, test with multiple database backends.
If your data cannot be transcoded to UTF-8 the conversion will fail and the field will remain unchanged.
If your data cannot be transcoded to UTF-8 the conversion will fail and the header will remain unchanged.
If your database supports setting the isolation level for a transaction, you can set it like so:
If your environment matches this description and you cannot authenticate, try this rule in your Apache setup:
If your method manually calls a block instead of yielding or you want to override the discovered argument names use the :yields: directive:
If your prefix is in a standard location (ie, rubygems is installed where you'd expect it to be), then prefix returns nil.
If your proxies aren't removed, pass them in via the +custom_proxies+ parameter.
If your railtie has Rake tasks, you can tell Rails to load them through the method +rake_tasks+:
If your remote-ip is Ruby/Tk, you can control the remote Ruby by 'ruby' or 'ruby_eval' or 'ruby_cmd' on the Tk interpreter.
If your resource has associations defined, for example, you want to add comments to the document given that the routes are set correctly:
If your tables share a common prefix, it will only appear once at the beginning.
If your template cache depends on multiple sources (try to avoid this to keep things simple), you can name all these dependencies as part of an array:
If your type has the same name as a native type for the current adapter, an exception will be raised unless you specify an +:override+ option.
If your type is only meant to be used with a specific database adapter, you can do so by passing +adapter: :postgresql+.
If your type returns an object which could be mutated, you should override this method.
IfUnlessModifier depends on the configuration of LineLength.

In Rails, a resourceful route provides a mapping between HTTP verbs and URLs and controller actions.
In Rails, this is usually achieved by creating the form using +form_for+ and a number of related helper methods.
In Ruby 2, source code encoding defaults to UTF-8.
In RubyGems 2 and newer there is no extra work to sign a gem.
In a chain of method calls, we regard the top send node as the base for indentation of all lines following the first.
In a controller, for example:
In a fat file, this changes install names in all internal Mach-Os.
In a few cases, the helper proxies to 'controller' or request.
In a great majority of cases, this is what is wanted.
In a happier world, this would be an attr_accessor.
In a multi-threaded environment they should only be set once at boot-time and never mutated at runtime.
In addition to a method's standard errors, a dRuby call may also raise one of the dRuby-specific errors, all of which are subclasses of DRb::DRbError.
In addition to its specific fields and methods, a Cookie instance is a delegator to the array of its values.
In addition to saving, it also destroys any associated records that were marked for destruction.
In addition to the CSV instance methods, several IO methods are delegated.
In addition to the Rake targets generated by Rake::PackageTask, a Gem::PackageTask will also generate the following tasks:
In addition to the basic accessors, query methods are also automatically available on the Active Record object.
In addition to the validators that ship with OptionParser (String, Integer, Float, TrueClass, FalseClass, Array, Regexp, Date, Time, URI, etc.), RDoc::Options adds Path, PathArray and Template.
In addition to these specific assertions, you also have easy access to various collections that the regular test/unit assertions can be used against.
In addition to using the standard template helpers provided, creating custom helpers to extract complicated logic or reusable functionality is strongly encouraged.
In addition to wrapping libyaml, Psych also knows how to serialize and de-serialize most Ruby objects to and from the YAML format.
In addition, RDoc assumes by default that the C method implementing a Ruby function is in the same source file as the rb_define_method call.
In addition, a thread to wait for the started process is created.
In addition, both must be a regular expression or a proc or lambda, or else an exception will be raised.
In addition, default connection parameters of libpq can be set per environment variables.
In addition, it will destroy the association if it was marked for destruction.
In addition, old downloads from the Homebrew download-cache are deleted.
In addition, parameters can be marked as required and flow through a predefined raise/rescue flow to end up as a 400 Bad Request with no effort.
In addition, the verbatim text has been shifted left, so the amount of indentation of verbatim text is unimportant.
In addition, this allows a single partial to be used to generate form inputs for both edit and create forms.
In all cases, we transcode the resulting String to the UTF-8.
In all transparent pixels the color will be replaced by the specified color.
In an autoloaded user.rb like this
In an isolated engine, the prefix will be omitted in url helpers and form fields, for convenience.
In any case the status flag is returned.
In any case, +preload_associations+ will preload the all associations records by flattening +records+.
In any case, all arguments (+*args+) will be passed to Tempfile.new.
In any case, all arguments (+*args+) will be treated as Tempfile.new.
In both cases, if an offset is negative, it is counted from the end of the string.
In both cases, nil is returned if there is no match.
In both instances, valid attribute keys are determined by the column names of the associated table -- hence you can't have attributes that aren't part of the table columns.
In bundler the require: option overrides the file to require during Bundler.require.
In case of any error while parsing data ParamsParser::ParseError is raised.
In case of nil parameter it sets the charset to utf-8.
In case the layout continues yielding, we need to resume the fiber until all yields are handled.
In case we get back a String from a handler that is not in BINARY or the default_internal, encode it to the default_internal
In case we're building docs in a background process, this method waits for that process to exit (or if it's already been reaped, or never happened, swallows the Errno::ECHILD error).
In case you don't trust RubyGems you can verify gem signatures manually:
In column mode, iteration will +yield+ two element tuples containing the column name and an Array of values for that column.
In concurrent programming, a monitor is an object or module intended to be used safely by more than one thread.
In contrast to the CyclomaticComplexity cop, this cop considers `else` nodes as adding complexity.
In contrast to the corresponding method without the +_async+ suffix, which use connect-alive (one connection for all requests).
In each of these cases, the named routes remain the same as if you did not use scope.
In either case the merge respects the semantics of indifferent access.
In either case, the attribute is found by matching the attribute name to the argument, and then removed.
In general uses of dlerror(3) should call it before use it.
In general, a debugger is used to find bugs in your program, which often means pausing execution and inspecting variables at some point in time.
In general, an existing record may either be updated with the new set of attribute values or be replaced by a wholly new record containing those values.
In general, this means that templates will be UTF-8 inside of Rails, regardless of the original source encoding.
In general, this mechanism should only be used alongside, rather than as a replacement for, a good firewall.
In general, this module should not be included on its own, as it is usually included by url_helpers (as in Rails.application.routes.url_helpers).
In installing mode certain restrictions are ignored such as ruby version mismatch checks.
In invalid cases, an error from the database is thrown.
In later release, this module becomes a class.
In many cases this is preferable to inheritance, which gives us the entire old interface, even if much of it isn't needed.
In many cases you will want to wrap the above in another helper, so you could do something like the following:
In mixed mode an index is assumed to be a row reference while anything else is assumed to be column access by headers.
In most cases such calls can be replaced with an explicit array creation.
In most cases, fetching large number of records can be performed efficiently using the ActiveRecord::Batches methods.
In most cases, this argument can be left out.
In no case is the order of any siblings disturbed.
In normal cases, this method returns the same name as it receives.
In offense message, we want to show the assignment LHS rather than the entire assignment
In older Ruby versions, ie.
In older RubyGems versions, the environment variable GEM_SKIP could be used to skip activation of specified gems, for example to test out changes that haven't been installed yet.
In order for both of these features to be specified independently, both an object name (represented by either a symbol or string) and the object itself can be passed to the method separately -
In order for the associations to work as expected, ensure that you store the base model for the STI models in the type column of the polymorphic association.
In order to be used by RDoc the parser needs to register the file extensions it can parse.
In order to benefit from streaming you would want to rewrite it as:
In order to change engine's priority you can use +config.railties_order+ in the main application.
In order to create your own custom inspector there are two things you should be aware of:
In order to customize the prompt, you can change the following Hash:
In order to deploy this code, we should be able to handle any unmasked tokens that we've issued without error.
In order to execute a command on your OS, you need to define it as a Shell method.
In order to override this behavior, take a look at the private method +read_attribute_for_serialization+.
In order to start signing your gems, you'll need to build a private key and a self-signed certificate.
In order to test those situations, it may be necessary to require another library for the duration of one spec
In order to use DatabaseTasks, a few config values need to be set.
In order to use any of the customized resolvers above in a Rails application, you just need to configure ActionController::Base.view_paths in an initializer, for example:
In order to use instantiated fixtures with preloaded data, set +self.pre_loaded_fixtures+ to true.
In order to use streaming, you will need to use a Ruby version that supports fibers (fibers are supported since version 1.9.2 of the main Ruby implementation).
In order to use these methods to access fixtured data within your testcases, you must specify one of the following in your ActiveSupport::TestCase-derived class:
In order to use this library, you must first require it:
In order to use this method you must first require the PP module:
In order to use this method, you must require expect:
In order to use this module, all you need is to implement view_renderer that returns an ActionView::Renderer object.
In order to work with ActionController, a Context must just include this module.
In other case, read English resource data and display English text.
In other cases, it won't match any style at all
In other words, associations which could also be represented as has_and_belongs_to_many associations.
In other words, if the Jaro distance is less than this value, JaroWinkler.distance returns the raw Jaro distance.
In other words, the perfect system will accept all compatible versions of the library and reject all incompatible versions.
In other words, the right side (description part) starts after +width+ columns.
In other words, we make the request so that it operates on a single entity's person.
In other words, we only want to resolve one symlink.
In our case, we're simply returning a String, so next we have the +:string_literal+ expression.
In previous versions of Ruby you would need to require 'net/https' to use HTTPS.
In rare circumstances you might need to access the mapping directly.
In rare instances, web servers or front proxies strip authorization headers before they reach your application.
In raw mode, special characters in text is not converted to or from entities.
In some cases, like a single table inheritance setup, you might have a bunch of explicit dependencies.
In some cases, the code under test will happen to match an alternative style.
In some cases, you may want to provide a boolean hook.
In strict mode, column.default should be nil.
In such a situation you must decide whether to leave that migration or rename the migration in the application and rerun copying migrations.
In such actions, you want to delay queries execution as much as you can.
In such cases, all you need to do is to call refresh passing in the view object.
In such cases, you don't want to do changes in places but use setters:
In tests you can simply pass the URL or named route to +get+ or +post+.
In that case it is preferable to either use +check_box_tag+ or to use hashes instead of arrays.
In that case, +options+ and the block will be used by create_table.
In that case, +type+ and +options+ will be used by add_column.
In that case, batch processing methods allow you to work with the records in batches, thereby greatly reducing memory consumption.
In that case, don't generate an error, just move on.
In that case, it'll work just like normal subclasses with no special magic for differentiating between them or reloading the right type with find.
In that case, the buffer will be grown until the message is not truncated.
In that case, the index'th child Element that has the supplied name will be returned.
In that case, we must force an "early" commit: we're about to freeze the headers, so this is our last chance.
In the Asset example, you'd need an +attachable_id+ integer column and an +attachable_type+ string column.
In the above block, a +FormBuilder+ object is yielded as the +person_form+ variable.
In the above case, because the controller was explicitly given, but no action, the action is implied to be "index", not the recalled action of "show".
In the above example posts with no approved comments are not returned at all, because the conditions apply to the SQL statement as a whole and not just to the association.
In the above example, the configuration from the first application was used to initialize the second application.
In the authentication filter:
In the case of a belongs_to relationship, an association key can be used to specify the model if an ActiveRecord object is used as the value.
In the case of context methods (such as position), the function should return an array with a value for each child in the array.
In the case of rb_define_const, the definition and comment are in "/* definition: comment */" form.
In the case of the example above, the template would be fed +ad_iteration+.
In the context of execution taking place within the main thread of a dRuby server (typically, as a result of a remote call on the server or one of its objects), the current server is that server.
In the default mixed mode indices refer to rows and everything else is assumed to be a column header.
In the default mixed mode or row mode, iteration is the standard row major walking of rows.
In the default mixed mode, this method assigns rows for index access and columns for header access.
In the default mixed mode, this method returns rows for index access and columns for header access.
In the dynamically generated methods below, a call to `super` is used to continue iterating over the children of a node.
In the end it appends the regular report data in the clang style format.
In the event the specified _name_ is not found in the data store, your _default_ will be returned instead.
In the example above +render+ is the name of the event, and the rest is called the _payload_.
In the example above, if the format is xml, it will render:
In the examples above, the object to be created or edited was represented by a symbol passed to +form_for+, and we noted that a string can also be used equivalently.
In the following example the Post model has many Comments stored within it in a NoSQL database, thus there is no primary key for comments.
In the following example, the looping on users will always be done when the three columns 'first_name', 'last_name' and 'full_name' exist, even when migrating down:
In the former form, the temporary file's base name will begin with the given string.
In the future, this might become an optional require.
In the last case only, we continue.
In the last case, the following paths map to +PostsController+:
In the latter form, the temporary file's base name will begin with the array's first element, and end with the second element.
In the meantime that first process will go ahead and will write into cache the new value.
In the methods below:
In the normal case the loop is only executed once.
In the opposite direction, when using Psych.dump, the Ruby object graph is translated to an intermediary AST which is then converted to a YAML document.
In the previous example, +s+ would take you inside the method definition of +get_foo+.
In the prompt specification, some special strings are available:
In the rare case that a race condition occurs, the database will guarantee the field's uniqueness.
In the rare situation when the user has indeed a downcased and an upcased dir (e.g. /TMP and /tmp) this check falsely thinks it is case-insensitive but we don't care because: 1.
In the simple case, MySQL allows us to place JOINs directly into the UPDATE query.
In these cases, the opened file object is extended by OpenURI::Meta.
In these cases, the variable `foo` is not explicitly referenced, but it can be considered used implicitly by the `super` or `binding`.
In these cases, you can mix ERB in with your YAML fixtures to create a bunch of fixtures for load testing, like:
In these examples, we have three implicit lookup scenarios: * The BankController uses the "bank" layout.
In this case "kind" is "before" and "name" is "save".
In this case +last_modified+ will be set by calling +maximum(:updated_at)+ on the collection (the timestamp of the most recently updated record) and the +etag+ by passing the object itself.
In this case +last_modified+ will be set by calling +updated_at+ and +etag+ by passing the object itself.
In this case Rails will simply infer the appropriate URL from the record itself.
In this case it deletes all the entries in the specified file store directory except for .keep or .gitkeep.
In this case it is usually more natural to include an association which has conditions defined on it:
In this case the hash maps a pattern to the attribute character
In this case, Dir.mktmpdir doesn't remove the directory.
In this case, alias is called with "ponies".
In this case, if you use this:
In this case, make sure you return a String from your handler encoded in the default_internal.
In this case, options are specified as an array of values as described above, with the hash key of "VALUES".
In this case, recvmsg closes the passed file descriptors immediately.
In this case, the ancestor that has no parent acts as the root node.
In this case, the next Text child becomes the first Text child.
In this case, the read(2) system call is not called.
In this case, the return value of this method is the return value of the block.
In this case, there must be a +type+ column in the posts table.
In this case, you can use a singular resource to map /profile (rather than /profile/:id) to the show action.
In this case, you can use a singular resource to map /profile (rather than /profile/:id) to the show action:
In this context +:kind+ and +:name+ have special meanings: +:kind+ refers to the kind of callback (before/after/around) and +:name+ refers to the method on which callbacks are being defined.
In this context, 'Unicode Encoding' means any of  UTF-8, UTF-16BE/LE, and UTF-32BE/LE, as well as GB18030, UCS_2BE, and UCS_4BE.
In this description, 'association name' shall refer to the name passed to an association creation method.
In this example archived articles are not being taken into consideration when validating uniqueness of the title attribute:
In this example we used the literal shortcut for Array.new.
In this example we will create three +tmpFile+'s in three different folders under the +/tmp+ directory.
In this example we will read the operating system file +/etc/printcap+, generated by +cupsd+, and then output it to a new file relative to the +pwd+ of +sh+.
In this example, if any before validate callbacks returns +false+, any successive before and around callback is not executed.
In this example, it'd be interesting to move to the next line and inspect the value of +foo+ again.
In this example, the :iphone format will be used if it's available, otherwise it'll fallback to the :html format.
In this example, the auto-correction (changing "fail" to "raise") creates a new problem (alignment of parameters), which is also corrected automatically.
In this form, the PR may be on homebrew/brew, homebrew/core, or any tap.
In this implementation this occurs when the starting square is d6.
In this mode, it reads its parameters from the command line or (failing that) from standard input.
In this respect they are analogs of ActionDispatch::Callback's before and after callbacks.
In this scenario, the delete method won't actually work: it can only be used if the association on the join model is a belongs_to.
In this usage, the argument passed to the block (+format+ above) is an instance of the ActionController::MimeResponds::Collector class.
In this way the server can limit the time of the nonce's validity.
In those cases, we'll set up a simple mock
In those cases, you can resort to named bind variables instead.
In verbatim text, two or more blank lines are collapsed into one, and trailing blank lines are removed:
In verbose mode, failed calls are logged to stdout.
In which case we should just eager load them.
In which case, define them below.
In your ERB templates, use this method to escape any unsafe content.
In your integration tests, you can do something like this:
In-memory session storage class.
Include +obj+ in the objects to be pretty printed, and increment this Text object's total width by +width+
Include any trailing whitespace so we don't create a syntax error.
Include in a cookie jar to allow chaining, e.g. cookies.permanent.signed
Include the default authenticity_token, which is only generated when its set to nil, but we needed the true value to override the default of no authenticity_token on data-remote.
Include this module in a RDoc::Parser subclass to make it show up as a file, not as part of a class or module.
Include user ID in the path to make sure the user has write access.

Indeed it would be prettier to do this in PostgreSQLColumn.string_to_decimal but would break form input fields that call value_before_type_cast.
Indentation for summary.
Indentation indicates inheritance.
Indents the lines in the receiver:
Indexes are appended for any more successive uses of the table name.

Indicates if the model is persisted.
Indicates that this formula supports bottles.
Indicates that we should not try to update any deps unless we absolutely must.

Individual architectures in a fat binary can link to different subsets of libraries, but at this point we want to have the full picture, i.e. the union of all libraries used by all architectures.
Individual cache implementations may support additional options.
Individual switch class.
Inflections are locale specific, and you may define rules for as many different locales as you wish.

Installing MacGPG2 interferes with Homebrew in a big way https://github.com/GPGTools/MacGPG2
Installs alias methods for the default irb commands, see ::install_extend_commands.
Installs the default context extensions as irb commands:
Installs the default irb commands:
Installs the relocation tools (as provided by the cctools formula) as a hard dependency for every formula installed from a bottle when the user has no developer tools.
Instances may overwrite the class value in the same way:
Instances of this type are typically created and returned by methods in database adapters.
Instantiate a new mailer object.
Instantiate fixtures for every test if requested.
Instantiate the generator.
Instantiates a new column for the table.
Instantiates a new column in the table.
Instantiates objects for all attribute classes that needs more than one constructor parameter.
Instantiates the controller, then executes the action named +name+.
Instead of declaring separate routes for your +index+, +show+, +new+, +edit+, +create+, +update+ and +destroy+ actions, a resourceful route declares them in a single line of code:
Instead of editing this file, please use the migrations feature of Active Record to incrementally modify your database, and then regenerate this schema definition.
Instead of explicitly naming the location of a partial, you can also let PartialRenderer do the work and pick the proper path by checking `to_partial_path` method.
Instead of looking up the complete data each time we need it, we'll just look it up here and assign.
Instead of passing the content as an argument, you can also use a block in which case, you pass your +html_options+ as the first parameter.
Instead of passing the content as an argument, you can also use a block in which case, you pass your +options+ as the second parameter.
Instead of periodically breaking their monkeypatches let's add some hooks that we can query to allow their own behaviour.
Instead of polluting the thread locals namespace:
Instead of rescuing from this class, make sure to rescue from the superclass Gem::LoadError to catch all types of load errors.
Instead of writing every template out, you can use a wildcard to match any template in a directory:
Instead use methods +local+, +parse+, +at+ and +now+ on TimeZone instances, and +in_time_zone+ on Time and DateTime instances.
Instead, Action Cable operates through a remote-procedure call model.
Instead, a second model object is created when the create request is received.
Instead, it waits until it's called in a later stage of the execution.
Instead, pass a path object to `Gem::Package.new`.
Instead, pass an IO object to `Gem::Package.new`.
Instead, use RemoteConnections for that.
Instead, use the header to tell browsers to expire HSTS immediately.
Instead, you provide the names and values manually.
Instead, you should simply use +articles_path+, like you would do with your main application.
Instead, you should use one of its subclasses: Net::HTTP::Get, Net::HTTP::Post, Net::HTTP::Head.

It was set in setup_build_environment, so we have to restore it here.
It will affect the priority of loading views, helpers, assets and all the other files related to engine or application.
It will also invoke the db:schema:dump task, which will update your db/schema.rb file to match the structure of your database.
It will also set the Content-Type, Content-Disposition, Content-Transfer-Encoding and encode the contents of the attachment in Base64.
It will auto resolve formula's spec when requested spec is nil

It works line-by-line.
It yields Pathname object for each child.
It's OK if the user does not have the psych gem installed.
It's a string for backwards (RubyGems 1.3.5 and earlier) compatibility.
It's a way to redirect incoming requests to controllers and actions.
It's a wildcard match that we use for `respond_to` negotiation internals.
It's also a good idea to add indexes to each of those columns to speed up the joins process.
It's also important to note that while all of CSV's core parser is now Encoding agnostic, some features are not.
It's also important to treat the value objects as immutable.
It's also possible to construct multi-dimensional parameter hashes by specifying keys using brackets, such as:
It's also possible to delegate a method to the class by using +:class+:
It's also possible to pass a String instead of an options hash, which generates an anchor element that uses the value of the String as the href for the link.
It's also possible to specify the instance to be used:
It's automatically configured.
It's because HTTP_PROXY may be set by Proxy: header.
It's called when the canvas is initially created, and also whenever any of the parameters of the arrow head are changed interactively.
It's common to have resources that are logically children of other resources:
It's definitely a bug.
It's difficult to imagine that anybody would want empty lines around a method body, so we don't make it configurable.
It's especially important that they set the platform attribute appropriately.
It's even possible to call these dynamic finder methods on relations and named scopes.
It's extremely important to run the syntax check in a clean environment - otherwise it will be extremely slow.
It's implemented as a cop in that it inherits from the Cop base class and calls add_offense.
It's important to note that this does *not* cause SimpleDelegator's methods to change.
It's important to note that this will essentially merge any of the keys in +pairs+ with the existing +section+.
It's impossible for a method call without parentheses to have a trailing comma.
It's initially stuck on the outer share lock, but as soon as that's released, it can run -- regardless of whether those threads hold share locks.
It's intended that +method+ returns an integer and if that integer is above zero, then the checkbox is checked.
It's just an alternative to if/elsif/elsif...
It's just too hard for me to support native conversions in all of Ruby's Encodings.
It's like a simple key/value store baked into your record when you don't care about being able to query that store outside the context of a single record.
It's much better to swap that:
It's much like the standard library PrettyPrint, that shows the value of each expression as it runs.
It's not possible to derive all render calls like that, though.
It's not possible to halt the validate callback chain.
It's optional and there can be more than one.
It's possible to set the fixture's model class directly in the YAML file.
It's possible to stack callbacks by passing them as an array.
It's pretty safe to assume that these calls are not missed by anyone reading code.
It's probably easier to just use the constructor though, since calling this method requires the setup of an ERB _compiler_ object.
It's purely an online queue, though.
It's really easy to do this, but we'll need the help of open-uri:
It's recommended to first ::escape the provided +uri_str+ if there are any invalid URI characters.
It's required for package names to find the themes in demos/themes/*.tcl
It's said that all X-Forwarded-* headers will contain more than one (comma-separated) value if the original request already contained one of these headers.
It's simply information for the user.
It's slightly strange.
It's still possible to use both the stand-alone FormHelper methods and methods from FormTagHelper.
It's strange if interpolation syntax appears inside a static string, but we can't be sure if it's a mistake or not.
It's strongly recommended that you check this file into your version control system.
It's strongly recommended that you do this if you do not want any other processes to be able to read from or write to the Tempfile, and you do not need to know the Tempfile's filename either.
It's technically possible for a fat Mach-O to have over 30 architectures, but this is extremely unlikely and in practice distinguishes the two formats.
It's the extra spaces between the keys and values in a hash, since those are handled by the Style/AlignHash cop.
It's the same as Thor default except that the Generator at the end of the class is removed.
It's up to subclasses to implement the stale_state method if relevant.
It's used as the default entry point for generate, destroy and update commands.
It's usually too much work to keep it all synchronized -- something databases already excel at.
It's well-suited for dev/test since it doesn't need an external infrastructure, but it's a poor fit for production since it drops pending jobs on restart.

Like +merge+ but the other way around: Merges the receiver into the argument and returns a new hash with indifferent access as result:
Like +titleize+, this is meant for creating pretty output.
Like ::system, ri data in the user's home directory is rare and predates libraries distributed via RubyGems.

MessageEncryptor is a simple way to encrypt values which get stored somewhere you don't trust.
Messages are written to files named 'inbox/1', 'inbox/2', ....

Messages have two sorts of identifiers: message sequence numbers and UIDs.
Metadata items have the following restrictions:

Methods used by multiple fixtures should be defined in a module that is included in ActiveRecord::FixtureSet.context_class.
Methods which would normally return a String object now return a Chars object so methods can be chained.
Methods will be added for retrieval and query for a single associated object, for which this object holds an id:
Microsoft Windows is the most notable case: unlinking a non-closed file will result in an error, which this method will silently ignore.
Mid level is access to the raw YAML AST, and at the highest level is the ability to unmarshal YAML to Ruby objects.
Middleware class can be inserted as a Rack handler to be local cache for the duration of request.
Middleware like session, flash, cookies can be added back manually.
MiddlewareStackProxy is a proxy for the Rails middleware stack that allows you to configure middlewares in your application.
Middlewares can also be completely swapped out and replaced with others:
Middlewares that need to manipulate the body won't work with streaming.
Might want a shorter timeout depending on whether the request is a PATCH, PUT, or POST, and if the client is a browser or web service.
MigrationProxy is used to defer loading of the actual migration classes until they are needed
Migrations are currently supported in MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQL Server, and Oracle (all supported databases except DB2).
Migrations can manage the evolution of a schema used by several physical databases.

MySQL uses an implicit default 0 rather than NULL unless in strict mode.
Mysql floats are precision 0..24, Mysql doubles are precision 25..53

NOTE - for now, we're only supporting inverse setting from belongs_to back onto has_one associations.
NOTE - not sure that we can actually cope with inverses here
NOTE - the following 4 tables are used by models that have :inverse_of options on the associations
NOTE - these tests might not be meaningful, ripped as they were from the parental_control plugin which would guess the inverse rather than look for an explicit configuration option.

NOTE: It's not possible to set the order.
NOTE: Only the option tags are returned, you have to wrap this call in a regular HTML select tag.

Nested NoMethodError is a different name from the delegation
Nested NoMethodError is the same name as the delegation
Nested attribute writers are normal setter methods named after an association.
Nested attributes allow you to save attributes on associated records through the parent.
Nested attributes for an associated collection can also be passed in the form of a hash of hashes instead of an array of hashes:
Nested classes are given table names prefixed by the singular form of the parent's table name.
Nested classes are prefixed with singular parent table name.
Nested elements yield an +AtomBuilder+ instance.
Nested hash conditions with different keys
Nested hash conditions with same keys
Nested resources and/or namespaces are also supported, as illustrated in the example:

Normally no ri data is stored here.
Normally that means incrementing the build number.
Normally the unique-id is a hash of the message.
Normally the unique-id is a hash string of the message.
Normally they should be aligned with an if/unless/while/until/begin/def keyword, but there are special cases when they should follow the same rules as the alignment of end.
Normally this is +nil+.
Normally we don't want whitespace errors, but squashing them can break patches so an option is provided to skip this step.
Normally we've already committed by now, but it's possible (e.g., if the controller action tries to read back its own response) to get here before that.

Not a one-liner, so this is an offense.
Not aligned according to `indent` or `outdent` style:
Not all cases can reliably checked, due to Ruby's dynamic types, so we consider only cases when the first argument is an array literal or the second is a string literal.
Not all migrations change the schema.
Not all records have the same class, so group then preload group on the reflection itself so that if various subclass share the same association then we do not split them unnecessarily
Not all web servers support streaming out-of-the-box.
Not for general consumption.
Not good enough, but we can't do much about it since there is no specific error for frozen objects.

Not important to the user.
Not necessary for this small example, but will be required as soon as we pass a non-marshallable object as an argument to a dRuby call.
Not surprisingly, these delimiters look like HTML markup.
Not this cop's job to fix end.
Not used in core, used in taps.
Notations in the external DTD subset are not listed.
Note about replacing already defined headers:
Note again that the indexes start at 1.
Note also that because of backwards compatibility (loading new gems in an old RubyGems installation), we can't add explicit marshaling to this class until we want to make a big break.
Note also that destroying a record preserves its ID in the model instance, so deleted models are still comparable.
Note an object is not required to implement all APIs in order to work with Action Pack.
Note downloads for any installed formulae will still not be :    deleted.
Note in particular that by default the FileStore and PStore session data files have the same name.
Note that +:controller+, +:action+ and +:id+ are interpreted as url query parameters and thus available through +params+ in an action.
Note that +cmd+ is a server command (such as "RETR myfile").
Note that +touch+ must be used on a persisted object, or else an ActiveRecordError will be thrown.

Note that all values in the hash will be Strings, but the keys will be actual objects.
Note that anything marked as an identifier will automatically create a delegate by the same name on any channel instances created off the connection.
Note that because +delete_all+ removes records by directly running an SQL query into the database, the +updated_at+ column of the object is not changed.
Note that binding must enclose the io you wish to output on.
Note that building your own string from user input may expose your application to injection attacks if not done properly.
Note that by default, the :method: directive will be ignored if there is a standard rdocable item following it.
Note that capitalized variables (HTTP_PROXY, FTP_PROXY, NO_PROXY, etc.) are examined too.
Note that content_for concatenates (default) the blocks it is given for a particular identifier in order.
Note that declaring a header multiple times will add many fields of the same name.
Note that dir_config only adds to the list of places to search for libraries and include files.
Note that each possible HTTP response code defines its own HTTPResponse subclass.
Note that env and opts are optional, as Process.spawn.
Note that env and opts are optional, as for Process.spawn.

Note that find_files will return all files even if they are from different versions of the same gem.
Note that if +line+ contains multiple rows, anything beyond the first row is ignored.
Note that if some blank-like object were initially passed into the query method, then this method will not raise an error.
Note that if the target has not been loaded, it is not considered stale.
Note that if the user has JavaScript disabled, the request will fall back to using GET.
Note that if you are really concerned about your application security, you might consider using +config.force_ssl+ in your config file instead.
Note that if you are working on a guide generation will by default process only that one, so ONLY is rarely used nowadays.
Note that if you do not specify the +:inverse_of+ option, then Active Record will try to automatically guess the inverse association based on heuristics.
Note that if you return a path without a leading slash then the url is prefixed with the current SCRIPT_NAME environment variable.
Note that if you use +permit+ in a key that points to a hash, it won't allow all the hash.
Note that in this case, the returned response object will *not* contain a (meaningful) body.
Note that it also means that associations marked for destruction won't be destroyed directly.
Note that it always returns +true+ with boolean attributes.
Note that it handles both ASCII and Unicode whitespace.
Note that it is not widely implemented and should be set to zero.
Note that it may accept connections too much.
Note that it still rejects incorrectly-padded input.
Note that keys are treated differently than HashWithIndifferentAccess, meaning that string and symbol keys will not match.
Note that magic comments must be at the first line(except sh-bang).
Note that marking a constant for unloading need only be done once.
Note that meanwhile the class Pet is not reloaded, simulating a class that is present in a plugin.
Note that new records are different from any other record by definition, unless the other record is the receiver itself.
Note that now there can be more than one router in your application, and it's better to avoid passing requests through many routers.
Note that one reason that read_nonblock writes to the underlying IO is when the peer requests a new TLS/SSL handshake.
Note that one reason that write_nonblock reads from the underlying IO is when the peer requests a new TLS/SSL handshake.
Note that partials are not supported to be rendered with streaming, so in such cases, we just wrap them in an array.
Note that passing custom disallowed types will override the default types, which are Symbol and YAML.
Note that setting the UUID primary key default value to +nil+ will require you to assure that you always provide a UUID value before saving a record (as primary keys cannot be +nil+).
Note that some of its interface is available directly.
Note that some of the migrations may be skipped if a migration with the same name already exists in application.
Note that the +:limit+ option is only applicable to one-to-many associations.
Note that the +do end+ syntax for the redirect block wouldn't work, as Ruby would pass the block to +get+ instead of +redirect+.
Note that the Ruby URI library allows HTTP URLs containing usernames and passwords.
Note that the active mode is default in Ruby 1.8 or prior.
Note that the association_scope is merged into the target_scope only when the scope method is called.
Note that the content doesn't really matter
Note that the contract between publisher and subscriber (observable and observer) is not declared or enforced.
Note that the md5 is taken of the entire template file, not just what's within the cache do/end call.
Note that the model is _not_ yet removed from the database:
Note that the model will _not_ be destroyed until the parent is saved.
Note that the proxy server is not a *real* proxy server.
Note that the redirects are followed until the response is not a redirect--this means you may run into an infinite loop if your redirect loops back to itself.
Note that the request method is not verified.
Note that the request parameter might not be supplied, e.g. when the assets are precompiled via a Rake task.
Note that the result is always UTC (GMT).
Note that the result is not copied.
Note that the results never contain the entries +.+ and +..+ in the directory because they are not children.
Note that the return value of validation methods is not relevant.
Note that the rules which can derive empty and non-empty sequences are modified to derive only non-empty sequences.
Note that the selection of functions is similar, but not identical, to that in module math.
Note that the session's data is _not_ automatically deleted upon the session expiring.
Note that the status code must be a 3xx HTTP code, or redirection will not occur.
Note that the trailing space is intentional
Note that the usec for the time passed will be set to 0 to prevent rounding errors with external services, like MySQL (which will round instead of floor, leading to off-by-one-second errors).
Note that the validator is initialized only once for the whole application life cycle, and not on each validation run.
Note that these are implemented as callbacks, and Rails executes callbacks in order.
Note that these expressions are meant to pick up text for which cross-references have been suppressed, since the suppression characters are removed by the code that is triggered.
Note that these methods do not strictly require +Post+ to be a subclass of ActiveRecord::Base.
Note that these tests must be executed in order for the third one to actually test anything.
Note that this conversion makes some assumptions about the duration of some periods, e.g. months are always 30 days and years are 365.25 days:
Note that this doesn't attempt to distinguish between libstdc++ versions, for instance between Apple libstdc++ and GNU libstdc++
Note that this doesn't guarantee to write all data in string.
Note that this is a "shallow" copy as it copies the object's attributes only, not its associations.
Note that this is a naive implementation because we could have strings and symbols which represent the same association, but that aren't matched by this.
Note that this is currently not recommended since it breaks caching.
Note that this is not just a usage suggestion.
Note that this is not the same as the document element.
Note that this is only useful if the original XML is not already formatted.
Note that this is simply 'syntactic sugar' for defining an actual class method:
Note that this method actually runs the queries, since the results of some are needed by the next ones when eager loading is going on.
Note that this method does not actually affect the generated Makefile.
Note that this method is identical to readpartial except the non-blocking flag is set.
Note that this method must be called before header rows are read to have any effect.
Note that this method removes records from the database ignoring the +:dependent+ option.
Note that this operation instantly fires update SQL without waiting for the save or update call on the parent object, unless the parent object is a new record.
Note that this returns a string and not a class.
Note that this schema.rb definition is the authoritative source for your database schema.
Note that this setting will not skip rows that contain column separators, even if the rows contain no actual data.
Note that this tolerance only matters if the exception was given as a string, otherwise a NameError will be raised by the interpreter itself when rescue_from CONSTANT is executed.
Note that this will clear anything that is being used to validate the model for both the +validates_with+ and +validate+ methods.
Note that this will probably never be used
Note that this will unsubscribe all subscriptions with the given name:
Note that unlike reorder, we're only unscoping the named conditions -- not the entire where statement.
Note that using conditions like this can have unintended consequences.
Note that we are including a 30-second boundary around the interval we want to test.
Note that we don't actually need to serialize the jobs since we're performing them in-process, but we do so anyway for parity with other adapters and deployment environments.
Note that when an array is used, the implicit mapping from the values to database integers is derived from the order the values appear in the array.
Note that when options are passed in, you must call +objectify_options+ in order for the model object to get correctly passed to the method.
Note that you can't use HAVING without also specifying a GROUP clause.
Note the filename is not stored.
Note the subtle difference between the two: +assert_routing+ tests that a URL fits options while +assert_recognizes+ tests that a URL breaks into parameters properly.
Note this method does not imply the records are actually removed from the database, that depends precisely on +delete_records+.
Note, all the attributes for all the cases are kept in the same table.
Note, however, that GetoptLong is a pure Ruby implementation.
Note, however, that this is not a command line parser.
Note, however, the extra bit at the top of that action:
Note, that different ways to install the CLTs lead to different version numbers.
Note, that this is not your usual scan() method.
Note, that you have to use Thread to call these methods concurrently.
Note, with using explicit self you can only send messages with public or protected scope, you cannot send private messages this way.
Note: +:id+ is always present.
Note: Acronyms that are passed to +pluralize+ will no longer be recognized, since the acronym will not occur as a delimited unit in the pluralized result.
Note: Fixtures are unordered.
Note: How end-of-line comments are associated with code changed in parser-2.2.0.4.
Note: If the day is not included as an option but the month is, the day will be set to the 1st to ensure that all month choices are valid.
Note: Inherited methods from class Object cannot be used as XML-RPC names, because they get around +method_missing+.
Note: Instantiation, callback execution, and deletion of each record can be time consuming when you're removing many records at once.
Note: It is possible for this value to match multiple options as you might have the same option in multiple groups.
Note: Joining, eager loading and preloading of these associations is not fully possible.
Note: MySQL doesn't yet support index order (it accepts the syntax but ignores it).
Note: No Lint/UselessAssignment offense.
Note: Partial indexes are only supported for PostgreSQL and SQLite 3.8.0+.
Note: Regexp expiration is only supported on caches that can iterate over all keys (unlike memcached).
Note: Rinda::Ring API is unstable.
Note: SQLite doesn't support index length.
Note: SSEs are not currently supported by IE.
Note: The new instance will share a link to the same attributes as the original class.
Note: The old instance's sti column value will be changed too, as both objects share the same set of attributes.
Note: The path passed to `--require` is directly passed to `Kernel.require`.
Note: The precision is the total number of significant digits and the scale is the number of digits that can be stored following the decimal point.
Note: This assertion is simply a shortcut for:
Note: This is purely a browser performance optimization and is not meant for server load balancing.
Note: Updating a large number of records will run an UPDATE query for each record, which may cause a performance issue.
Note: You can also use Rails' i18n functionality for this.
Note: `raise_error` refers to us re-raising the error in this method.
Note: always returns false if '0'.
Note: depending on your database connector, the result returned by this method may be manually memory managed.
Note: don't support ttk_wrapper.
Note: klass will always be valid because when there's a NameError from calling +klass+, +reflection+ will already be set to false.
Note: no need to specialize private_methods, since they are not forwarded
Note: only check homepages that are repo pages, not *.github.com hosts
Note: only supported by MySQL.
Note: only supported by PostgreSQL and MySQL
Note: parser.rb is LGPL, but your parser is not.
Note: please adjust paths accordingly use for example 'locate yaml.rb' and 'gem environment' to identify directories, that are specific for your local installation
Note: there isn't a std_autotools variant because autotools is a lot less consistent and the standard parameters are more memorable.
Note: this does not capture all cases, for example it would be crazy to try to properly support stale-checking for nested associations.
Note: this is almost the same as valparse, except that it does not accept atomic values.
Note: this must be called at least once per process to take any effect.
Note: title should be shifted up - distinguish a separate title area
Note: we assume that the size of intptr_t and uintptr_t equals to the size of real pointer.
Note: when using +controller+, the route is simply named after the method you call on the block parameter rather than map.
Notebook demonstration:
Nothing is said about existing indentation that mixes spaces and tabs, so there is nothing to test.
Nothing more, nothing less.
Nothing we can do if we are in a transaction because all commands will raise InFailedSQLTransaction
Nothing will be appended to the errors object.
Notice that "rails:generators:test_unit" could be loaded as well, what Rails looks for is the first and last parts of the namespace.
Notice that "rails:generators:webrat" could be loaded as well, what Rails looks for is the first and last parts of the namespace.
Notice that :stream only works with templates.
Notice that blank lines right after the label are ignored in labeled lists:
Notice that events get sent even if an error occurs in the passed-in block.
Notice that for fixnum and float columns empty strings are converted to +nil+.
Notice that no +:id+ parameter was provided to the first +url_for+ call and the helper used the one from the route's path.
Notice that the first argument is the method to be dispatched which is *not* necessarily the same as the action name.
Notice that we use a bang in this instrumentation because you don't want to consume this in production.
Notice that when you add a path using +add+, the path object created already contains the path with the same path value given to +add+.
Notice the 97.18 as a float is greater than 97.18 as a BigDecimal due to floating point precision
Notice the need in this example to provide a special binding when the template is run, so that the instance variables in the Product object can be resolved.
Notice this method raises an error if the template to be refreshed does not have a virtual path set (true just for inline templates).
Notice this method takes into consideration the default root path.
Notifications ships with a queue implementation that consumes and publishes events to all log subscribers.
Notifications will be sent only if the changed +state+ is +true+.
Notifier.welcome(User.first).deliver_later Notifier.welcome(User.first).deliver_later(wait: 1.hour) Notifier.welcome(User.first).deliver_later(wait_until: 10.hours.from_now)
Notifier.welcome(User.first).deliver_now
Notifies observers of a change in state.
Notify observers of a change in state *if* this object's changed state is +true+.
Now RubyGems defers to -I and the RUBYLIB environment variable to skip activation of a gem.
Now all you have to do is change that timestamp when the helper method changes.
Now autoload handles this.
Now contains DecimalInteger, OctalInteger and DecimalNumeric.
Now it _is_ removed from the database:
Now it's possible to access attributes from the database through the value objects instead.
Now let's verify the signature.
Now put the values back in our globals
Now reload, and verify that it gets the DB version, and not the querycache version
Now routes such as +/posts/1+ will no longer be valid, but +/posts/1.1+ will be.
Now that we're sure some kind of yaml library is loaded, pull in our hack to deal with Syck's DefaultKey ugliness.
Now that we've got Syck setup in all the right places, store a reference to the DefaultKey class inside Gem.
Now the Date class can be loaded in addition to the classes listed above.
Now update the timestamp.
Now use the Rails insertion
Now verify it's identical to a JSON round trip.
Now we are going to change the template, but it won't change the returned template since the timestamp is the same.
Now we are going to change the template, but it won't change the returned template since we will hit the cache.
Now we do a double-estimate approach for getting the final value first estimate
Now we figure out, of the possible found specs, which one we should activate.
Now we have to sort out what kind of entity reference this is
Now we will change back the locale and it will still pick the old template.
Now when a new request for the index action is processed, the layout will vary depending on whether the person accessing is logged in or not.
Now yield to the code that is to define new constants.
Now you can have different transliterations for each locale:
Now you can install packages signed by your private key without any hassle.
Now you can mount your engine in application's routes just like that:
Now, +Engine+ will get only requests that were not handled by +Application+.
Now, I have the mutex
Now, every time something is concatenated to the buffer, it is not appended to an array, but streamed straight to the client.
Now, let's try a file with an extension, really a dot (.)
Now, validate that the source we got back from the template handler is valid in the default_internal.
Null bytes after percent signs are removed:
Number of decimals, behind the separator (the number 1 with a precision of 2 gives: 1.00)
Number of digits to be obtained.
Number of seconds to wait for one block to be read (via one read(2) call).
Number of seconds to wait for the connection to open.
Number.create(i: 0) rescue ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid ...which we ignore.
Number.transaction do Number.create(i: 0) begin This will raise a unique constraint error...
Numbers are not duplicable:
Numeric values are treated as seconds.
Numeric::  it will expire in that many seconds.
O - Enables argument refurbishing.
OK let's get our test on
OK, the BIG doctype test, numba wun
OLEProperty helper class of Property with arguments.
ON DELETE RESTRICT is the default on MySQL

O_NOFOLLOW is not standard.
Oakley curves are not suitable for ECDSA
Object identifier types
Object includes this module.
Object wrapping a reference to a remote drb object.
Object-Oriented Pathname Class
Object: This is a section
Object: section title
Object::sym is out of control.
ObjectSpace.garbage_collect
Objects of AggregateReflection and AssociationReflection are returned by the Reflection::ClassMethods.
Objects of this class are created by RDoc::RD for an extension-less include.
Obsolete: use +subtype+ instead.

Obtain the fat header from raw file data.
Obtains the path to where the object's partial is located.
Obtains the specified cache store class, given the name of the +store+.
Obtains the value for a given +scope_type+ and +model+.
Obviously this RubyGems trust infrastructure doesn't exist yet.
Obviously, discovery takes a little time.
Obviously, the last one is subjective.
Of course, RDoc::Options does not respond to +spell_dictionary+ by default so you will need to add it:
Of course, it is available to make TkTextIO class to support 'byte' access.
Of course, on a case-insensitive fs, both exist because the os reports so.
Of course, rewriting such Tcl/Tk scripts isn't difficult for Tcl/Tk users.
Of course, the most common way of specifying a layout is still just as a plain template name:
Of course, you can also query them directly if the scopes don't fit your needs:
Offense occurs in 2 files, limit is 1, so no Exclude.
Offenses are displayed at compact form - just the location of the problem and the associated message.
Offenses are signaled only on assignment to class variables to reduced the number of offenses that would be reported.
Offset the floors diagonally from each other.
Often referred to as an _object_, hash table, record, struct, keyed list, or associative array.
Often this can be simplified by passing just the name of the model object to +fields_for+ -
Oh well, maybe they'll have better luck causing problems for CPAN users instead :).
Ok, now find a gem that has no conflicts, starting at the highest version.
Ok, this is a bit odd.
Old GDBM's ndbm.h, until 1.8.3, defines dbm_clearerr as a macro which expands to no tokens.
Old Ruby 1.8 CSV library tests.
Old format gems cannot be verified as signed.
Old-format packages cannot be written.
Older tabs won't have these values, so provide sensible defaults
Older version of OpenSSL may not be consistent.
Older versions of tar require an explicit format flag
Omitting will use the default, Timeout::Error
On 10.7 and 10.8 we need to add these directories ourselves.
On 10.8 and newer, these flags will also be present: s - apply fix for sed's Unicode support a - apply fix for apr-1-config path
On 10.9, the tools in /usr/bin proxy to the active developer directory.
On 10.9, there are shims for all tools in /usr/bin.
On JRuby and Rubinius, there's a risk that we hang in tokenize() if we don't set the all errors as fatal flag.
On POSIX systems it's possible to unlink a file before closing it.
On POSIX systems, it's possible to unlink a file right after creating it, and before closing it.
On Ruby 2.0+ keyword arguments can optionally be excluded from the total count.
On all other platforms, including Cygwin, it will return 'make'.
On any platform we don't want a .rubocop.yml file in the temporary directory to affect the outcome of rspec.
On exit, x is the solution vector.
On initialization, the ActiveModel accepts the instance name that will receive the calls:
On machines without Unix-domain sockets, the default is to connect to localhost.
On my machine (OSX 10.8.3 on i5 1.7 GHz) this generates:
On shared hosts, Apache sometimes doesn't pass authentication headers to FCGI instances.
On some database systems, such as PostgreSQL, database errors inside a transaction cause the entire transaction to become unusable until it's restarted from the beginning.
On some platforms (e.g. Solaris), libc malloc does not return freed memory to OS because of efficiency, and linking with extra malloc library is needed to detect memory leaks.
On some platforms such as Windows, write_nonblock is not supported according to the kind of the IO object.
On subsequent requests, the If-None-Match header is set to the cached ETag.
On the client side, receive a reply from the server.
On the client side, send a request to the server.
On the other hand it could be that the target has side-effects, whereas conceptually, from the user point of view, the delegator should be doing one call.
On the other hand, we want to monitor the performance of our real database queries, not the performance of the access to the query cache.
On the server side, receive a request from the client.
On the server side, send a reply to the client.
Once Subclass assigns a value then the value assigned by Subclass would be returned.
Once a mailer action and template are defined, you can deliver your message or defer its creation and delivery for later:
Once for the parent class, once for the child
Once it has uninstalled a gem, it is removed from that list.
Once our chunk of behavior starts pushing the scroll-to-understand-it boundary, we give in and move it to a separate file.
Once rendering the template is done, sets its content in the :layout key.
Once the client has successfully selected a mailbox, they enter _selected_ state, and that mailbox becomes the _current_ mailbox, on which mail-item related commands implicitly operate.
Once the variable is captured by a block, we have no idea when, where and how many times the block would be invoked and it means we cannot track the usage of the variable.
Once you're inside the prompt, you can start debugging your program.
One FormData will be created for each entry.
One by one, each engine sets up its load paths, routes and runs its config/initializers/* files.
One can additionally pass a hash as an argument to unscope specific +:where+ values.
One can generate the same path as the above example by using the following code:
One can specify multiple memcached servers, and MemCacheStore will load balance between all available servers.
One exception is the ActiveRecord::Rollback exception, which will trigger a ROLLBACK when raised, but not be re-raised by the transaction block.
One item for each element in the demo list
One item for each element in this style
One item for each item-column

One layer deep hash of connection values.
One minor exception comes when generating CSV into a String with an Encoding that is not ASCII compatible.
One of +:public+, +:protected+, +:private+ or +:nodoc+.
One of :Stop, :Running or :Shutdown
One query for columns (delete_me table) One query for primary key (delete_me table) One query to do the bulk change
One query for updating name and second query for updating pirate_id
One query for updating name, not triggering query for updating pirate_id
One reason is that editors, such as Emacs, expect this.
One reason you may wish to call this method explicitly is between queries that ask the database to randomize results.
One recommendation is to simply be explicit in a comment, like:
One should always unlink the file after using it, as is explained in the "Explicit close" good practice section in the Tempfile overview:
One should restart the entire transaction if an ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid occurred.
One way to change these is to specify `always_permitted_parameters` in your config.
One way to use this is to pass an array to layout and treat it as an enumerable.
One workaround is to begin a transaction on each class whose models you alter:

OptionParser can be used to automatically generate help for the commands you write:
OptionParser comes with a few ready-to-use kinds of  type coercion.
OptionParser internal utility
OptionParser is a class for command-line option analysis.
OptionParser supports the ability to coerce command line arguments into objects for us.
OptionParser validators will validate and cast user input values.
OptionParser will attempt to parse the argument as a +Time+.
Optional +options+ may be passed in to control the output format.
Optional and mandatory arguments are specified very gracefully.
Optional argument +sep+ means data record separator.
Optional arguments are passed to the constructor of the digest class.
Optional parameter +arg+ is a string pushed back to be the first non-option argument.
Optionally accepts a namespace, and all keys will be scoped within that namespace.
Optionally additional +prerelease+ gems may be included.
Optionally raises an error if the next token is not of the expected type.
Optionally raises an exception if the layout could not be found.
Optionally removes a +type+ column.
Optionally takes +name+ and +version+.

Oracle DATE columns are datetime columns and Oracle adapter returns Time value
Oracle UPDATE does not support ORDER BY
Oracle adapter cannot have specified index name larger than 30 characters Oracle adapter is shortening index name when just column list is given
Oracle adapter returns count() as Fixnum or Float
Oracle adapter returns floating point value 636.0 after SUM
Oracle adapter truncates alias to 30 characters
Oracle adapter uses prefetched primary key values from sequence and passes them to connection adapter insert method
Oracle barfs on this because the join includes unqualified and conflicting column names
Oracle does not allow double quotes in table and column names at all therefore quoting removes them
Oracle does not have a TIME datatype.
Oracle does not support boolean expressions in SELECT
Oracle doesn't differentiate between date/time
Oracle enhanced adapter allows to define Date attributes in model class (see topic.rb)
Oracle has some funky default handling, so it requires a bit of extra testing.
Oracle identifier length is limited to 30 bytes or less, `polymorphic` renamed `poly`
Oracle needs primary key value from sequence
Oracle saves empty string as NULL
Oracle saves empty string as NULL therefore :message changed to one space
Oracle sometimes sorts differently if WHERE condition is changed
Oracle supports precision up to 38 and it identifies decimals with scale 0 as integers
Oracle/SQLServer supports precision up to 38
Order by added as otherwise Oracle tests were failing because of different order of results
Order is the same as that returned by +columns+.
Ordered by desc offense count
Ordinal returns the suffix used to denote the position in an ordered sequence such as 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th.
Ordinalize turns a number into an ordinal string used to denote the position in an ordered sequence such as 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th.
Ordinarily you want to use the default fetcher from Gem::SpecFetcher::fetcher which uses the Gem.sources.

Originally this expression was:
Orphan in Foo::ClassMethods, not Bar::ClassMethods.
Os is the default Apple uses for all its stuff so let's trust them
Other array literals shall have their first element indented one step more than the start of the line where the opening square bracket is.
Other classes we mess with will be dealt with in the specific tests
Other common characters are converted as well:
Other data types need to be serialized.
Other formulae can depend on it and then brew will add the necessary includes and libs (etc.) during the brewing of that other formula.
Other frameworks that are known to cause problems when present
Other hash literals shall have their first key indented one step more than the start of the line where the opening curly brace is.
Other indentation shall be the same regardless of EnforcedStyle.
Other methods, such as `select`, will convert the association to an array and then run the block on the array.
Other namespaces can be added to the root element:
Other options are :shallow for only direct development dependencies of the gems in this set or :all for all development dependencies.
Other options will be handled by the specific cache store implementation.
Other parts happen at the character level: a piece of bold text, a word in code font.
Other preferred methods appearing in the default config (e.g., map over collect) are kept.
Other protocols can be defined.
Other proxy services set the Client-Ip header instead, so we check that too.
Other requests that can contain a body such as PUT can be created in the same way using the corresponding request class (Net::HTTP::Put).
Other than that, the elements of each sub-array can be in any order.
Other token types are not wrapped in spans.
Other useful commands for navigating through your code are:
Other valus can be specified by +options+.
Others remove columns when they migrate up instead of down:
Otherwise +filename+ is overwritten.

Otherwise an IP address is generated from a packed in_addr value and an address family.
Otherwise fall back to double quotes
Otherwise generate a JSON text from the Ruby data structure object and return it.
Otherwise it leaves the body as it found it.
Otherwise it returns an empty array.
Otherwise it returns an empty hash.

Otherwise it's difficult to distinguish between space missing to the left and to the right of the brace in autocorrect.
Otherwise just use the current SHA-1 (which may be overriden later)
Otherwise keep moving upwards in search of an executable.
Otherwise overridden in Railtie to use Rails.cache.
Otherwise padding is generated.
Otherwise remove lines up to the line containing :section:, and look for those lines again at the end and remove them.
Otherwise returns +nil+.
Otherwise returns the full Gem::Specification.
Otherwise returns the irb session with the same top-level binding as the given +key+.
Otherwise returns the result of the block, +nil+ if no callbacks have been set, or +true+ if callbacks have been set but no block is given.
Otherwise strings are returned.
Otherwise the argument refers to some kind of renewer object which will reset its expiry time.
Otherwise the cache would see the same SQL query and repeatedly return the same result each time, silently undermining the randomness you were expecting.
Otherwise the root element is "objects":
Otherwise the string contains just line and text.
Otherwise this method does not work.
Otherwise we may get mismatched pathnames when loading config files later on.
Otherwise, +nil+ is returned.
Otherwise, +to_param+ method will be called.
Otherwise, February 31st or February 29th, 2011 can be selected, which are invalid.
Otherwise, a new DRbObject is created to act as a stub for the remote referenced object.
Otherwise, a new Element is constructed with the argument (see Element.initialize).
Otherwise, a new but identical DRbUnknown object will be returned.

Otherwise, false is returned.
Otherwise, generate a JSON text from the Ruby data structure object and return it.
Otherwise, go to the database only if none of the following are true: * target already loaded * owner is new record * target contains new or changed record(s)
Otherwise, if the String is valid in the encoding, encode immediately to default_internal.
Otherwise, if there is no YAML::Syck, then we've got just psych loaded, so lets define a stub for DefaultKey.
Otherwise, in addition to the in-place modification the method returns +self+ for convenience.
Otherwise, instantiate your own XMLDecl and add it to the document.
Otherwise, it always hits the resolver but if the key is present, check if the resolver is fresher before returning it.
Otherwise, it is the caller's responsibility to close the session when finished.
Otherwise, it returns the current time.
Otherwise, it will yield all descendants which match.
Otherwise, raise an exception
Otherwise, return nil.
Otherwise, returns the result of the block.
Otherwise, returns true after the lock has been acquired.
Otherwise, sections will be displayed in alphabetical order.
Otherwise, serialization bugs may creep in undetected.
Otherwise, since the String is invalid in the encoding specified, raise an exception
Otherwise, tell I18n to raise an exception, which we rescue further in this method.
Otherwise, the +to_param+ method will be called.

Otherwise, the method re-raises the first exception found:
Otherwise, the redirect is performed on the location header.
Otherwise, the result of calling +msg+ will be used as the message if the assertion fails.
Otherwise, the row is assumes to be a field row.
Otherwise, the supplied block is called for each key for which there was no data, and the result will be written to the cache and returned.
Otherwise, the test fails if any exceptions are raised.
Otherwise, the value type is depend on class of value: :Integer REG_DWORD :String REG_SZ :Array REG_MULTI_SZ
Otherwise, this String is set as the content of this instruction.
Otherwise, this child is removed from the current parent (if one exists), and is added to the new parent.
Otherwise, this method deletes all subkeys and values recursively.
Otherwise, this method does nothing.
Otherwise, transaction will raise exceptions when it tries to release the already-automatically-released savepoints:
Otherwise, two corrections can interfere with each other, resulting in corrupted code.
Otherwise, use the report to update the cache.
Otherwise, we need to use an alias
Otherwise, we pass the invalid name forward so the underlying router engine treats it and raises an exception.
Otherwise, workers may oversubscribe the db connection pool and block while they wait for other workers to release their connections.
Otherwise, you might trigger the loading of a child before the parent has registered the callbacks and they won't be inherited.
Our gettext formula will be caught by check_linked_keg_only_brews
Our ld64 fixes many of those builds, though of course we can't depend on it already being installed to build itself.

Overall theme control:
Overridable for esoteric platforms.

Overridden in adapters that require something beyond a simple insert (eg.
Override AbstractController::Base's process_action to run the process_action callbacks around the normal behavior.
Override Rack's GET method to support indifferent access
Override Rack's POST method to support indifferent access
Override author/committer as global settings might be invalid and thus will cause silent failure during the setup of dummy Git repositories.

Overwrite this factory method for Redis connections if you want to use a different Redis connection library than Redis.
Overwrite with false.
Overwrites _layout_for in the context object so it supports the case a block is passed to a partial.

PostgreSQL requires the ORDER BY columns in the select list for distinct queries, and requires that the ORDER BY include the distinct column.
PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Oracle overrides this for custom DISTINCT syntax - they require the order columns appear in the SELECT.
PostgreSQL-specific extensions to column definitions in a table.
Postgres does not preserve insignificant whitespaces when round-tripping jsonb columns.

Psych is a YAML parser and emitter.
Psych is maintained by Aaron Patterson on github: https://github.com/tenderlove/psych
Psych provides a range of interfaces for parsing a YAML document ranging from low level to high level, depending on your parsing needs.
Psych provides a range of interfaces ranging from low to high level for producing YAML documents.
Psych provides access to an AST produced from parsing a YAML document.
Psych simply takes a Ruby data structure and converts it to a YAML document.
Psych uses Psych::Parser in combination with Psych::TreeBuilder to construct an AST of the parsed YAML document.
Psych.load_file("database.yml")
Psych::Handler defines all events that Psych::Parser can possibly send to event handlers.
Psych::Nodes contains all of the classes that make up the nodes of a YAML AST.
Psych::Nodes::Document nodes must have one and *only* one child.
Psych::Nodes::Scalar and Psych::Nodes::Alias are both terminal nodes and should not have any children.
Psych::Nodes::Sequence and Psych::Nodes::Mapping nodes may have many children, but Psych::Nodes::Mapping nodes should have an even number of children.
Public instance methods of a controller would normally be considered action methods, so methods declared on abstract classes are being removed.

Qu is a Ruby library for queuing and processing background jobs.
Qu was created to overcome some shortcomings in the existing queuing libraries.
Quarantining them into one file helps us know when we can get rid of them.
Que is a high-performance alternative to DelayedJob or QueueClassic that improves the reliability of your application by protecting your jobs with the same ACID guarantees as the rest of your data.
Que is a queue for Ruby and PostgreSQL that manages jobs using advisory locks.
Queries are collected asynchronously by the subscriber and returned.
Queries the database and returns the results in an Array-like object
Queries the primary key value.
Query if the following named route was already defined.
Query implementation notes: - format_type includes the column size constraint, e.g. varchar(50) - ::regclass is a function that gives the id for a table name
Query methods allow you to test whether an attribute value is present.
Query parameters on the URL are converted into POST parameters
QueryExtension Exception raised when there is an invalid encoding detected
Querying logic can instead be passed to the `count` call.
Queue in which the job will reside.
Queue: The adapter can set the priority for job queues, when setting a queue with Active Job this will be respected.
Queue: The timeout is set for all jobs on the queue.
Quite straightforward.
Quite strange, but legal ruby.
Quits the current irb context
Quote "type" if it's a reserved word for the current connection.
Quote date/time values for use in SQL input.
Quote the original exception, if there was one
Quotes column names for use in SQL queries.
Quotes schema names for use in SQL queries.
Quotes strings for use in SQL input.
Quotes the column name.
Quotes the table name.
RAILS_ENV needs to be set before config/application is required
RDoc and ri data generation can be enabled or disabled through +generate_rdoc+ and +generate_ri+ respectively.
RDoc automatically cross-references words with underscores or camel-case.
RDoc comes with the HTML generator RDoc::Generator::Darkfish and an ri data generator RDoc::Generator::RI.
RDoc plugin authors can register additional directives to be handled by using RDoc::Markup::PreProcess::register.
RDoc ships with formatters for converting back to rdoc, ANSI text, HTML, a Table of Contents and other formats.
RDoc will always try to emit documentation even if given invalid TomDoc.
RDoc::CrossReference is used to generate those links based on the current context.
RDoc::Extend.new 'Enumerable', 'comment ...'
RDoc::Include and RDoc::Extend are both mixins.
RDoc::Include.new 'Enumerable', 'comment ...'
RDoc::Markup and other markup formats do no output formatting, this is handled by the RDoc::Markup::Formatter subclasses.
RDoc::Markup is intended to be the basis for a family of tools which share the common requirement that simple, plain-text should be rendered in a variety of different output formats and media.

RSS Parser raises error even if this is "should" not "must".
RSS does not allow for free-form tag names, so if an RSS feed contains a tag that we don't know about, an UnknownTagError is raised.
RSS has three different versions.
RSS, being an XML-based format, has namespace support.
RTLD_NEXT is useful for implementing wrappers around library functions.
Racc grammar files resemble yacc files.
Racc is a LALR(1) parser generator.
Rack doesn't handle multipart/mixed for us.
Rack::Sendfile will usually intercept the response and uses the path directly, so there is no reason to open the file.

Round trip a job in memory only
Roundtrip to Rake to allow plugins to hook into database initialization.
Routes can also be constrained to an IP or a certain range of IP addresses:
Routes can generate pretty URLs.
Routes method calls to the referenced remote object.
Routing Concerns allow you to declare common routes that can be reused inside others resources and routes.
Rows may be set to an Array of values (which will inherit the table's headers()) or a CSV::Row.
RuboCop must be in control of where its cached data is stored.
Ruby 1.8 feature change: assigning nil does not remove elements.
Ruby 1.8 feature change: instance_methods includes protected methods.
Ruby 1.8.x comes with Racc runtime module, you need NOT distribute Racc runtime files.
Ruby 1.9 only supports basic whitespace
Ruby 1.9 uses passive mode by default.
Ruby 1.9.x has introduced some things that are awkward, and we need to support them, so we define some constants to use later.
Ruby 2.0 doesn't see Proc as Binding
Ruby 2.0 will have type send every time, and "send nil" if it is calling itself with a specified "self" receiver
Ruby 2.2.2 will have type lvar if it is calling its own method without a specified "self"
Ruby 2.4 will change the behavior of `to_time` to preserve the timezone when converting to an instance of `Time` instead of the previous behavior of converting to the local system timezone.
Ruby Benchmark driver
Ruby Debug provides more advanced functionalities like switching between threads, setting breakpoints and watch expressions, and more.
Ruby benchmark driver
Ruby converts your string into a hash
Ruby does not support `File.lutime` yet.
Ruby doesn't have libraries to support the compress (Lempel-Ziv) compression, so that is not supported.
Ruby expects the argument to be a string and can't convert objects like a hash or array.
Ruby has to allocate memory for the splat expansion every time that the `case` `when` statement is run.
Ruby scripts (i.e. source files with a shebang in the first line) are ignored.
Ruby seems to be depending on HOME in those code samples.
Ruby ships with a custom_require, override its require
Ruby's Encoding object
Ruby/C like octal/hexadecimal/binary integer format, to be converted to Integer.

RubyGems can activate all the gems in your dependencies file at startup using the RUBYGEMS_GEMDEPS environment variable or through Gem.use_gemdeps.
RubyGems defaults are stored in rubygems/defaults.rb.
RubyGems has several different security policies.
RubyGems is currently maintained by Eric Hodel.
RubyGems options use symbol keys.
RubyGems recommends saving this as gem.deps.rb over Gemfile or Isolate.
RubyGems uses the default configured sources if no source was given.
RubyGems was originally developed at RubyConf 2003 by:
RubyGems will automatically find your key and certificate in your home directory and use them to sign newly packaged gems.
Run UDP/IP server loop on the given sockets.
Run `scons` using a Homebrew-installed version rather than whatever is in the `PATH`.
Run `xcodebuild` without Homebrew's compiler environment variables set.
Run a command in git.
Run but do not make any changes"
Run once before each suite
Run postinstall on them because the tested formula might depend on this step
Run the `rake` from the `ruby` Homebrew is using rather than whatever is in the `PATH`.
Run the `ruby` Homebrew is using rather than whatever is in the `PATH`.
Run the provided block and detect the new constants that were loaded during its execution.
Run the server and client code in different terminals, starting the server code first.
Run the supplied block as a work unit, reloading code as needed
Running both things in the same process is a recipe for a night with paracetamol.
Running several Rake tasks in a single command would trip up the runner, as the patterns would also contain the other Rake tasks.
Running that line here causes the SHOW TABLES result to be cached so we don't have to do it again in the block.
Running this method in the above shell would then return:
Runs EXPLAIN on the query or queries triggered by this relation and returns the result as a string.
Runs a block, if given.
Runs all the specified validations and returns +true+ if no errors were added otherwise +false+.
Runs all the validations within the specified context.
Runs in all validation contexts by default (nil).
Runs the callbacks for the given event.
Runs the generator configured for this class.
Runs the given block in a database transaction, and returns the result of the block.
Runs the given migration classes.
Runs the supplied command using either "rake ..." or "rails ..." based on the executor parameter provided.
Runs the supplied rake task (invoked with 'rails ...')
Runs the supplied rake task (invoked with 'rake ...')
RuntimeError for 1.9, TypeError for 1.8
RuntimeError: can't modify frozen instance of Array kernel/common/array.rb:988:in `pop' ./lib/rubocop/cop/style/indentation_width.rb:99:in `on_case'
Ryan Davis suggested the extension to ignore modifiers, because he often writes
S3DownloadStrategy downloads tarballs from AWS S3.
SCHEMA queries cannot be EXPLAINed, also we do not want to run EXPLAIN on our own EXPLAINs no matter how loopingly beautiful that would be.
SDBM.new ignore the block
SEC_WINNT_AUTH_IDENTITY structure
SERVER_ADDR is different from the hostname in the certificate, so the following code should raise a SSLError.

SQL vs Model Load/Exists
SQLite 3.8.2 returns a newly formatted error message: UNIQUE constraint failed: *table_name*.*column_name* Older versions of SQLite return: column *column_name* is not unique
SQLite supports index names up to 64 characters.
SQLite3 will not allow you to add a NOT NULL column to a table without a default value.
SSL features cannot be tested
SSL server doesn't cache sessions so get_cb is called next time.
SSLConfig handles the needed SSL information for establishing a DRbSSLSocket connection, including generating the X509 / RSA pair.
SSLError, not RuntimeError
SSL_SESSION_time keeps long value so we can't keep nsec fragment.

Second, use canonical name to locate rack.
Second, we rely on the fact that the WebSocket connection is established with the cookies from the domain being sent along.
Second: Modifies the SELECT statement for the query so that only certain fields are retrieved:
Secondly, the field values shown when the form is initially displayed are taken from the attributes of the object passed to +form_for+, regardless of whether the object is an instance variable.

Setting CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK to "LAST" tells CMake to search for our libraries before trying to utilize Frameworks, many of which will be from 3rd party installs.
Setting behaviors only affects deprecations that happen after boot time.
Setting it to +true+ will _always_ save the members, whereas setting it to +false+ will _never_ save the members.
Setting it to nil is useful to re-enable template lookup overriding a previous configuration set in the parent:
Setting the :extname option will control what extension (if any) is appended to the url for assets
Setting the default to +nil+ effectively drops the default:
Setting the layout to nil forces it to be looked up in the filesystem and fallbacks to the parent behavior if none exists.
Setting the value object to +nil+ has the effect of writing +nil+ to all mapped attributes.
Setting this check to "always" and "when_needed" makes sense only for code that should support Ruby 1.9, since in 2.0+ utf-8 is the default source file encoding.
Setting this flag comes at the price in the form of a performance loss.
Setting this is useful when you want delivery notifications sent to a different address than the one in +:from+.
Setting this option prepends a select option with a generic prompt  (Day, Month, Year, Hour, Minute, Seconds) or the given prompt string.

Similarly if parent class changes the value then that would change the value of subclasses too.
Similarly, a simple hash without a statement will generate conditions based on equality with the SQL AND operator.
Similarly, if any of the +before_remove+ callbacks throw an exception, the object will not be removed from the collection.
Similarly, if the parent class changes the value, the value of subclasses is not changed.
Similarly, if you want it to also look up in the rails namespace, you just need to provide the :in value:

Since +audio_url+ is based on +asset_url+ method you can set :host options.
Since +font_url+ is based on +asset_url+ method you can set :host options.
Since +image_url+ is based on +asset_url+ method you can set :host options.
Since +javascript_url+ is based on +asset_url+ method you can set :host options.
Since +stylesheet_url+ is based on +asset_url+ method you can set :host options.
Since +video_url+ is based on +asset_url+ method you can set :host options.
Since Active Record can figure out the ID of any fixture from its label, you can specify FK's by label instead of ID.
Since HTML and JavaScript requests are typically made from the browser, we need to ensure to verify request authenticity for the web browser.
Since IPv6 addresses are wrapped by brackets in URIs, this method returns IPv6 addresses wrapped by brackets.
Since MonitorMixin.new_cond returns a ConditionVariable, and the example above calls while_wait and signal, this class should be documented.
Since REXML is non-validating, this method is not implemented as it requires a DTD
Since RFC 2822 permit comments, the regexp has no right anchor.
Since RSS is based on XML, it must have opening and closing tags that match.
Since Rails::Railtie cannot be instantiated, any methods that call +instance+ are intended to be called only on subclasses of a Railtie.
Since Ruby 1.8, REXML is included in the standard Ruby distribution.
Since Ruby does not support fall through inside of `case` `when`, like some other languages do, the order of the `when` branches does not matter.
Since UserInteraction dispatches to a concrete UI class you may need to reference other classes for specific behavior such as Gem::ConsoleUI or Gem::SilentUI.
Since autocorrect changes a number of lines, and not only the line where the reported offending range is, we avoid auto-correction if this cop has already found other offenses is the same range.
Since cache entries in most instances will be serialized, the internals of this class are highly optimized using short instance variable names that are lazily defined.
Since classes don't know their subclasses, we have to build the hierarchy between self and the record's class.
Since client_addr is not an IP address of this host, bind() in TCPSocket.new should fail as EADDRNOTAVAIL.
Since escaping tags is now default, this can be used when you don't want Rails to automatically escape tags.
Since fixtures are a testing construct, we use them in our unit and functional tests.
Since it always passes a ::JSON::State object as the only argument to to_json, we can detect that and forward the calls to the original to_json method.
Since it is implemented by the standard library module Find, Find.prune can be used to control the traversal.
Since it's not easy to get the position of the "else" keyword, we check "else" body against latest "when" keyword indentation.
Since jobs share a single thread pool, long-running jobs will block short-lived jobs.
Since minitest only loads plugins if its extensions are empty we have to call `load_plugins` first.
Since most emails do something interesting with database data, you'll need to write some scenarios to load messages with fake data:
Since only one table is loaded at a time, conditions or orders cannot reference tables other than the main one.
Since some of them reopen ActiveSupport::Deprecation its autoload would be triggered, resulting in a circular require warning for active_support/deprecation.rb.
Since the +notice+ and +alert+ keys are a common idiom, convenience accessors are available:
Since the IP address may not be needed, we store the object here without calculating the IP to keep from slowing down the majority of requests.
Since the argument is the object that the given block shall make calls on to build something based on the enumerable that each_with_object iterates over, an immutable argument makes no sense.
Since the association adds a method with that name to its model, it will override the inherited method and break things.
Since the change could (theoretically) introduce parsing errors, we break the loop if we find any.
Since the order is incomplete nothing will be shown
Since the preloader for habtm gets raw row hashes from the database and then instantiates them, this test ensures that it only instantiates one actual object per record from the database.
Since the source has a trailing newline, there is a final empty line
Since there are numerous conflicts among locally defined time zone abbreviations all over the world, this method is not intended to understand all of them.
Since there is overhead, values must be large enough to warrant compression.
Since these exceptions are captured in transaction blocks, the parent block does not see it and the real transaction is committed.
Since this formatter does not alter whitespace nodes, the results of formatting already formatted XML will be odd.
Since this is a subclass of the RDoc markup parser there isn't much to see here, unfortunately.
Since this is currently depending on Redcarpet to cooperate, we are going to be naive, and only allow line highlighting when a language is specified.
Since this is currently only called for docs, we can be lazy and just say it's documentation.
Since this key is generated only once during the request, it speeds up all cache accesses.
Since this loop needs the constants it would be inconsistent to assume they should exist at this point.
Since we could use these values as Host header, we choose the initial(first) value.
Since we define a new cop class, we have to do this in a separate process.
Since we don't want the callbacks to get defined multiple times, there are guards that check if the save or validation methods have already been defined before actually defining them.
Since we have no idea, if we are concerned about IP spoofing we need to give up and explode.
Since we keep references from children to parents and not just the other way around, we cannot update an AST and share identical subtrees.
Since we're processing the view in a different thread, copy the thread locals from the main thread to the child thread.

Single quotes not escaped in Ruby 1.9, so add extra substitution.
SingleForwardable can be used to setup delegation at the object level as well.

Small Roman Numeral One
Small macro to add ruby as an option to the generator with proper default value plus an instance helper method called shebang.
Sneakers is being used in production for both I/O and CPU intensive workloads, and have achieved the goals of high-performance and 0-maintenance, as designed.
Snow Leopard defines an NCURSES value the opposite of most distros.
So +0000 is a local time such as Europe/London, etc.
So +associations+ could look like this:
So 29s gets rounded down to 0m, 30s gets rounded up to 1m, and 1m29s gets rounded down to 1m.
So Berkeley DB header with GDBM library causes the problem.
So HTTP_PROXY is not used.
So I will close the connection in every response.
So IO::WaitReadable can be used to rescue the exceptions for retrying accept_nonblock.
So IO::WaitReadable can be used to rescue the exceptions for retrying read_nonblock.
So IO::WaitReadable can be used to rescue the exceptions for retrying recv_nonblock.
So IO::WaitReadable can be used to rescue the exceptions for retrying recvfrom_nonblock.
So IO::WaitWritable can be used to rescue the exceptions for retrying connect_nonblock.
So IO::WaitWritable can be used to rescue the exceptions for retrying write_nonblock.
So RUBY_PLATFORM in this process is not useful to detect it.
So a join between Developer and Project will give the default join table name of "developers_projects" because "D" precedes "P" alphabetically.
So all tests will cause failure.
So although this class does not explicitly document all instance methods supported by File, you can in fact call any File instance method on a Tempfile object.
So application should close it explicitly.
So application should close it.
So as an example, 0x677E is the same as "E69DBE" (but somewhat easier to produce and check).
So basically you should use transaction blocks whenever you have a number of statements that must be executed together or not at all.
So check t1 and t0 are in error by less than one millisecond.
So concurrent mechanism, thread for example, should be used to service multiple clients at a time.
So descendants of MyApp::Business::Account would appear as MyApp::Business::AccountSubclass.
So disable rubocop here.
So don't use /tmp/malicious-users-directory/socket.
So either extending the provided method below, or rolling your own is required.
So for example you may use a named route directly.
So for instance, 3.10 sorts higher than 3.2 because ten is greater than two.
So gemspecs created under these versions of Syck will have references to Syck::DefaultKey.
So if no month select is available, January will be assumed.
So if set to "basecamp_", all table names will be named like "basecamp_projects", "basecamp_people", etc.
So if the canvas that holds the plot is to be resized, the whole plot must be redrawn.
So if the predicate returns +true+ the attribute will become +false+.
So if you have "myapp_" as a prefix, the table name guess for an Invoice class becomes "myapp_invoices".
So in the example above, the irregular rule for octopus will now be the first of the pluralization and singularization rules that is runs.
So in the nil case, no caching will take place, but that's ok since the nil case is not the common one that we wish to optimise for.
So instead of trusting certificates on a per-developer basis, we use the PKI concept of certificate chains to build a logical hierarchy of trust.
So it can be referenced later.
So it is a local time.
So it should be careful to use it.
So it's no catch-all for performance problems, but it's a great way to cut down on the number of queries in a situation as the one described above.
So it's possible that changing something outside of that call will still expire the cache.
So it's unneeded whether there are offenses or not.
So mismatch check is not performed for that.
So no packets should be generated.
So pass the file name without the extension.
So passing a Workshop object will attempt to use the +workshop_path+ route.
So the task of this method is to merge them according to the following rules:
So the template digest for the current action is automatically included in the ETag.
So the the method argument nodes need to be processed in current scope.
So the three-lined example in "Using partials" can be rewritten with a single line:
So the value of path_info should be normalize before accessing to the filesystem.
So the values are scoped within the Thread.current space under the class name of the module.
So there is no need to eager load them.
So they update the counter cache.
So this feature will be removed.
So this method creates an array of scopes corresponding to the chain.
So this would be wrong:
So to work around this we first define with the __temp__ identifier, and then use alias method to rename it to what we want.
So we abbreviate the spec, making it much smaller for quicker downloads.
So we check that initially parsed and reparsed duration added to time will result in the same time.
So we consider it's used to suppress false positive offenses.
So we create a whitelist here to allow overwriting certain files.
So we group by the classes as well.
So we need to be sure that we reference Syck at the toplevel too so that we can always load these kind of gemspecs.
So we need to force their encoding to binary before applying the regular expression to ensure we are escaping all characters properly.
So we need to require this upfront to ensure we don't get a false failure, but ideally we should just fix the BigDecimal core_ext to not change to_s without arguments.
So we need to store the path at file load and revert back to it after each test.
So we only load the YAML code if we find some real code in there.
So we should build a relation to merge in rather than directly merging the values.
So we'll just skip it.
So what can be written like this:
So you shouldn't use it for elements that will be fragment cached.
So you specify the object you want messaged on a given callback.
So you'd have a concern something like this:
So, They may not work on your Tcl/Tk.
So, any mass-assignment idiom like
So, any strong parameters idiom like
So, at operator assignment node, we need to reference the variable before processing rhs nodes.
So, calling a 'treectrl' command for loading the dll with the auto_load facility.
So, for example, if we had a _local_ variable +post+ representing an existing record,
So, if 8.4.7 or later, set RUN_EVENTLOOP_ON_MAIN_THREAD to true.
So, if we had a comments page and wanted to render a "Go Back" link instead of a link to the comments page, we could do something like this...
So, it is suitable for factorizing an integer which is not large but has many prime factors.
So, ruby1.9 users must call Tk.mainloop on the main application thread.
So, some old scripts don't work, because those scripts use the procedure to define local styles.
So, the followings raises an exception.
So, the target may be non-empty and still lack children waiting to be read from the database.
So, to dup an arbitrary object you normally use an optimistic approach and are ready to catch an exception, say:
So, try to check header/library mismatch.
So, using a block, you might do something as simple as limit the actions available on certain resources, passing standard resource options through the concern:
So, we define the constant first, and load dependencies later.
So, we have to rearrange things so that the request looks like this (url-encoded):
Socket.getaddrinfo(left, nil, Socket::AF_INET6, Socket::SOCK_STREAM, nil, Socket::AI_NUMERICHOST)
Socket.tcp_server_loop succeeds if one socket can be used at least.
Socket.udp_server_loop can be implemented using this method as follows.
SocketError:: Hostname not known or other socket error.
Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX) standard open-source software license identifiers
Software is unlikely to link against libraries from build-time deps, so it doesn't matter if they link against different C++ stdlibs.
Software that will not be sym-linked into the `brew --prefix` will only live in its Cellar.
Solaris returns IPv4 address for ::ffff:1.2.3.4.
Solve complex equations
Some CDNs only support strong ETags and will ignore weak ETags entirely.
Some ORM systems do not use IDs on nested models so in this case you want to be able to disable the hidden id.
Some are aliased such as "rails:migration" and can be invoked with the shorter "migration", others are private to other generators such as "css:scaffold".
Some arguments may be passed via environment variables:
Some arithmetic expressions including parenthesis can be generated as follows.
Some arithmetic expressions using "+", "-", "*" and "/" are generated as follows.
Some cache implementation may optimize this method.
Some commands like +remove_column+ cannot be reversed.
Some common code shared between FavorUnlessOverNegatedIf and FavorUntilOverNegatedWhile.
Some configuration can be passed through +options+.
Some configuration options like :group make it impossible to do an SQL count, in those cases the array count will be used.
Some configure scripts won't find libxml2 without help
Some databases impose a limit on the number of ids in a list (in Oracle it's 1000) Make several smaller queries if necessary or make one query if the adapter supports it
Some documentation comment...
Some examples are appropriate at this point.
Some extensions can only be made to work with knowledge of the association's internals.
Some extra features are included to take advantage of Ruby's style and strengths.
Some familiar aliases for the SecHandle structure
Some gems consist of pre-compiled code ("binary gems").
Some gems contain C (or other) code to be compiled into a Ruby "extension".
Some header fields should not be transferred.
Some just fix the data:
Some linkers produce multiple `LC_LOAD_DYLIB` load commands for the same library, but at this point we're really only interested in a list of unique libraries this Mach-O file links to, thus: `uniq`.
Some local variables fix the problem.
Some not very comprehensive tests of block behavior.
Some of the documentation is in this class, some in the modules CGI::QueryExtension and CGI::HtmlExtension.
Some of these flags are mutually exclusive.
Some of these gems do not call to_s implicitly.
Some of these parts are high-level: paragraphs, chunks of verbatim text, list entries and the like.
Some other useful accessors (mon_count and some queue stuff) are also in this module, and don't appear directly in the RDoc output.
Some parts adapted from http://golang.org/src/pkg/json/decode.go and http://golang.org/src/pkg/utf8/utf8.go
Some port configuration
Some reserved IP v.4 addresses
Some software links metafiles together, so by the time we iterate to one of them we may have already moved it.
Some software symlinks these files (see help2man.rb)
Some special arrangements have to be made for operator methods.
Some systems are broken and have it in /bin
Some tags must only exist a specific number of times in a given RSS feed.
Some tests depend on assumption that this attribute will have Date values.
Some tests need two paths.
Some things may be non-dry for a reason.
Some times you don't care about the content of the fixtures as much as you care about the volume.
Some times you'll have template dependencies that can't be derived at all.
Some transcoding must take place, of course, to accomplish this multiencoding support.
Some transformations are destructive in a manner that cannot be reversed.
Some versions of `mktmpdir` return absolute paths, which will break make if the paths contain spaces.
Some wrappers are non-functional and will return a non-zero exit code when invoked for version info.
Something like this should look familiar:
Sometime in the 1.9 dev cycle, the Syck constant was moved from under YAML to be a toplevel constant.
Sometimes benchmark results are skewed because code executed earlier encounters different garbage collection overheads than that run later.
Sometimes it is useful to have access to the owner object when building the query.
Sometimes non-ASCII characters will garble the site index.
Sometimes the code needs that the callbacks execute in a specific order.
Sometimes we accidentally install files outside prefix.
Sometimes we have to change a bit before we install.
Sometimes you do not want to subscribe to an event for the entire life of the application.
Sometimes you may want to isolate engine, but use helpers that are defined for it.
Sometimes you need to set up the session and cookie variables for a test.
Sometimes you want to alternate layouts depending on runtime information, such as whether someone is logged in or not.
Sometimes you want to be able to read the raw attribute data without having the column-determined typecast run its course first.
Sometimes you'll have exceptions where one action wants to use a different layout than the rest of the controller.
Sometimes you'll want to add a column in a migration and populate it immediately after.
Sometimes, you have a resource that clients always look up without referencing an ID.
Sorry, but for the foreseeable future, DTD support in REXML is pretty weak on convenience.
Sort dependencies so that the ones that are easiest to resolve are first.
Sort eigenvalues and corresponding vectors.
Sort through the various IP address headers, looking for the IP most likely to be the address of the actual remote client making this request.
Sources may be paths to JavaScript files.

TSort implements topological sorting using Tarjan's algorithm for strongly connected components.
TSort is designed to be able to be used with any object which can be interpreted as a directed graph.
TSort requires two methods to interpret an object as a graph, tsort_each_node and tsort_each_child.
TTY case: If possible, output using multiple columns.
Table aliases are automatically truncated according to the maximum length of table identifiers according to the specific database.
Table names + table aliases
Tables allow you to work with the data by row or column, manipulate the data, and even convert the results back to CSV, if needed.
Tabs are not allowed.
Tag the source with the default external encoding or the encoding specified in the file
TagMaker Mixin module providing HTML generation methods.
Tags are declared in the server but computed in the connection.
Tags for the old widget are not affected, however.
Take a simple example where the layout expects the template to tell which title to use:
Take a string with embedded escapes, and convert the escapes as the Ruby interpreter would when reading a double-quoted string literal.
Take callback names and an optional callback proc, normalize them, then call the block with each callback.
Take care of the broken text/xml entry by renaming or deleting it
Take care when implementing a plugin as your plugin file may be loaded multiple times if multiple versions of your gem are installed.
Take control of all existing connections so a "group" action such as reload/disconnect can be performed safely.
Take for instance Active Record subscriber tests:
Take into account that this does not include helpers defined in controllers with helper_method or other similar solutions, only helpers defined in the helpers directory will be included.
Take note that in that last case, the results are sorted in ascending order:
Take search results -- a hash mapping formula names to descriptions -- and print them.
Take the following route definition as an example:
Take the text and format it, indented two spaces for each line, and wrapped at 72 columns:
Taken from http://yaml.org/type/float.html
Taken from http://yaml.org/type/int.html
Taken from http://yaml.org/type/timestamp.html
Takes +indent+ arg, but does nothing with it.
Takes +label+ option.
Takes a String and parses it out
Takes a block and queues a new group that is indented 1 level further.
Takes a connection URL.
Takes a hash as its argument.
Takes a path to a file.
Takes a return result from an SSPI function and interprets the value.
Takes a single argument which is to be treated like a hashtable, or defaults to ENV, the system environment.
Takes a token and gets the next token in the Negotiate authentication chain.
Takes an action name and returns the name of the method that will handle the action.
Takes an element or elements or array of elements.
Takes an optional argument +i+, which specifies how many callers up the stack to look.
Takes any object which implements the each_pair method, including Hash and DBM objects.
Takes in a limit and checks if the attributes_collection has too many records.
Takes in an array of nested modules and extracts the last module
Takes raw_params and turns it into an array of parameters
Takes the arguments that will be passed to the perform method.
Takes the environment such as +:production+ or +:development+.
Takes the first digit of the reply code to determine the status type
Takes the line number of a given code line and returns a string containing the previous line that's not a comment line or a blank line.
Takes the same argument as GetoptLong.new.
Tap repository if required, this is done before everything else because Formula parsing and/or git commit hash lookup depends on it.
Tasks and dependencies are specified in standard Ruby syntax.
Tcl/Tk 8.5 beta or later
Tcl/Tk 8.5+ work with dockable frames
Tcl/Tk-JP for Windows
TclTk._addcallback(ca): register callback ca: callback(TclTkCallback)
TclTk._callcallback(key, arg): invoke registered callback key: key to select callback (to_s value of the TclTkCallback) arg: parameter from tcl/tk interpreter
TclTk._newname(prefix): generate unique name(String) prefix: prefix of the unique name
TclTk.dcb(ca, wid, W): call TclTk.deletecallbackkey() for each callbacks in an array.

Technically MySQL allows to create indexes with the sort order syntax but at the moment (5.5) it doesn't yet implement them
Technically other types of keys are accepted:
Technically this method can be used to fetch terminal values:
Technically, it looks for the least indented non-empty line in the whole string, and removes that amount of leading whitespace.
Tell clang/gcc where system include's are:
Tell the user about any caveats regarding this package.
Tempfile itself however may not be entirely thread-safe.
Tempfile's filename picking method is both thread-safe and inter-process-safe: it guarantees that no other threads or processes will pick the same filename.
Template lookup accounts for the action name, locales, format, variant, template handlers, and more (see +render+ for details).
Template's mime type is used if no content_type is specified
Templates can be used concurrently in threaded environments so compilation and any instance variable modification must be synchronized
Templates can share variables amongst themselves by using instance variables defined using the regular embedding tags.
Templates in the collection not already cached are written to cache.
Templates may generate a "see also ..." if this method/attribute has documentation, and "see ..." if it does not.
Temporarily give up all held Share locks while executing the supplied block, allowing any +compatible+ exclusive lock request to proceed.
Temporary skip passing the details_key forward.
Terminates option parsing.
Terminates the irb sessions specified by the given +keys+.

Thanks for your patience.
Thanks to Gavin Sinclair for some feedback on the documentation.
Thanks to Hal Fulton for hosting the Codefest.
Thanks to James Tucker for the Gem tricks involved in this call.
Thanks to Matz for suggestions about the class design.
Thanks to repeated auto-correction, we can get rid of the trailing spaces, and then the extra empty line.
That action implicitly responds to all formats, but formats can also be whitelisted:
That carries the usual limitations.
That child may be one of:
That code returns right away, you are just subscribing to "render" events.
That could be weird, but if we parse P1Y1M0.5D and output it to ISO 8601, we'll get P1Y1MT12.0H.
That does not depend on whether the collection has already been loaded or not.
That first executes the block and then notifies all subscribers once done.
That intermediary AST is then translated in to a Ruby object graph.
That is automatically set to ascending on the primary key ("id ASC") to make the batch ordering consistent.
That is automatically set to ascending on the primary key ("id ASC") to make the batch ordering work.
That is, a normal hash merge, with the addition that any value that is a hash, and occurs in both arguments, will also be merged.
That is, at each point in time, at most one thread may be executing any of its methods.
That is, do not execute statements like 'CREATE TABLE' inside such blocks.
That is, entities have been expanded to their values
That is, for every element that is an array, * extract its elements into the new array.
That is, the attribute with entities intact.
That is, the request API client will handle the session for you instead of Rails.
That is: row +i+, column +j+.
That makes for an almost textbook perfect example of how to use delegation.
That means it does not have headers or a body.
That means that modifying attributes of the clone will modify the original, since they will both point to the same attributes hash.
That means that the message will be sent bypassing checking +perform_deliveries+ and +raise_delivery_errors+, so use with caution.
That means you have to take special care not to do anything silly in a channel that would balloon its memory footprint or whatever.
That object knows how to convert the events to a YAML document.
That one is particularly useful for serving assets from an SSL-protected page.
That rescue is very expensive (like 40 times slower than a predicate), and it is often triggered.
That said, when streaming, you need to properly check your templates and choose when to use +provide+ and +content_for+.
That way, the middleware will ignore those IP addresses, and return the one that you want.
That will ensure all the data transferred via HTTPS protocol and prevent the user from getting their session hijacked when accessing the site over unsecured HTTP protocol.
That will make infinite loop.
That will set the +target_prefix+ in the generated Makefile to "test".
That works that way because the involved helpers know whether the resource is a new record or not, and generate HTML accordingly.
That would add something like "Process data files (345.2ms)" to the log, which you can then use to compare timings when optimizing your code.
That would just give each lambda the same reference and they would all get the last value of each.
That's a string with the absolute path of the asset, for example "/assets/rails.png".
That's an instance of the class ActiveRecord::Reflection::AssociationReflection.
That's done by replacing the question marks with symbols and supplying a hash with values for the matching symbol keys:
That's how you typically work with resources.
That's the case with our +balance+ attribute.
That's what you want the bulk of the time.
That's why a JSON string is returned.
That's why this is much more elaborate than the string version.
The  former  will  find the  first  occurrence  of the desired symbol using the default library search order.
The "central auto-correction engine" can't handle intermediate states where the code has syntax errors, so it's important to fix the trailing whitespace in this cop.
The '.' lets us handle SWIG-generated files
The 'value_of_e' field is defined as 'DECIMAL' with precision/scale explicitly left out.
The +:Realm+ is used to provide different access to different groups across several resources on a server.

The +FormBuilder+ object is yielded when using +form_for+ or +fields_for+.
The +Matrix+ class represents a mathematical matrix.
The +ParamsWrapper+ will actually try to determine the list of attribute names from the model and only wrap those attributes:
The +Path+ object is simply an enumerable and allows you to easily add extra paths:
The +String+ MIME type of the request.
The +TemplateRenderer+ and +PartialRenderer+ objects are wrappers which do all the setup and logic necessary to render a view and a new object is created each time +render+ is called.
The +Ticker+ publishes a time and a price, and the warners receive that.
The +Vector+ class represents a mathematical vector, which is useful in its own right, and also constitutes a row or column of a Matrix.
The +accept+ method on OptionParser may be used to create converters.
The +add+ method accepts the following options as arguments: eager_load, autoload, autoload_once and glob.

The +attributes+ parameter can be either a Hash or an Array of Hashes.
The +auth_type+ parameter is a string that represents the authentication mechanism to be used.
The +authenticate_or_request_with_http_digest+ block must return the user's password or the ha1 digest hash so the framework can appropriately hash to check the user's credentials.
The +authenticator+ is an object which defines a process() method to handle authentication with the server.
The +basename+ parameter is used to determine the name of the temporary file.
The +block_parser+ is used to for footnotes and labels in the inline text.
The +checked_value+ defaults to 1 while the default +unchecked_value+ is set to 0 which is convenient for boolean values.
The +class_name+ of the +attachable+ is passed as a String.
The +comments+ resource here will have the following routes generated for it:
The +config+ is completely unused, so passing nil is sufficient.
The +constants+ and +attributes+ collections are sorted.
The +custom_proxies+ argument can take an Array of string, IPAddr, or Regexp objects which will be used instead of +TRUSTED_PROXIES+.
The +defaults+ parameter is unused.
The +digest_algorithm+ is written to a read-only +name+.sum file following the given file contents containing the digest name and hexdigest separated by a tab.
The +div_radio_button+ code from above can now be used as follows:
The +errors+ property of this exception contains an array of AttributeAssignmentError objects that should be inspected to determine which attributes triggered the errors.
The +exit+ command, or ::irb_exit, will quit the current session and call any exit hooks with IRB.irb_at_exit.
The +expires_in+ parameter can override the value set when the entry was created.
The +extension+ argument allows you to pass a block into a has_and_belongs_to_many association.

The +extras+ parameter is used to tell the request the names and values of additional request parameters that would be in a query string.
The +facility+ may be set to specify the facility level which will be used.
The +faultCode+ and +faultString+ of the exception in a Hash.
The +force_restore_state+ argument indicates if the record state should be rolled back to the beginning or just to the last savepoint.

The +func+ shall be either mere function name or function name with arguments.
The +get_attribute_ns+ method retrieves a method by its namespace and name.
The +given_day_in_next_week+ defaults to the beginning of the week which is determined by +Date.beginning_of_week+ or +config.beginning_of_week+ when set.
The +hash+ parameter has following case-insensitive keys: * host * path * port * proxy_host * proxy_port * user * password * use_ssl * timeout
The +helper+ class method can take a series of helper module names, a block, or both.
The +id+ parameter must match the constraint passed in for this example.
The +info+ hash is optional, and if given is used to define metadata about the current schema (currently, only the schema's version):
The +input+ and +output+ arguments can be anything CSV::new() accepts (generally String or IO objects).
The +installer+ will be +nil+ if a gem matching the request was already installed.
The +interface+ parameter must be an instance of XMLRPC::Service::Interface.
The +ip_spoofing_check+ option is on by default.

The +message+ parameter allows you to specify a custom error message for assertion failures.
The +message+ parameter allows you to specify a custom error message to display upon failure.
The +method+ parameter is converted into a String and should be a valid XML-RPC method-name.
The +name+ is only used to track the repository back to a gem dependencies file, it has no real significance as a git repository may contain multiple gems.
The +name+, +version+ and +platform+ are the name, version and platform of the gem.
The +new_session+ option can be used to either always or never create a new session.
The +null+ flag indicates whether the value can be +NULL+.
The +offset+ can be used to locate duplicate header names, as described in CSV::Row.field().
The +options+ argument must be a hash whose keys are *symbols*.
The +options+ hash is passed downwards:
The +options+ hash is passed to each annotation's +to_s+.
The +options+ parameter can be anything CSV::new() understands.
The +options+ parameter is also filtered down to CSV::new() after some clever key parsing.
The +options+ supports two additional keys for convenience and conformance:
The +parsers+ argument can take Hash of parsers where key is identifying content mime type, and value is a lambda that is going to process data.
The +precision+ parameter can be used to limit seconds' precision of duration.
The +prefix+ for this Notifier, which is appended to all objects being inspected during output.
The +rdoc+ object passed to the block is an RDoc::Task object.
The +sec+ option for the write, take, move, read and notify methods may either be a number of seconds or a Renewer object.

The +sep+ argument from ::new
The +set+ contains other specifications for this (URL) +source+.
The +set+ parameter is a number or a range between two numbers, or an array of those.
The +set+ parameter is a number, an array of numbers, or a Range object.
The +signer+ is used to add a digest file using its digest_algorithm per add_file_digest and a cryptographic signature in +name+.sig.

The +source+ can be a full path or a file.
The +source+ can be full path or file that exists in your public audios directory.
The +source+ is either where the +spec+ came from, or should be loaded from.
The +source+ is ignored.
The +sources+ can be full paths or files that exists in your public videos directory.
The +sql+ parameter is a full SQL query as a string.
The +src+ argument is meant to be an image file path.
The +srcprefix+ argument can be used to override the default source directory, i.e. the current directory.
The +srcprefix+ should be used when your source files are not in the same directory as your build script.
The +subscribe+ method returns a subscriber object:
The +target+ name should correspond the name of the global function name defined within your C extension, minus the +Init_+.
The +tuple+ must be the same size as the template.
The +type+ and +options+ parameters will be ignored if present.
The +type+ should be a full HTTP content type, e.g. "text/html".

The +url+ may be an +http:+-type link or a cross-reference to a class, module or method with a label.
The +values+ are the options that can be selected from the Select menu.
The --no-color CLI option sets `color: false` so we don't want the `no_color` key, which is created automatically.
The -isysroot is needed, too, because of the Frameworks
The -o option can change the output filename.
The .other directory is explicitly included, so the configuration file is read, and modifies the behavior.
The .pem files generated by --build and --sign are PEM files.
The .rubocop.yml file inherits from default.yml where the Include config parameter is set for the rails cops.
The 3-element array should contains cmsg_level, cmsg_type and data.
The :ProxyContentHandler proc will be invoked before sending a response to the User-Agent.
The :call-seq: is indented from the baseline.
The :category: directive will override the :section: directive.
The :markup: directive tells RDoc which format to use.

The InvalidRSSError error is the base class for a variety of errors related to a poorly-formed RSS feed.
The JSON gem adds a few modules to Ruby core classes containing :to_json definition, overwriting their default behavior.
The JSON literal is not numeric, but if the other end knows by contract that the data is supposed to be a BigDecimal, it still has the chance to post-process the string and get the real value.
The LUP decomposition with pivoting always exists, even if the matrix is singular, so the constructor will never fail.

The Proc should take two arguments:
The Queue in stdlib's 'thread' could replace this class except stdlib's doesn't support waiting with a timeout.
The RDoc Markdown parser has the following built-in behaviors that cannot be disabled.
The RDoc project is the appropriate location to find this functionality.
The RDoc::Store instance holds documentation for parsed source code.
The Rails core team has stated patches for the inflections library will not be accepted in order to avoid breaking legacy applications which may be relying on errant inflections.

The WatchStack keeps a stack of the modules being watched as files are loaded.
The X11.app distributed by Apple is also XQuartz, and therefore covered by this method.
The XLIST command is like the LIST command except that the flags returned refer to the function of the folder/mailbox, e.g. :Sent
The XML builder seems to fail miserably when trying to tag something with the same name as a Kernel method (throw, test, loop, select ...)
The XQuartz that Apple shipped in OS X through 10.7 does not have a pkg-util entry, so if Spotlight indexing is disabled we must make an educated guess as to what version is installed.
The YAML document is read from STDIN and written back out to STDERR:
The _msg_ is a string.
The _msg_src_ is a Socket::UDPSource object.
The _opts_ argument can be used to configure the generator.
The _opts_ argument is passed through to generate/parse respectively.
The _timeout_ specify the seconds for timeout.
The `:force` option is useful when you're calling some other method to ask whether you should force a cache write.
The `as` option sets the format to JSON, sets the content type to 'application/json' and encodes the parameters as JSON.
The `cached: true` will make Action View's rendering read several templates from cache at once instead of one call per template.
The `case` node plus the first `when` score one complexity point together.
The `depends_on` method in the formula DSL is used to declare dependencies and requirements.
The `elsif` node will get an `on_if` call from the framework later, but we're done here, so we set it to ignored.
The `if` node must have only `if` body since we excluded `if` with `else` above.
The `threads` method setting takes two numbers a minimum and maximum.
The `wget` :    formula serves as a simple example.
The above URI indicates that the client should connect to ftp.example.com then cd pub/ruby from the initial login directory.
The above YAML document consists of three lists, an outer list that contains two inner lists.
The above YAML document consists of three maps, an outer map that contains two inner maps.
The above YAML document contains a list with four strings.
The above allows you to do:

The above code will load all the comments and all of their associated authors and gravatars.
The above content may be added in the future.
The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.
The above declaration creates two gems, a-1 and b-1, with a dependency from b to a.
The above example will now change /posts/new to /posts/brand_new
The above example's HTML is:
The above examples should be enough to learn how to use this class.
The above script would generate the following extconf.h file:
The abstract adapter is used simply to bypass the bit of code that checks that the adapter file can be required in.
The accent bug, and the code that exhibits the bug, was contributed by Guilhem Vellut
The access sequence is defined by RFC 1738
The acronym, however, must occur as a delimited unit and not be part of another word for conversions to recognize it:
The activated gem's paths are inserted before site lib directory by default.
The active irb session
The actual before_action that is used to verify the CSRF token.
The actual file is accessible via the +tempfile+ accessor, though some of its interface is available directly for convenience.
The actual method that is called is determined by calling method_for_action.
The actual response object is generated automatically through the use of renders and redirects and requires no user intervention.
The actual return value of scanf when called with a block is an array containing the results of all the executions of the block.
The actual work method for adding converters, used by both CSV.convert() and CSV.header_convert().
The address of the SMTP server to connect to.
The address of the proxy server, if one is configured.
The address of this function
The address to connect to.
The advantage is that you're able to add validations, callbacks, and extra attributes on the join model.
The advantage, though, is that it offers a number of plot and chart types:
The advantages of Qu are: Multiple backends (redis, mongo), jobs are requeued when worker is killed, resque-like API.
The algorithm counts decision points and adds one.
The alias +path_to_image+ is provided to avoid that.
The alias for the active_record's table
The aliases added are: * ATOM * BOOL * BYTE * DWORD * DWORD32 * DWORD64 * HANDLE * HDC * HINSTANCE * HWND * LPCSTR * LPSTR * PBYTE * PDWORD * PHANDLE * PVOID * PWORD * UCHAR * UINT * ULONG * WORD
The allowed range of precision is from 0 to 6")
The alphabet uses '-' instead of '+' and '_' instead of '/'.

The apostrophes in "cats'" and "dogs'" suppress the flagging of these words as potential cross-references, which is necessary for the unit tests.
The application 'a' is installed as part of a gem, and this file is here to facilitate running it.
The application builder allows you to override elements of the application generator without being forced to reverse the operations of the default generator.
The application is also responsible for setting up and executing the booting process.
The application object is also responsible for holding the routes and reloading routes whenever the files change in development.
The application programmer can define custom events to be generated by the "T notify generate" command.
The application's location on the filesystem.
The argument +size+ is the accumulated transferred size in bytes.
The argument _n_ specifies the length of the result string.
The argument _n_ specifies the length, in bytes, of the random number to be generated.
The argument _n_ specifies the length, of the random string to be generated.
The argument can take six forms:
The argument specification and the code to handle it are written in the same place.
The argument string is passed to the block in which it should be converted to the desired class.
The argument to the method can also be an array of fields.
The arguments +args+ are passed along to the summarize method which is called on every option.
The arguments are a list of sockets.
The arguments are interpreted as similar to self.
The arguments must be legal JSON types (string, int, float, nil, true, false, hash or array) or GlobalID::Identification instances.
The array does not include the default namespace declaration, if one exists.
The array form is to be used when the condition input is tainted and requires sanitization.
The array has each value sanitized and interpolated into the SQL statement.
The array is flattened, and all items, including the supplied separator, are HTML escaped unless they are HTML safe, and the returned string is marked as HTML safe.
The array is sorted from children to parents, i.e. the first element has no child and the last node has no parent.
The array is sorted from children to parents.
The array of files and list of directories cannot be changed after FileUpdateChecker has been initialized.
The at_exit handler must be installed before anyone else gets a chance to install their own, that way we can be assured that our exit will be last to run (at_exit stacks).
The attribute is registered only if it defines a new method.
The attribute list of the open tag will also be escaped (for instance, the double-quotes surrounding attribute values).
The attribute name must be a valid method name in Ruby.
The attribute writer is named after the association, which means that in the following example, two new methods are added to your model:
The attributes and options can also be specified as a hash.
The attributes of the element are passed in as a hash, and the body as a no-argument block that evaluates to a String.
The attributes of the element are specified as a hash.
The attributes of the element can be specified as three arguments, +name+, +size+, and +maxlength+.
The attributes of the element can be specified as three arguments, +name+, +value+, and +checked+.
The attributes of the element can be specified as two arguments, +name+ and +value+.
The authenticity token is taken from the meta tag in this case
The autocorrect loop will handle that.
The autofixer will default to `start_of_line`.
The automatic guessing of the inverse association uses a heuristic based on the name of the class, so it may not work for all associations, especially the ones with non-standard names.
The available options are:
The available paths in an engine are:
The bang version of the parse method defaults to the more dangerous values for the _opts_ hash, so be sure only to parse trusted _source_ documents.
The base +Renderer+ class uses its +render+ method to delegate to the renderers.
The base exception for JSON errors.
The basename of the file in the client.
The basic idea for this cop was from the warning of `ruby -cw`:
The basic idea is that each thread checks out a database connection from the pool, uses that connection, and checks the connection back in.
The begin and end could also be braces, but we call the variables do...
The behavior is the same, it returns true if the collection based on the criteria has more than one record.
The behavior is the same, it returns true if the collection based on the criteria is not empty.
The below example shows how you can use this to provide performance introspection in the process:
The best thing to do is dump the stupid DTDs and use XMLSchema instead.
The best way to use this is by doing key-based cache expiration on top of a cache store like Memcached that'll automatically kick out old entries.
The big startup time is in filling the table's Tcl array var.
The biggest improvement over LowSecurity is that MediumSecurity won't install packages that are signed by untrusted sources.
The binary is cross-compiled.
The block form allows you to create potentially complex log messages, but to delay their evaluation until and unless the message is logged.
The block form also waits for the process when it returns.
The block form supports filtering.
The block given to the nested fields_for call will be repeated for each instance in the collection:
The block given will be called with a WEBrick::HTTPRequest with request info and a WEBrick::HTTPResponse which must be filled in appropriately:
The block is called from within a transaction, the object is already locked.
The block is called once for each element of the set, passing the element as parameter.
The block is called repeatedly with two arguments: The first is the option name.
The block is called with a socket and a client_address as an Addrinfo object.
The block is called with the message and its source information.
The block is invoked for each subsentence in preorder manner.
The block is invoked for each subsentence.
The block is invoked with the substituting string.
The block is saved and will be called whenever someone instruments "render":
The block is used to generate spaces.
The block receives _msg_ and _msg_src_.
The block receives two arguments, an instance of the current class and the class to be invoked.
The block should return an Object that can be written to the logging device via +write+.
The block syntax also allows you to customize the part headers if desired:
The block syntax is also useful in providing information specific to a part:
The block takes two arguments, the first is the value paired with its key and the second is the remaining hash of options passed to +render+.
The block version of redirect allows for the easy encapsulation of any logic associated with the redirect in question.
The block will be called with the directive name and the directive parameter:
The block will create, run in and delete a temporary directory.
The body assignment is last, since the loop variable bar has an assignment too.
The body is provided by the passed-in no-argument block
The body of the element is provided by the passed-in no-argument block.
The body of the element is the string returned by the no-argument block passed in.
The body of the html element is supplied as a block.
The boolean argument _padding_ specifies the padding.
The boolean false value is converted to the string false.
The boolean true value is converted to the string true.
The bottom window is a text widget with scrollbar
The box size depends on 'reqheight' and 'reqwidth' of contained widgets.
The built gem includes:
The bundled ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters distinguish unique index constraint errors from other types of database errors by throwing an ActiveRecord::RecordNotUnique exception.
The byte position in the source
The cache contains the following structures:
The cache directory seems like a good place to put patches.
The cache file has not been created because there was a symlink in its path.
The cache is even shared across methods to make it even cheaper to use the macro-added methods without worrying too much about performance at the first go.
The cache is supposed to never expire.
The cache is thus automatically bumped whenever the project updated_at is touched.
The cache key generated from this call will be something like:
The cache key is built with a fingerprint of the sql query, the number of records matched by the query and a timestamp of the last updated record.
The cache responds that it's not valid, which means that new results should normally be collected and saved...
The caching is done using the +cache+ helper available in the Action View.
The call method must accept two arguments, params and request, and return a string.
The call returns the value of the block.
The callback implementation should be restricted to cleaning up caches, etc.
The callback is invoked with an SSLSocket and a server name.
The callback is invoked with the Session for the key exchange, an flag indicating the use of an export cipher and the keylength required.
The callback is unsubscribed automatically after that.
The callback must return an OpenSSL::PKey::DH instance of the correct key length.
The callback must return an SSLContext for the server name or nil.
The callback objects have methods named after the callback called with the record as the only parameter, such as:
The caller can specify what form of storage to use for the session's data with the +database_manager+ option to CGI::Session::new.
The caller is responsible for extracting the session id from the session_id attribute and manually encoding it in URLs and adding it as a hidden input to HTML forms created by other mechanisms.
The caller should care such errors and partial write.
The caller should care such errors.
The calling method must retry the exception to repeat the lookup.
The capitalization of the first word can be turned off by setting the +:capitalize+ option to false (default is true).
The capitalization of the first word can be turned off by setting the optional parameter +capitalize+ to false.
The capture method can be used in ERB templates...
The capture method extracts part of a template as a String object.
The case of explicitly lying about encodings via the normal Rails API should be handled inside Rails.
The category only applies to the item immediately following the comment.
The cause is no longer used so we need not hold a reference to the string
The certificate will be changed every time the server is restarted.
The certificates must be in PEM format.
The chain starts with the target table, but we want to end with it here (makes more sense in this context), so we reverse
The change may add new features, but do so in a way that client software written to an earlier version is still compatible.
The change may be an implementation detail only and have no effect on the client software.
The change may change the public interface of the library in such a way that old software is no longer compatible.
The changed state is then set to +false+.
The channel just acts as a connector between the two parties (the broadcaster and the channel subscriber).
The channel provides the basic structure of grouping behavior into logical units when communicating over the WebSocket connection.
The charset of the response.
The check are based on the presence of flow of control statement in non-final position in *begin*(implicit) blocks.
The check for an existing value should be run from a class that isn't abstract.
The check stops when we reach Object or the end of ancestors tree.
The checkboxes will all have the same +name+ attribute.

The child process may exit before we wait
The children of this node
The cipher text and initialization vector are base64 encoded and returned to you.
The class has a block comment within, so it's not corrected.
The class has to implement a class method _json_create_ that expects a hash as first parameter.
The class is initialized with a stream and can be used to either write a JSON string or an object which can be converted to JSON.
The class methods proxy to said thread local instance.
The class or constant name of the object can be read from the +name+ attribute.
The class provides version or help information if they were requested, and also constructs the railsrc file (used for extra configuration options).
The class returned implements a `run` method that accepts a preloader.
The classic example is a transfer between two accounts where you can only have a deposit if the withdrawal succeeded and vice versa.
The classic example is the use of a header and footer (even though the Action Pack-way would be to use Layouts):
The client SHOULD NOT attempt to match a presented identifier in which the wildcard character comprises a label other than the left-most label (e.g., do not match bar.*.example.net).
The client SHOULD NOT attempt to match a presented identifier where the wildcard character is embedded within an A-label or U-label of an internationalized domain name.
The closing brace of a multi-line array literal must be on the line after the last element of the array.

The closing brace of a multi-line method definition must be on the line after the last parameter of the definition.
The closing brace of a multi-line method definition must be on the same line as the last parameter of the definition.
The closure created by the matcher would otherwise evaluate for `ActiveRecord::Base`, not the sub class being decorated.
The code below is not legal Ruby (Foo must have been defined before Foo.bar is encountered), but RDoc might encounter Foo.bar before Foo if they live in different files.
The code below is not strictly legal Ruby (Foo must have been defined before Foo::Bar is encountered), but RDoc might encounter Foo::Bar before Foo if they live in different files.
The code demonstrates how a multi-protocol client should be written.
The code demonstrates how a multi-protocol daemon should be written.
The code has changed some, but the logic and the source documents are the same.
The code is equivalent to:
The code might look like this:
The coder will be yielded to the block.
The coerce method provides support for Ruby type coercion.
The column number of the current token.

The components accepted are +userinfo+, +host+, +port+, +path+ and +typecode+.
The components accepted are host, port, dn, attributes, scope, filter, and extensions.
The components accepted are userinfo, host, port, path, query and fragment.
The components should be provided either as an Array, or as a Hash with keys formed by preceding the component names with a colon.
The configuration of this DRbServer
The connection is long-lived, so it needs its own set of tags for its independent duration.
The connection pool is "fair" if threads waiting for connections receive them in the order in which they began waiting.
The connection will remain open and active but will no longer be managed by this pool.
The connection will remain open for multiple requests in the block if the server indicates it supports persistent connections.
The connnection should be a Net::HTTP object, and it should have been constructed using the Net::HTTP.Proxy method, but anything that responds to "get" will work.
The constant WidgetsController can be resolved from the name.
The constant is no longer reachable, just skip it.
The constant value and comment will be updated later, when the Ruby parser adds the constant
The constructor accepts a hash as options for parser.
The constructor for the value class is called +create+ and it expects a CIDR address string as a parameter.
The constructor generates set of regexps for parsing URIs.
The content is the declaration itself, unparsed.
The content will be converted to the +encoding+.
The contents are the same, so no corruption of data should occur.
The contents of comments are never modified.
The contents of the file will be shifted to have the same indentation as the ':' at the start of the +:include:+ directive.
The contents of the highest-numbered group matched in the last successful pattern match.
The contents of the nonce are implementation dependent.
The contents of this object vary from event to event, but are identical to the arguments passed to +StreamListener+s for each event.
The context has :+respect_whitespace+ set to :+all+ or an array containing the name of this element, and :+compress_whitespace+ isn't set to :+all+ or an array containing the name of this element.
The context holds information about the processing environment, such as whitespace handling.
The context in which a Resource.stage() occurs.
The controller generator will then try to invoke the following generators:
The controller passes objects to the view by assigning instance variables:
The controller specifies a form builder as its default:
The conversion functions such as NUM2INT uses (conceptually) to_int.
The conversion takes place in the +convert+ method, so you can use the same RDoc::Markup converter to convert multiple input strings.
The conversion will fail if the data cannot be transcoded, leaving the field unchanged.
The conversion will fail if the data cannot be transcoded, leaving the header unchanged.
The cookie is signed by your app's `secrets.secret_key_base` value.
The cookie jar used for storage is automatically configured to be the best possible option given your application's configuration.
The cookies being read are the ones received along with the request, the cookies being written will be sent out with the response.
The cookies of the request that initiated the WebSocket connection.
The cop also reports warnings when you are using 'to_time' method, because it doesn't know about Rails time zone either.
The cop is configurable and the enforce the use of older something_filter methods or the newer something_action methods.
The cop only registers an offense if the extra line is completely empty.
The corresponding relative version, 'sqlite3:foo', is handled elsewhere, as an "opaque".
The counter cache is incremented when an object of this class is created and decremented when it's destroyed.
The counter_cache option must be given on either the owner or inverse association, and the column must be present on the owner.

The current version of RSS
The current working directory during builds.
The current working directory during tests.
The currently installed version for this formula.
The custom FormBuilder class is automatically merged with the options of a nested fields_for call, unless it's explicitly set.
The cycle helper depends on this behavior.
The cycle helpers need to store the cycles in a place that is guaranteed to be reset every time a page is rendered, so it uses an instance variable of ActionView::Base.
The cyclomatic complexity is the number of linearly independent paths through a method.
The data in +class_module+ is preferred over the receiver.
The data is identical to the arguments passed for the various events to the StreamListener API.
The data only persists for as long as the current Ruby interpreter instance does.
The data source must be open for reading.
The data source must be open for writing.
The database still needs to send all the data to Active Record and it still needs to be processed.
The date argument has a format similar to 8-Aug-2002.
The datefield package provides the datefield widget which is an enhanced text entry widget for the purpose of date entry.
The datefield widget is, in fact, just an entry widget with specialized bindings.
The debug and info messages are silently discarded.
The debug level of irb
The declaration can also include an +options+ hash to specialize the behavior of the association.
The declaration creates an additional spec a-2, but no gem for it (so it cannot be installed).
The decrement is performed directly on the underlying attribute, no setter is invoked.
The default 'now'::date is CURRENT_DATE
The default ACL is +nil+.
The default Action View context is ActionView::Base.
The default ConnectionPool maximum size is 5.

The default Multibyte Chars proxy has more features than the normal string implementation.
The default SMTP port number, 25.
The default SMTPS port number, 465.
The default argument is returned if the underlying implementation does not define the indexes method, as there's no way to determine the correct answer in that case.
The default can be changed as follows:
The default can be set to something else in the CGI constructor, via the :max_multipart_length key in the option hash.
The default caption string (heading above the output times).
The default configuration comes from +default+.
The default drb protocol which communicates over a TCP socket.
The default encoding is UTF-8.
The default filter, which is applied when a block is not given, omits optionals and recommendeds based on what the dependent has asked for.
The default format and a sample are shown below:
The default format is ISO 8601.

The latter is a shortcut for:
The latter is used to set the parameter as permitted and limit which attributes should be allowed for mass updating.
The latter method iterates through an array doing regular expression matches, which results in a lot of object creations.

The method +deserialize+ or +cast+ will be called on your type object, with raw input from the database or from your controllers.
The method +file+ returns a +File+ object for the file currently being read.
The method +name+ must exist before stubbing.
The method +to_set+ is added to Enumerable for convenience.

The method arguments are symbols which correspond to the names of the methods which should be unscoped.
The method can also be called with multiple arguments.
The method can be followed by parenthesis (not recommended)
The method can be used in several slightly different ways, depending on how much you wish to rely on Rails to infer automatically from the model how the form should be constructed.
The method enumerates prime numbers infinitely if +ubound+ is nil.
The method for the form defaults to POST.
The method has no block comment inside, but it's within a class that has a block comment, so it's not corrected either.
The method is failed if option processing has already started.
The method is intended to return an ActiveRecord::Relation object, which is composable with other scopes.
The method reference callbacks work by specifying a protected or private method available in the object, like this:
The method reference is the preferred approach to variable layouts and is used like this:
The method removes the basename of the file path and the digest, if any.
The method returns an array of two values.
The method returns the return-value from the Remote Procedure Call.
The method returns true if at least one element is the same.
The method to fetch next token.
The method will also ensure an HTTP Date header for client compatibility.
The method, proc or string should return or evaluate to a +true+ or +false+ value.
The methods are exposed by removing the leading +HTTP_+ (if it exists) and downcasing the name.
The methods below define the formula DSL.
The methods which wrap a form helper call.
The migration version, migration file name, migration class name are available as instance variables in the template to be rendered.

The mixed mode default is to treat a list of indices as row access, returning the rows indicated.
The monkey-patched method here is copied directly from upstream fix.
The month names are presented as keys (what's shown to the user) and the month numbers (1-12) are used as values (what's submitted to the server).
The most common case.
The most common errors are:
The most common usage pattern for this method is probably in a migration, when just after creating a table you want to populate it with some default values, eg:

The next iteration will find the offense again and correct it.
The next line sets the parent.
The next section shows you how to achieve these things.
The next thing that changes in isolated engines is the behavior of routes.

The object is instantiated first, therefore all callbacks and filters are fired off before the object is deleted.
The object returned is a relation, which can be further extended.
The offense on line 4 is corrected, affecting lines 4 to 11.
The offenses that couldn't be corrected will be found again so we only keep the corrected ones in order to avoid duplicate reporting.
The offset is the number of seconds that this time zone is offset from UTC (GMT).
The one-argument form of `tap` :    simplifies but also limits.
The only :    valid version is `v1`.
The only exception in ActiveModel for ActiveRecord is the use of self.build instead of self.new.
The only necessary method to implement is the "perform" method.
The only requirement is that the +model+ parameter be an object that responds to +all+, and returns an array of objects that represent time zones.
The only restriction is that the word must begin with a capital letter.
The only time this isn't true is when an Element is created that is not part of any Document.
The only valid child node for a Psych::Nodes::Stream node is Psych::Nodes::Document.

The optional tag for this mapping
The optional timeout parameter defines, in seconds, the total time to wait for the pattern.
The options are :table_name and :table_name_with_underscore.
The options argument is interpreted to be a hash of header names and values.
The options below give you various choices, in more or less increasing complexity.
The options for atom_feed are:
The options hash is passed to the underlying cache implementation.
The options to pass to Process.spawn are constructed by merging +opts+, the last hash element of the array, and specifications for the pipes between each of the commands.
The options to support are passed to new() as an array of arrays.
The options used when no overrides are given by calling code.
The options version of redirect allows you to supply only the parts of the url which need to change, it also supports interpolation of the path similar to the first example.
The order clause takes precedence over the informed ids
The order in which jobs are processed can be configured differently depending on the adapter.
The order in which mappings are defined determines the order in which attributes are sent to the value class constructor.
The order in which the substitutions occur
The order in which values are removed/returned is not guaranteed.
The order of elements is uncertain.
The order of the mappings will determine the order of the parameters.
The order will depend on the database implementation.
The original exception that was raised during deserialization of job arguments.
The original implementation is provided by H.M.

The output in both cases is a report when the execution is over:
The output is machine-parsable.
The owner is passed as a parameter to the block.
The padding character is optional.
The pair is located as described in CSV::Row.field().
The parameter +addr+ is validated using the first +family+ member, which is +Socket::AF_INET+ or +Socket::AF_INET6+.
The parameter is called MinDigits (meaning the minimum number of digits for which an offense can be registered), but essentially it's a Max parameter (the maximum number of something that's allowed).
The parameter name is the name attribute of the file input field, as usual.
The parameters env, cmd, and opts are passed to Process.spawn.
The parameters for start_document must be this:
The parameters in the signature may have reserved Ruby words, in order to prevent errors, we start each param name with `_`.
The parent +request+ is used to provide diagnostics in case of conflicts.
The parent may be missing for classes loaded from legacy RI data stores.
The parent of top-level and anonymous modules is Object.
The pareto chart mixes line and bar elements in the same graph.
The parsed RDoc::Markup::Document is attached as a file comment.
The parsed argument value is passed to the given block, where it can be processed.
The parsed document is cached until the text is changed.
The parser extracts +yield+ expressions from method bodies to gather the yielded argument names.
The parser extracts the arguments from the method definition.
The parser looks at the token after the identifier to determine the name, in this example, :meta_method.
The parser only handles the block-level constructs Paragraph, List, ListItem, Heading, Verbatim, BlankLine and Rule.
The parser tokenizes an input string then parses the tokens into a Document.
The parser works in the Encoding of the IO or String object being read from or written to.
The parsing core remains quite small.) 3.
The passed-in no-argument block is ignored.
The path is calculated like the +src+ of +image_tag+.
The path typically refers to the absolute path and the opaque part.
The paths are interpreted as relative to dir1 because .rubocop.yml is placed there.
The pattern must respond to +.match+, else ArgumentError is raised.
The payload is a mechanism that allows instrumenters to pass extra information to subscribers.
The penalty for the rest of strings is marginal.
The phrase "Updating salaries..." would then be printed, along with the benchmark for the block when the block completes.
The pixels copied will include the left and top edges of the specified rectangle but not the bottom or right edges.
The plugin builder allows you to override elements of the plugin generator without being forced to reverse the operations of the default generator.
The point of fixtures are that they're stable units of predictable sample data.

The provided +block+ is passed a header and field for each pair in the row and expected to return +true+ or +false+, depending on whether the pair should be deleted.
The provided constant descriptor may be a (non-anonymous) module or class, or a qualified constant name as a string or symbol.
The proxy URI determined from the environment for this connection.

The pseudo-attribute "PRETTY" can be used to specify that the generated HTML string should be indented.
The public controller methods +respond_to+ may be called with a block that is used to define responses to different mime-types, e.g. for +respond_to+ :
The purpose of allowing strings in rescue_from is to support the declaration of handler associations for exception classes whose definition is yet unknown.
The purpose of using base64 to encode data is that it translates any binary data into purely printable characters.
The quality of the implementation depends on a good choice.
The quantifiers don't need to be a continuous sequence
The range of this number is 0-65535.
The raw IPv4 address as a String.
The real benefit of streaming is on expensive actions that, for example, do a lot of queries on the database.
The reason RubyGems refused to install your shiny new signed gem was because it was from an untrusted source.
The reason for doing this is simple -- in `distance_of_time_to_words`, when we take the distance between our two Time objects in seconds and convert it to minutes, we round the number.
The reason for having two modules is that some users aren't interested in complex numbers, and perhaps don't even know what they are.
The reason is that the parent model's type is a column value so its corresponding table name cannot be put in the +FROM+/+JOIN+ clauses of that query.
The reason it can't be implemented as a normal cop is that it depends on the results of all other cops to do its work.
The recall key is only used if there is no key in the options or if the key in the options is identical.
The receiver is not contained within the result.
The recommended style is options Hash style for one or more arguments case.
The reconnection time in milliseconds used when attempting to send the event.
The references are forever, so they won't be released as is normally the case with a controller instance that gets thrown away after every request.
The referrer information is pulled from the HTTP `Referer` (sic) header on the request.
The regex marking a line as a comment.
The regexp that matches blank strings is expensive.
The registered preview interceptors will be informed so that they can transform the message as they would if the mail was actually being delivered.
The registry is stored as a thread local, which is accessed through +ScopeRegistry.current+.
The regular _puts_ and _print_ methods do not operate as expected in an eRuby code block.
The reincarnation of syntax cop :)
The reject_if option is defined by +accepts_nested_attributes_for+.
The remainder of this response is a line of text.
The remaining arguments are used for SMTP authentication, if required or desired.
The remaining logic provides a fake Xcode version for CLT-only systems.
The remaining request parameters, the session (if one is available), and the full request with all the HTTP headers are made available to the action through accessor methods.
The remote_addr used in the last request.
The render call itself will just return a string holding the result of the rendering.
The rendered match is then saved to an accumulator array, and the input string is reduced to the post-match substring.
The replacement should always be a string that may include references to the matched data from the rule.
The request body is an IO input stream.
The request that initiated the WebSocket connection is available here.
The request that the response is responding to.
The request types Net::HTTP supports are listed below in the section "HTTP Request Classes".
The required +precision+ parameter is used to determine the amount of significant digits for the result.
The requirements for implementing ActiveModel::Dirty are:
The resource and all segments will now route to /postings instead of /posts
The resource names should be the import name of the package, e.g. `resource "github.com/foo/bar"`
The response URI is only available if a URI was used to create the request.
The response can be committed multiple times
The response code of the request.
The response is sent to the client after the whole template is rendered, all queries are made, and the layout is processed.
The response that caused this error
The rest is the same.
The rest is unchanged.
The rest is used by rails internally to perform temporary rename operations
The result after rendering is:
The result can be used as an argument for establish_connection, for easily re-establishing the connection.
The result contains 122 random bits (15.25 random bytes).
The result is a kind of sliding window on the data series.
The result is returned as a new TimeWithZone object.
The result is returned or yielded if a block is given.
The result is that when this method returns, the array will contain elements which match the path
The result is the following:
The result may also be smaller than string.length (partial write).
The result may contain 0-9 and a-f.
The result may contain alphanumeric characters except 0, O, I and l
The result of calling `write` when this is `false` is determined by `ignore_disconnect`.
The result will contain both RDoc::ClassModules and Strings.
The result would be the same if we added +:inverse_of+ to our model definitions:
The result, _mesg_, is the data received.
The resulting code will be a Fixnum, for real HTTP codes, and it will be a String for the pseudo-HTTP codes, such as: :success, :missing, :redirect and :error
The resulting object is returned whether the object was saved successfully to the database or not.
The resulting string will be stripped in any case.
The results will be returned as an array with columns requested encapsulated as attributes of the model you call this method from.
The retrieved or created session is automatically added to +request+ as a cookie, and also to its +output_hidden+ table, which is used to add hidden input elements to forms.
The return value is 4-elements array.
The return value is a hash of attributes.
The return value is an array of +Net::IMAP::MailboxList+.

The return value of this method will implement the interface described by ActiveModel::Type::Value (though the object itself may not subclass it).
The return value, _numbytes_sent_ is an integer which is the number of bytes sent.
The return values are used as the +value+ attribute and contents of each check box tag, respectively.
The return values are used as the +value+ attribute and contents of each radio button tag, respectively.
The returned document is a prettier form of the document returned by unparse.
The returned relation implements the Null Object pattern.
The returned string is also extended by OpenURI::Meta.
The returned value from this method should be a +String+, +Numeric+, +Date+, +Time+, +Symbol+, +true+, +false+, or +nil+.
The reverse of +camelize+.
The reverse of +pluralize+, returns the singular form of a word in a string.
The rightmost argument to +form_for+ is an optional hash of options -
The root directory where the formula's manual pages should be installed.
The root node reflects the class name of the first element in plural if all elements belong to the same type and that's not Hash:
The route key also considers if the noun is uncountable and, in such cases, automatically appends _index.
The routing module provides URL rewriting in native Ruby.
The row is simply removed with an SQL +DELETE+ statement on the record's primary key, and no callbacks are executed.
The ruby version can be specified to the patch-level:
The rule can either be a string or a regular expression.
The rule for modification is a simple one.
The rules are different than for Ruby, so we cannot use eval.
The rules for duplicated keys follow the semantics of indifferent access:
The rules used to do the guess are handled by the Inflector class in Active Support, which knows almost all common English inflections.
The safe level for this server.
The same as +content_for+ but when used with streaming flushes straight back to the layout.
The same as FileSystemResolver but does not allow templates to store a virtual path since it is invalid for such resolvers.
The same instance variables defined in the action are passed to all email templates.
The same item is described across the +searchIndex+, +longSearchIndex+ and +info+ fields.
The same record may be represented in the persisted array and in the memory array.
The sample usage code given above follows this practice.
The savepoint is now gone and we can't remove it again.
The scalar may have an +anchor+, a +tag+, be implicitly +plain+ or implicitly +quoted+
The scan method is then called to parse the file and must return the RDoc::TopLevel object.

The scope of the eval-block of 'eval_proc' method is different from the enternal.
The scope of the eval-block of 'eval_proc' method is different from the external.
The scrollbar must be managed by either pack or grid, other geometry managers are not supported.

The session id is a secure random number by SecureRandom if possible, otherwise an SHA512 hash based upon the time, a random number, and a constant string.
The session must have been previously connected.
The session should not be used, however, as a cache for objects where it's likely they could be changed unknowingly.
The set of all prime numbers.

The specification is yielded for customization.
The specification will be yielded before creation for customization, but only the block or the dependencies may be set, not both.
The specification will be yielded before gem creation for customization, but only the block or the dependencies may be set, not both.
The specification will be yielded before gem creation for customization.
The specification's set will be the current set, and the source will be the current set's source.
The specifications in the returned array will be considered in reverse order, so the latest version ought to be last.
The specifics differ between databases.
The specified URL will then be passed a File object containing the selected file, or if the field was left blank, a StringIO object.
The stack backtrace generated by the last exception.
The standard CGI environmental variables are available as read-only attributes of a CGI object.
The standard library supports RSS 0.91, 1.0, 2.0, and Atom, a related format.
The standard set of helper methods for form building are located in the +field_helpers+ class attribute.
The stdlib recorded in the install receipt is used during dependency compatibility checks, so we only care about the stdlib that libraries link against.
The store manages reading and writing ri data for a project and maintains a cache of methods, classes and ancestors in the store.
The stream is the root of the tree.
The stream is valid only in the block, and has these methods:
The string following the match in the last successful pattern match.
The string form can be used for statements that don't involve tainted data.

The t0.nsec is 789000000 and t1.nsec is 789000465 because of error range by conversion Time between VT_DATE Variant.
The table names appear in alphabetical order.
The table style is the only one where the first key-value pair can be considered to have bad alignment.
The tables for these classes could look something like:
The tag name for this sequence (if any)
The tag value (if there is one)
The target is stale if the target no longer points to the record(s) that the relevant foreign_key(s) refers to.
The target method must be public, otherwise it will raise +NoMethodError+.
The tasks defined here are used with Rake tasks provided by Active Record.
The template digest that's added to the cache key is computed by taking an md5 of the contents of the entire template file.
The template supports 4 expansions:
The temporary file will be placed in the directory as specified by the +tmpdir+ parameter.
The test adapter should be used only in testing.
The test case uses minitest, so all the assertions of minitest may be used.
The test helpers are responsible for setting up the queue, subscriptions and turning colors in logs off.
The test will fail if it returns false, or if an exception is raised.
The test will have the following name:
The testcase provides the following:
The tested hosts are explained in detail here: https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/commit/5e16a5428f973667cabfa07e94ff939e7a83ebd9
The testing environment will automatically load the all fixtures into the database before each test.
The text +sep+ is inserted if a line is not broken at this point.
The text for parts of this document, especially the Description and Conversions sections, above, were adapted from the Linux Programmer's Manual manpage for scanf(3), dated 1995-11-01.
The text is appended in the +raw+ mode of this text node.
The text may be prefixed by the response code.
The third argument is the actual data, a map represented as an array of two-element arrays.
The third argument, +indent_empty_lines+, is a flag that says whether empty lines should be indented.
The third argument, 2, limits derivation to restrict results finitely.
The third element is the value of the token for :val and :str, otherwise it is the lexeme.
The third field denotes the 'General' category, e.g. Lu
The third form of +add_handler is to use XMLRPC::Service::Interface to generate an object, which represents an interface (with signature and help text) for a handler class.
The third is an inbound interface index.
The thread has a pid method and a thread variable :pid which is the pid of the started process.
The thread pool size maxes out at 4 worker threads by default.
The thread to receive exceptions.
The three digit reply code of the SMTP response
The through record (built with build_record) is temporarily cached so that it may be reused if insert_record is subsequently called.
The time is parsed using Time.parse method.
The timezone can be either :local or :utc (default :local).
The timezone used is GMT.
The title and parsed comment are saved, but not the section parent which must be restored manually.
The title following +:section:+ is used as the section name and the remainder of the comment containing the section is used as introductory text.
The token can include the "Negotiate" header and it will be stripped.
The top level domain can be any string without a period or **.**, ***.** style TLDs like co.uk or com.au
The top-level binding or, optional +bind+ parameter will be used when creating the workspace.
The total accumulated defects is displayed with a single line element.
The total number of irb sessions, used to set +irb_name+ of the current Context.
The total width of the objects included in this Text object.
The transactional behavior ensures that any changes succeed or fail together.
The translated model name, translated attribute name and the value are available for interpolation.
The transport layer is managed by DRb::DRbProtocol.
The transport layer is responsible for opening client and server network connections and forwarding dRuby request across them.
The trick with the ttk::frame makes the text widget look like it fits with the current Ttk theme despite not being a themed widget itself.
The two are compared first on their offsets, and then by name.
The two main methods for testing your routes:
The two-element version omits either the option value (defaults to the same as the display text) or the boolean selected specifier (defaults to false).
The type detected by Active Record can be overridden.
The type for the numeric depends on the width of the field, so we'll do something special here.
The type of an attribute is given the opportunity to change how dirty tracking is performed.
The type of the return-value is one of the types shown above.
The type of this event.
The type used to get this primitive should have been provided before reaching the connection adapter.
The typical filter use case is to remove lengthy path information from the start of each line, and view file paths relevant to the app directory instead of the file system root.
The typical route is to just dump everything in a monolithic class, perhaps with a comment, as a least-bad alternative.
The typical silencer use case is to exclude the output of a noisy library from the backtrace, so that you can focus on the rest.
The underlying body, as a streamable object.
The underlying class variable is set to +nil+, if it is not previously defined.
The underlying implementation is the libyaml wrapper Psych.
The underlying per-thread class variable is set to +nil+, if it is not previously defined.
The uninstaller fires pre and post uninstall hooks.
The unique request id can be used to trace a request end-to-end and would typically end up being part of log files from multiple pieces of the stack.
The unit of time is seconds.
The unusual part of its implementation is that it doesn't have any on_* methods or an investigate method.
The updated template should be picked since lookup_context generated a new key after we changed the locale.
The upper bound of enumeration.
The upside of long-lived channel instances is that you can use instance variables to keep reference to objects that future subscriber requests can interact with.
The upwards search is stopped at this level.
The use of this method should be restricted to complicated SQL queries that can't be executed using the ActiveRecord::Calculations class methods.
The user can override this default by passing a block to the layout:
The user can specify the encoding using Ruby-style encoding comments in any template engine.
The user does not generally need to call it directly.
The user does not have to directly deal with this object in normal use.
The user does not normally need to deal with it directly.
The user has defined their own default scope method, so call that
The user is informed by a warning like: "unknown OID 5653508: failed to recognize type of 'address'.
The usual skip of leading white space is suppressed.
The valid arguments are given in VALID_UNSCOPING_VALUES.
The validators hash can also handle regular expressions, ranges, arrays and strings in shortcut form.
The value is returned with the same data type of the column, +0+ if there's no row.
The value is returned with the same data type of the column, or +nil+ if there's no row.
The value is the accessor to which the methods will be delegated.
The value is truncated word by word.
The value of :nameserver should be an address string or an array of address strings.
The value of :nameserver_port should be an array of pair of nameserver address and port number.
The value of the block is returned.
The value of this is to be an Array of pairs:
The value returned from calling +method+ on the instance +object+ will be selected.
The value that is appended to +output+ to add a new line.
The value type is REG_SZ(write_s), REG_DWORD(write_i), or REG_BINARY(write_bin).
The values are passed to the connector for quoting, but the caller is responsible for ensuring they are enclosed in quotes in the resulting SQL.
The values are returned in reverse order of their inclusion, which is the order suitable for searching methods/attributes in the ancestors.
The values are unchanged.
The values compared should be of fixed length, such as strings that have already been processed by HMAC.
The variable foo belongs to the top level scope, but in AST, it's under the block node.
The variable is local to the current scope.
The variable is set to the contents of +fields+.
The various connection pools are managed by a single instance of ConnectionHandler accessible via ActiveRecord::Base.connection_handler.
The verbatim block is shifted left (the least indented lines start in column 0).
The version 4 UUID is purely random (except the version).
The version column used for optimistic locking.
The version is Psych you're using
The version is autodetected from the URL and/or tag so only needs to be declared if it cannot be autodetected correctly.
The version number in which the deprecated behavior will be removed, by default.
The version number of a specification that does not specify one (i.e. RubyGems 0.7 or earlier).
The version of Gem::Resolver::Molinillo.
The version of libyaml Psych is using
The version of the YAML document
The version of the installed library.
The version string can contain numbers and periods, such as +1.0.0+.
The very last line of +activerecord/lib/active_record/base.rb+ is:
The view_paths array must be set on Base and not LayoutTest so that LayoutTest's inherited method has access to the view_paths array when looking for a layout to automatically assign.
The weight field specifies a relative weight for entries with the same priority.
The whole block will be called in the right order within the migration.
The whole info structure parsed from the JSON
The width of +obj+ / +sep+
The word will be pluralized using rules defined for the locale (you must define your own inflection rules for languages other than English).
The worker pool is an executor service that's backed by a pool of threads working from a task queue.
The worker pool is where we run connection callbacks and channel actions.
The workflow is to append a PrettyPrint::Text object to the buffer, and being able to call the buffer.last() to reference it.
The writer adapter class
Their main advantage is that the macros add behavior into a callback queue that is kept intact down through an inheritance hierarchy.
Then arbitrary gemspecs will be returned until the circular dependency is broken, after which gems will be returned in dependency order again.
Then consistency is checked only within each section delimited by a modifier node.
Then create a server that does not listen by default:
Then define a list of methods that you want callbacks attached to:
Then drop privileges:
Then evaluates the given expressions using the +:XMP+ prompt mode.
Then in the view any form using +form_for+ will be an instance of the specified form builder:
Then in your class, you can use the +before_create+, +after_create+ and +around_create+ methods, just as you would in an Active Record model.
Then overwrite the listening sockets with the port 80 sockets:
Then the action is performed.
Then the cop treats it as an `if`/`elsif`/`elsif`...
Then the holder of issued certificate (in this case, your buddy "drbrain"), can start using this signed certificate to sign RubyGems.
Then the new value is appended to that Array.
Then touch /var/log/my_program.log and signal syslogd with a HUP (killall -HUP syslogd, on FreeBSD).
Then we can skip decode+encode if we're just proxying messages.
Then you can directly open the ActionPack documentation by typing 'rdoc actionp'.
Then you can send messages.
Then you must prepare the parse entry method.
Then your library can be eager loaded by simply calling:
Then, enter the Ruby expression.
Then, if you want webrat to be invoked, just supply:
Then, in another template or layout, this code would render both links in order:
Then, in another template or layout, this code would render only the last link:
Then, in another view, you could to do something like this:
Then, in the action, we extract the company data from the request, find or create the company, and then create the new person with the remaining data.
Then, one asserts whether the current state is as expected.
There are a couple of problems with self-signed certificates: first of all, self-signed certificates don't offer a whole lot of security.
There are a few caveats with this module.
There are a few differences between this parser and the specification.
There are a few variables in every Irb session that can come in handy:
There are also some additional HTML generation methods mixed in from the CGI::HtmlExtension module.
There are also some special options: - `:universal`: build a universal binary/library (e.g. on newer Intel Macs this means a combined x86_64/x86 binary/library).
There are also two ways to define handler, the first is like C/PHP, the second like Java, of course both ways can be mixed:
There are cops/forces that require their own custom processing.
There are few implementations of generator.
There are four types of callbacks accepted by the callback macros: Method references (symbol), callback objects, inline methods (using a proc), and inline eval methods (using a string).
There are multiple TimeZone objects per time zone, in many cases, to make it easier for users to find their own time zone.
There are multiple cache store implementations, each having its own additional features.
There are multiple implementations of MPI-2 available.
There are nineteen callbacks in total, which give you immense power to react and prepare for each state in the Active Record life cycle.
There are no statically declared interfaces for remote objects, such as CORBA's IDL.
There are no tests for this behavior in lint because it doesn't make sense to force any of the possible implementation strategies on the implementer.
There are other Source subclasses for installed gems, local gems, the bundler dependency API and so-forth.
There are queries that you can't execute inside a transaction though, and for these situations you can turn the automatic transactions off.
There are several candidate uses: * text formatting using proportional fonts * multibyte characters which has columns different to number of bytes * non-string formatting
There are several connection-pooling-related options that you can add to your database connection configuration:
There are several interesting features that Logger provides, like auto-rolling of log files, setting the format of log messages, and specifying a program name in conjunction with the message.
There are some GUI tools such as GTranslator.

There are two ways to activate Profiling:
There are two ways to build a many-to-many relationship.
There are two ways to call this method, with a block, or without a block.
There are two ways to mitigate this problem.
There are two ways to unsubscribe.
There are two ways to use the fixtures, but first let's take a look at a sample unit test:
There can be a '::' in front of class names to reference from the top-level namespace.
There can be multiple .rubocop.yml files in subdirectories, but we just look at the current working directory
There could be a custom cop with this name.
There is a bug on my Win98 box with Tk_MeasureChars() and MS Sans Serif 8.
There is a known issue with the listen tests that causes files to be incorrectly GC'ed even when they are still in-use.
There is a special syntactic shortcut to generate migrations that add fields to a table.
There is also a list of default options supported by every validator: +:if+, +:unless+, +:on+ and +:strict+.
There is also a list of default options supported by every validator: +:if+, +:unless+, +:on+, +:allow_nil+, +:allow_blank+, and +:strict+ .
There is also a list of default options supported by every validator: +:if+, +:unless+, +:on+, +:allow_nil+, +:allow_blank+, and +:strict+.
There is also a list of options that could be used along with validators:
There is also the Net::HTTPBadResponse exception which is raised when there is a protocol error.
There is an additional symbol that can be listened for: :progress.
There is currently no way to differentiate between which source it came from.
There is no default :DirectoryCallback:: Allows preprocessing of directory requests.
There is no default callback.
There is no gurantee that this thread has received all the responses, so check the response length.
There is no implied ordering so if order matters, you should specify it yourself.
There is no need to implement a special interface, or mixin special functionality.
There is no need to set this in your gem specification.
There is no standard output or return code, but it should :    generally indicate to the user if something is wrong with the installed :    formula.
There is no way to do this automatically since it can be set on a superclass
There is no way to generate time string with arbitrary timezone.
There is normally no need to replace this component, and no direct way is provided to do so.
There is plenty of detail there to use the client and implement a server.
There is strange, dark magic at work in this code.
There must be no whitespace before an XML declaration transitive:: Ignored ie_hack:: Ignored
There should be no good reason to do this since Matrices are immutable.
There were two trailing blank lines right above this paragraph, that have been removed.
There will be one checkbox for each value.
There would be false positives otherwise.
There would be no multibyte character used as shell meta-character that needs to be escaped.
There's a short-hand method for each of the type values declared at the top.
There's also +insert_after+ which will insert a middleware after another:
There's also a convenience method for rendering sub templates within the current controller that depends on a single object (we call this kind of sub templates for partials).
There's also a related idiom that uses the splat operator:
There's an auto-redirect here, but this mistake is incredibly common too.
There's an implicit variable reference by the zero-arity `super`:
There's enough special stuff around it that it may justify a separate class.
There's no existing data for CSV to use to prepare itself and thus you will probably need to manually specify the desired Encoding for most of those cases.
There's no limit to the depth of the nesting.
Therefore test_invalid column should always return true even if the type is not valid.
Therefore the primary key must be orderable, e.g an integer or a string.
Therefore the sti column value will still be the same.
Therefore, in XML, "local-name()" is identical (and actually becomes) "local_name()"
Therefore, in non-strict mode, we want column.default to report an empty string as its default, to be consistent with that.
Therefore, it won't work with instances of classes that do not have +Object+ among their ancestors, like direct subclasses of +BasicObject+.
Therefore, once a value is added to the enum array, its position in the array must be maintained, and new values should only be added to the end of the array.
Therefore, we have to offset the bounds by one.
Therefore, we need to parse and re-dump the raw value here to ensure the insignificant whitespaces are consistent with our encoder's output.
Therefore, you are _not_ expected to instantiate this yourself.

These are named after the class specified, so for the above example the helper is either +some_rack_app_path+ or +some_rack_app_url+.
These are necessary to protect objects from GC.
These are not listed in UnicodeData.txt so we must derive them by looking for 'holes' in the range of listed codepoints.

They are especially useful for generating XML content.
They are in any case removed from the collection.
They are left here for the time being to allow ri to operate.
They are made up of one or more actions that are executed on request and then either it renders a template or redirects to another action.
They are mostly used for migrating non-`with` options (e.g. `enable-debug`) to `with` options (e.g. `with-debug`).
They are not appropriate for specific time zone such as Europe/London because time zone neutral, So -00:00 and -0000 are treated as UTC.
They are not recommended if you are performing many HTTP requests.
They are passed to block-arguments.
They are searched from right to left, from bottom to top, and up the hierarchy.

They can't be used for responses that must be byte-identical, like serving Range requests within a PDF file.
They default to require clients to validate with the server before releasing cached responses.

They get help with adding offenses for the faulty string nodes, and with filtering out nodes.
They happen if there are headers with the same text.
They must be less indented.
They must be set in the constructor.

They will however still be marked for destruction.
They will receive the corrector itself and should use its method to modify the source.
They would rather have Math.sqrt(-1) raise an exception than return a complex number.
They're a tad confusing, so here is how the dependency specifiers work:
They're useless and will never be added, so don't bother.
Things that aren't tested elsewhere
Things that have markup suppressed
Think of creating routes as drawing a map for your requests.
Third configurable block to run.
This  allows  one  to  provide  a  wrapper  around a function in another shared library.
This (default configure options) is NOT same the following.
This *class* is a module for backward compatibility.
This + is not a unary operator.
This :    is done automatically when you install formulae but can be useful for DIY :    installations.
This AST is exactly the same as the AST used when parsing a YAML document.
This Class is implemented as subclass of Array which includes the MonitorMixin module.
This DRbObject's remote object will be the server's front object.
This Hash holds the built-in converters of CSV that can be accessed by name.
This Hash holds the built-in header converters of CSV that can be accessed by name.
This Hash is intentionally left unfrozen and users should feel free to add values to it that can be accessed by all CSV objects.
This Hash maps a method name to a list of unmatched aliases (aliases of a method not yet encountered).
This String will be transcoded into the data's Encoding before parsing.
This above is achieved by:
This abstracts the setup and rendering into a separate classes for partials and templates.
This acts as a sort of proxy for the remote object.
This adapter may also present failed instances of the job class that can be restarted.
This adds +obj+ as a text of +width+ columns in width.
This adds only public instance methods explicitly declared in class MyHandler (and not those inherited from any other class).

This all happens inside a transaction, _if_ the Transactions module is included into ActiveRecord::Base after the AutosaveAssociation module, which it does by default.
This allows RubyGems to prefer gems from dependency lock files.
This allows a "loose" upgrade, which, being less strict, prevents some classes of deadlocks.

This allows us to run `rails server` from other directories, but still get the main config.ru and properly set the tmp directory.
This allows using AS::DescendantsTracker without AS::Dependencies.
This allows you to add visual cues to the section.
This allows you to create forms that set or change the attributes of a parent object and its associations in one go.
This allows you to create potentially expensive logging messages that are only called when the logger is configured to show them.

This allows you to modify the application's middlewares from Engines.
This allows you to run multiple RingServers on the same host:
This allows you to specify that associated records should be deleted when the owner is deleted.
This allows you to use the same format for links in views and controllers.
This also allows us to skip checking against two and three.
This also applies to MySQL apps but not with SQLite
This also means that this method only works when the primary key is orderable (e.g. an integer or string).

This policy is basically useless.
This policy is better than nothing, but can still be easily spoofed, and is not recommended.
This portion of the standard library provides tooling to read and create these feeds.
This preserves your current binary send mode, but allows a temporary transaction with binary sendmode of +newmode+.

This special dependency ensures that the Tigerbrew ld64 formula is used as gcc's ld in place of the old version that comes with the OS.
This special version of the main function is only used for the top level the reason for it is basically to force a particular ordering on how the rotations are tested for the first piece.

This was resolved in Ruby HEAD after the release of 1.9.3p194, but never backported into the 1.9.3 branch.
This was the default for Rails 3 apps.
This way it looks nicer.

This will allow clients to submit requests without having to specify any root elements.
This will allow you to specify a text which will displayed instead by using this form:
This will also require 'uri' so you don't need to require it separately.
This will also run validations and callbacks of associated object(s).
This will assign "weblog_standard" as the WeblogController's layout for all actions except for the +rss+ action, which will be rendered directly, without wrapping a layout around the rendered view.

This will make the wrapped hash accessible from controller and view
This will match if, case, begin, blocks, etc.
This will merge the existing object (reply) with what gets loaded from the db (which includes the changed approved attribute).
This will not affect other platforms:
This will not only eliminate the need for you to manually copy the source files into the same directory as your build script, but it also sets the proper +target_prefix+ in the generated Makefile.
This will occur when the mailbox is closed or expunged.
This will often result in a performance improvement over a simple join.
This will only complain when the number of variables being assigned matched the number of assigning variables.

This will perform a diff and delete/add only records that have changed.
This will print an options summary.
This will provide access to fixture data for every table that has been loaded through fixtures (depending on the value of +use_instantiated_fixtures+).

This will use +asset_path+ internally, so most of their behaviors will be the same.
This will use +audio_path+ internally, so most of their behaviors will be the same.
This will use +font_path+ internally, so most of their behaviors will be the same.
This will use +image_path+ internally, so most of their behaviors will be the same.
This will use +javascript_path+ internally, so most of their behaviors will be the same.
This will use +stylesheet_path+ internally, so most of their behaviors will be the same.

This will use TCP for all remaining candidates (assuming the current candidate does not already respond successfully via TCP).
This will validate the association itself, not the id.
This will work with any template engine, as we process out the encoding comment before passing the source on to the template engine, leaving a blank line in its stead.
This won't be the right warning if we matched nothing at all
This work flow assumes that you are a translator for Japanese.
This work flow uses gettext gem because it is more portable than GNU gettext for Rubyists.
This works by using a type column in addition to a foreign key to specify the associated record.
This works for mysql2 where table.column can be used to resolve ambiguity.
This works on MySQL and PostgreSQL.
This works, but it would be better if we formatted the output ourselves.
This would allow a user to use new nonce without prompting the user again for their username and password.
This would also work, but the Tk scale widgets in the right hand pane cause some interference when in autoincrement/indeterminate mode.
This would cause a warning to be printed on stderr if the file was read.
This would render "advertiser/_account.html.erb".
This write will block, and eventually raise
This writes out the entire XML document, including XML declarations, doctype declarations, and processing instructions (if any are given).
This, the default implementation, uses an object's local ObjectSpace __id__ as its id.
Those are used at  TkComm._genobj_for_tkwidget method.
Those points are going to be addressed soon.
Those will not be the ultimate client IP in production, and so are discarded.
Threadsafe template cache
Threadsafe, fair, FIFO queue.
Three modes are supported through the `AlignWith` configuration parameter:
Three or more dashes are considered to be a rule and ignored.
Through RubyGemTestCase you can install and uninstall gems, fetch remote gems through a stub fetcher and be assured your normal set of gems is not affected.
Through association (uses the :primary_key option from the source reflection)
Through associations can either use the has_many or has_one macros.
Through the use of eager loading, the number of queries will be reduced from 101 to 2.
Thrown exceptions are propagated back to the parent process over a pipe
Thus CSV will return Arrays or Rows of Strings in the Encoding of your data.
Thus it is possible to reliably identify an attribute even if an XML processor has changed the prefix.
Thus the string is "eaten" from the left as the FormatSpecifiers are applied in sequence.
Thus this test prepares waiting threads and then trickles in available connections slowly, ensuring the wakeup order is correct in this case.
Thus, any mass-assignment idiom like
Thus, given +words+ is "car" and "cone", the keys pointing to "car" would be "ca" and "car", while those pointing to "cone" would be "co", "con", and "cone".
Thus, if the function is called from the main program, all the shared libraries are searched.
Thus, there is no ways to access the OptionParser object via the receiver object.
Thus, warnings MUST NOT be suppressed.
Thus, we lazy load it and disable warnings locally.
Thus, you won't be able to verify the results of your transaction until Active Record supports nested transactions or savepoints (in progress).
Tiger doesn't ship expat in /usr/lib
Tiger doesn't ship with apple-gcc42, and this is required to build some software that doesn't build properly with FSF GCC.

Time at which this cookie expires, as a +Time+
Time serialization/deserialization
Time to give our monkey some fruit.
Time.at can be called with a time or numerical value
Time.new can be called with a time zone offset When it is, that should be considered safe Example: Time.new(1988, 3, 15, 3, 0, 0, "-05:00")
Time.rfc2822(date) rescue Time.parse(date) Time.httpdate(date) rescue Time.parse(date) Time.xmlschema(date) rescue Time.parse(date)
TimeWithZone instances implement the same API as Ruby Time instances, so that Time and TimeWithZone instances are interchangeable.
Timeout handlers should be managed by using the class methods which are synchronized.
Timeout long-running blocks
Timeout provides a way to auto-terminate a potentially long-running operation if it hasn't finished in a fixed amount of time.
TimeoutHandler is since 1.9
Timer id conversion keeps objects alive for a certain amount of time after their last access.

To solve this fault an enhancement to the rule is that if we have a choice of squares with an equal score, we should choose the one nearest the edge of the board.
To solve this, a 3 second heartbeat runs on all connections.
To specialize the default behavior (i.e., show a login link rather than just the plaintext link text), you can pass a block that accepts the name or the full argument list for +link_to_unless+.

To start, here's an Htpasswd database for use with a DigestAuth authenticator:
To support these, we must use a subquery.
To switch features on/off: `"with-something"` or `"with-otherthing"`.
To take advantage of these options, install the +actionview-encoded_mail_to+ gem.
To test query strings you must use the extras argument, appending the query string on the path directly will not work.

Using +OrderedOptions+, the above code could be reduced to:
Using +true+ also means that redirections between http and ftp are permitted.
Using ::wrap is recommended, see the ::wrap documentation for documentation of +io+ and +digests+.
Using Active Record, Redis, etc within your channel actions means you'll get a separate connection from each thread in the worker pool.
Using Date.today is dangerous, because it doesn't know anything about Rails time zone.
Using ERB, actual Ruby code can be added to any plain text document for the purposes of generating document information details and/or flow control.
Using SMTP.start with a block is the simplest way to do this.
Using a case statement you can handle various types of responses properly:
Using a constant means that we do not have to allocate an object on each call to the attribute method.
Using a label window to control a group of options.
Using either of these alternate methods incurs a performance hit, as the fixtured data must be fully traversed in the database to create the fixture hash and/or instance variables.
Using explicit id in insert for compatibility across all databases
Using it, you can change the label and check box display order or even use the label as wrapper, as in the example above.
Using it, you can change the label and radio button display order or even use the label as wrapper, as in the example above.
Using modules in separate files means tedious sifting to get a big-picture view.
Using pluralization (Ten/Tens and Tenth/Tenths)
Using polymorphic associations in combination with single table inheritance (STI) is a little tricky.
Using self.x to distinguish from local variable x
Using sub templates allows you to sidestep tedious replication and extract common display structures in shared templates.
Using the first composite notifier object you create, sibling notifiers can be initialized with def_notifier.
Using the multiline modifier will raise an +ArgumentError+.
Using the route above, the URL "http://localhost:3000/articles/2005/11/06" maps to
Using this method means you won't directly depend on the ActiveSupport's JSON implementation, in case it changes in the future.
Using this on non-JSON values will open up serious XSS vulnerabilities.
Using this rule it is possible to get to a position where there are no squares available to move into.
Usually a database-dependent operation.
Usually key value pairs are handled something like this:
Usually the place to setup any streams you want this channel to be sending to the subscriber.
Usually there will be carriage return characters on all or none of the lines in a file, so we report only one offense.
Usually this is called by super from a subclass.
Usually this means that the iconv library is not installed.
Usually this model is not saved to the database.
Usually, it's synced with a remote git repository.
Usually, the 'key' will not be a widget option.

WEBrick also includes tools for daemonizing a process and starting a process at a higher privilege level and dropping permissions.
WEBrick can act as a proxy server:
WEBrick can be run as a production server for small loads.
WEBrick can be started as one user to gain permission to bind to port 80 or 443 for serving HTTP or HTTPS traffic then can drop these permissions for regular operation.
WEBrick can separately log server operations and end-user access.
WEBrick features complete logging of both server operations and HTTP access.
WEBrick includes servlets for handling CGI scripts, ERB pages, Ruby blocks and directory listings.
WEBrick is an HTTP server toolkit that can be configured as an HTTPS server, a proxy server, and a virtual-host server.
WEBrick provides both Basic and Digest authentication for regular and proxy servers.

Warn if nothing was replaced
Warning log level which indicates a possible problem
Warning: This class mutates ARGV because some commands require manipulating it before they are run.
Warning: this method modifies the +list+ parameter.
Warnings are issued when dependencies are open-ended or overly strict for semantic versioning.
We accept blank origin headers because some user agents don't send it.
We add 2 because there's one char of padding at both sides, note the extra hyphens in the example above.
We allow multiple spaces here for compatibility with older WEBrick versions.
We allow non-Homebrew installs whenever possible.
We allow separate start and end tags for flexibility
We allow uses of `self` with operators because it would be awkward otherwise.
We already attempted to install f as part of the dependency tree of another formula.
We already attempted to upgrade f as part of the dependency tree of another formula.
We already have one so the existing record will be returned.
We also need to ensure that associations are readonly where relevant.
We also need to reset the runtime before each action because of queries in middleware or in cases we are streaming and it won't be cleaned up by the method below.
We also want to avoid double reporting of offenses checked by the MultilineBlockChain cop.
We always want to persist the locking version, even if we don't detect a change from the default, since the database might have no default
We are able to call the methods like this:
We are also defining a constant to hold the frozen string of the attribute name.
We are fine if the executable does not error out, so we know linking and building the software was ok.
We are given a source with an encoding of ASCII-8BIT
We are going to assign to existing constants on purpose, so silence warnings.
We are not using DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS because that syntax is only supported by pg 9.X
We are only testing that there are no errors because it's too hard to test serializable.
We are running without transactional tests and need to cleanup.
We are specifying a specific set of arguments (CODES and CODE_ALIASES - notice the latter is a Hash), and the user may provide the shortest unambiguous text.
We are testing that a dirty read does not happen
We are testing that a nonrepeatable read does not happen
We assume that the name of the module reflects the nesting (unless it can be proven that is not the case) and the path to the file that defines the constant.
We assume these things about the IP headers:
We basically never want a connection to go stale, as you then can't rely on being able to communicate with the connection.
We basically take the whole thing as one big comment.
We call it semantic alignment when a dot is aligned with the first dot in a chain of calls, and that first dot does not begin its line.
We can accept URIs and strings that begin with http://, https:// and ftp://.
We can also add our own coercions, which we will cover soon.
We can also pass in the symbol arguments instead of strings.
We can also use our own object.
We can drop if dragged item isn't an ancestor
We can improve upon the situation further by referencing both associations in the finder with:
We can not delete the `default' value.
We can then convert the tree to YAML:
We can then redefine how certain data types may be handled in the schema dumper on the Adapter level by over-writing this code inside the database specific adapters
We can use session-oriented authentication for these types of requests, by using the `protect_from_forgery` method in our controllers.
We can use the lookup method like so:
We can use the same cached proxy object because the id is available for the scope
We can't cache Post.find_by(author: david) ...yet
We can't cache results from code which is piped in to stdin
We can't include both ndbm.h and gdbm.h because they both define datum type.
We can't reuse the connection, but we can copy the specification and establish a new connection with it.
We can't silence plain ruby Logger cause with thread safety but at least we don't break it
We can't simply check the first line of the backtrace, because JRuby reports the call to __send__ in the backtrace.
We can't solve the general case, but we can handle most occurrences by ignoring a do at the end of a line.
We can't transcode to the same format, so we choose a nearly-identical encoding.
We can't use alias_method here, because method 'id' optimizes itself on the fly.
We can't use the instance variable inside the lambda.
We cannot use the name "HTTPServerError", it is the name of the response.
We care if the block start with arguments and the expression start on the same line.
We care only for the last argument.
We cheat here and dump everything into the same bucket.
We check that optimization here.
We contain the common stuff for contexts (which are containers) and other elements (methods, attributes and so on)
We corrected some errors.
We could document them using
We currently support NilClass, Fixnum, Float, String, TrueClass, FalseClass, Bignum, BigDecimal, and objects that can be represented as GlobalIDs (ex: Active Record).
We currently use Bareiss' multistep integer-preserving gaussian elimination (see comments on determinant)
We detected that we should activate b-2, so we did so, but then original_require decided "I've already got benchmark.rb" loaded.
We do as little as possible on the server's main thread.
We do this so that if later on YAML, etc are redefined, we've still got a consistent place to find the DefaultKey class for comparison.
We document the request and response methods here because albeit they are implemented in ActionController::Metal, the type of the returned objects is unknown at that level.
We don't know if the first semicolon on the line is a separator of expressions.
We don't know which came from the proxy, and which from the user
We don't need strict fairness: if two connections become available at the same time, it's fine if two threads that were waiting acquire the connections out of order.
We don't own this job so we will update the locked_by name and the locked_at
We don't really handle any of these since we're not a validating parser, so we can be pretty dumb about them.
We don't want Faye to start the EM reactor in tests because it makes testing much harder.
We don't want any non-native JSON elements in the job hash, like symbols.
We don't want that to happen, so we disable transactional tests here.
We emulate Unix on the former but not the latter.
We expect one of EOFError or Errno::ECONNRESET in normal operation (when the client goes away).
We expect the bin stub to activate the version that actually contains the binstub.
We expect to find (basename).gem in the 'cache' directory.
We follow the same principle regardless of which Ruby version we're running under.
We found +path+ directly in an unresolved gem.
We get back an object that has all of the data from our feed, accessible through methods.
We go back to the connection for the column queries because Topic.columns is cached and won't report changes to the DB
We go from right to left because pairs are pushed onto rescue_handlers as rescue_from declarations are found.
We gotta get rid of it if it's there, before we do anything else.
We have a sorted Array of codepoints that we wish to partition into ranges such that the start- and endpoints form an inclusive set of codepoints with property _property_.
We have no direct reference to the colon source range following an optional keyword argument's name, so must construct one.
We have some records loaded from the database (persisted) and some that are in-memory (memory).
We have to load these up front because otherwise we'll try to load them while we're testing rubygems, and thus we can't actually load them.
We have to reprocess the source to pickup the changes.
We have to require the generated helper to show the problem because the test helpers just check for generated files and contents but do not actually load them.
We have to splat here because latest_specs is an array, while the others are hashes.
We ignore any extra parameters in the request_uri if the submitted url doesn't have any either.
We increment the last codepoint seen and compare it with the current codepoint.
We indicate the position after the left brace.
We invoke the rules indirectly via apply instead of by just calling them as methods because if the rules use left recursion, apply needs to manage that.
We know that this directory doesn't have a .document file, so we're looking for real files.
We know that we wrote a UTF-8 encoded string to the cache file, so it's safe to force-encode it back to UTF-8 if it happens to be ASCII-8BIT.
We lazy-load rubocop so that the task doesn't dramatically impact the load time of your Rakefile.
We may want to disable CSRF protection for APIs since they are typically designed to be state-less.
We merge in these scopes for two reasons:
We might be able to change the implementation to remove conflicts by index, rather than column name
We must avoid making file names too long for some filesystems to handle If they are short, we can leave them human-readable
We must have met our goals because FasterCSV was renamed to CSV and replaced the original library as of Ruby 1.9.
We must make sure that the reflection's active_record name matches up with the current reflection's klass name.
We must not change indentation of heredoc strings.
We need a Pathname because we've monkeypatched extname to support double extensions (e.g. tar.gz).
We need this initializer so all extra initializers added in engines are consistently executed after all the initializers above across all engines.
We need this special case to avoid creating the pattern /**/* which searches the entire file system.
We need to apply this decorator here, rather than on module inclusion.
We need to avoid the following situation:
We need to check declarations and comments
We need to create a new class in order to install the new named route.
We need to do that processing and can not use caching.
We need to recursively iterate over all `else` branches and consider all but the last `node` an `elsif` branch and consider the last `node` the actual `else` branch.
We need to recursively iterate over all `else` branches.
We need to require application after the server sets environment, otherwise the --environment option given to the server won't propagate.
We need to sign the message in order to avoid padding attacks.
We need to store the RAILS_DEV_PATH in a constant, otherwise the path can change in Ruby 1.8.7 when we FileUtils.cd.
We need to undef `root`, RenderTestCases don't want this to be defined
We need to verify the message in order to avoid padding attacks.
We often find ourselves with a medium-sized chunk of behavior that we'd like to extract, but only mix in to a single class.
We often want to render different html/json/xml templates for phones, tablets, and desktop browsers.
We only care about the CPU sub-type.
We only need the contents of the branch, not the condition.
We only support indirectly modifying through associations which have a belongs_to source.
We only want to deal with AR objects.
We only want to do this once per struct, so the struct is deleted after unpacking.
We override this in the sqlite3 and postgresql adapters to use only the column name (as per syntax requirements).
We override this, because XMLDecls and DocTypes must go at the start of the document
We prefer `https` for security and proxy reasons.
We prefer find_all over select.
We prefer system `ln` over `FileUtils.ln_sf` because the latter seems to have weird failure conditions (that were observed in the past).
We prune these out in Specification._load, but if we don't have the constant, Marshal blows up.
We redefine these private methods in order to add the /o modifier to the Regexp literals, which forces string interpolation to happen only once instead of each time the method is called.
We represent the various high-level code constructs that appear in Ruby programs: classes, modules, methods, and so on.
We rescue these so that we can skip bad versions and continue walking the history
We return the directive name and any parameters as a two element array if the name is in +allowed+.
We save the namespace prefix for the context node and convert it back when we write it.
We search for .rubocop.yml only if we haven't already found it for the given directory.
We see the RPAREN as the next token, so we need to exit early.
We select the dir as being case-sensitive if either the UPCASED or the downcased variant is missing.
We should decouple this from the AR::Base implementation.
We should get `old_backend` here even while another thread is using `new_backend`.
We should probably have a better mechanism for this than adding special cases to this method.
We should push this separation upstream
We silently rollback this transaction without telling the user.
We specifically do a manual INSERT here, and then test only the SELECT functionality.
We still need to keep checking all the permutations, but our probability of finding one will diminsh over time.
We still need to respect the source_reflection's :primary_key option, though.
We store our author information in a yaml file and specify the keys in The post front matter.
We then convert the namespace prefix for the node to the unique ID.
We then subclass the HTML output class to deal with these:
We track Thread objects, instead of just using counters, because we need exclusive locks to be reentrant, and we need to be able to upgrade share locks to exclusive.
We unset temporary bundler variables to load proper bundler and Gemfile.
We use Gem::Specification.reset the first time only so that if there are unresolved deps that leak into the whole test suite, they're at least reported once.
We use a fully-qualified name in some strings, and a relative constant name in some other to test correct handling of both cases.
We use an implicit NULL so schema.rb is compatible with other databases.
We use our object ID here to avoid conflicting with other instances
We want a nice table layout, so we allow space inside empty hashes.
We want crashes to show up the same in each run.
We want to be able to start and stop EM loop in tests to make things simpler.
We want to change the preferred delimiters for word arrays.
We want to end up with a Time object with one-day resolution.
We want to generate the methods via module_eval rather than define_method, because define_method is slower on dispatch.
We want to rely on what has come before obviously, but with delegation we can take just the methods we need and even rename them as appropriate.
We want to use the klass from this reflection, rather than just delegate straight to the source_reflection, because the source_reflection may be polymorphic.
We will attempt to require the stdlib version
We will call it WeakHash, since it's really just a Hash except all of it's keys and values can be garbage collected.
We won't change the name because of backward compatibility.
We won't check modifier or ternary conditionals.
We're going to 'transcode' bytes from UTF-8 when possible, then fall back to CP1252 when we get errors.
We're looking for (block (send (const nil :Proc) :new) ...)
We're looking for (block (send nil :lambda) ...)
We're nested inside a +yield_shares+ call: we'll resume as soon as there isn't an exclusive lock in our way
We're obliged to implement this (even though it doesn't actually get called here) to properly comply with the Rack SPEC
We're only checking predicate methods.
We've found that "end" is not aligned with the start node (which can be a block, a variable assignment, etc).
We've seen how to inspect local variables before:
We've specified the list of fruits on George's fixture, but we could've just as easily specified a list of monkeys on each fruit.
Weak ETags are considered to be semantically equivalent but not byte-for-byte identical.
Weak ETags are what we almost always need, so they're the default.
Weak Reference class that allows a referenced object to be garbage-collected.

While executing the given block, the recorded will be in reverting mode.
While it's blocked, it holds no lock, so it doesn't interfere with any other attempts.
While it's strongly recommended that you use key-based cache expiration (see links in CacheHelper for more information), it is also possible to manually expire caches.
While this class does neither the breaking into newlines nor indentation, it is used in a stack (as well as a queue) within PrettyPrint, to group objects.
While this provides the most flexibility, you can also unintentionally introduce dependencies on the underlying database.
White space (blanks, tabs, or newlines) in the format string matches any amount of white space, including none, in the input.
Whitelisted types are returned as-is.

With this option, each pixel in the source image will be expanded into a block of x x y pixels in the destination image, all the same color.
With this technique it is possible to do overloading by number of parameters, but only for Proc handler, because you cannot define two methods of the same name in the same class.
With this you will have to limit your self to String keys, otherwise you will get an ArgumentError because WeakRef cannot create a finalizer for a Symbol.
With this, you simply do:
Within the block we can substitute +sh.cd+ to +cd+, because the scope within the block uses +sh+ already.

You must call cipher.encrypt or cipher.decrypt before calling this method.
You must create them by yourself.
You must define your own inflection rules for languages other than English.
You must manually generate the join table with a migration such as this:
You must open a connection to an SMTP server before sending messages.
You must pass a +filename+ and may optionally add a +mode+ for Ruby's open().
You must provide a +mode+ with an embedded Encoding designator unless your data is in Encoding::default_external().
You must provide a block that accepts a git repository name for expansion.
You must provide this unless your data is in Encoding::default_external().
You must require 'time' to use this method.
You must supply the following configuration entries:
You must use Time.zone.today instead.
You must write message before the block is closed.
You need WSH(Windows Scripting Host) to run this script.
You need to be careful with assumptions regarding the target: The proxy does not fetch records from the database until it needs them, but new ones created with +build+ are added to the target.
You need to check the instructions for each of them.
You need to make sure yourself that your dom ids are valid, in case you overwrite this method.
You need to start a memcached server inorder to run these tests
You need to supply an absolute path or a path relative to the configured destination:
You need to update translation when your application is added or modified messages.
You never instantiate your mailer class.
You now know that the original value of +foo+ was nil, and that it still was nil after calling +get_foo+.
You pass a +path+ and any +options+ you wish to set for the read.
You pass your +str+ to read from, and an optional +options+ Hash containing anything CSV::new() understands.
You probably want to use one of the Enumerable methods instead.
You probably want to use the FileHandler servlet instead as it handles directories and fancy indexes.
You should avoid modifying the association content, before autosave callbacks are executed.
You should be careful to avoid deadlocks.
You should be in the sample/rdoc/markup/ directory when you do this, as it hardwires the path to the files it needs to require.
You should be sure to measure your actual performance across targeted browsers both before and after this change.
You should consult the documentation for your database to understand the semantics of these different levels:
You should disable those middlewares whenever streaming in development or production.
You should not use the +match+ method in your router without specifying an HTTP method.
You should put the implementation of your command in rubygems/commands.
You should read stdout and stderr simultaneously (using threads or IO.select).
You should register your command against the Gem::CommandManager instance, like this:
You should set Content-Type: header field for POST.
You should specify a license for your gem so that people know how they are permitted to use it, and any restrictions you're placing on it.
You should use +have_func+ rather than +try_func+.
You should use +have_var+ rather than +try_var+.
You should use ::register and ::cancel instead of creating the timeout handler directly.
You should use DOMDocument.
You should use File.unlink to remove it.
You shouldn't ever need to create a TimeWithZone instance directly via +new+.
You simply pass the irregular in singular and plural form.
You simply supply the +up+ logic, and the Migration system figures out how to execute the down commands for you.
You still could pass +:include+ and +:exclude+ to set the list of attributes you want to wrap.
You still need to set up model validations.
You translate messages in .po by a PO file editor.
You typically won't use this module directly, you can see it implemented in OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket.
You usually don't use this directly and is intended for those needing to write new performance curve fits (eg: you need a specific polynomial fit).
You usually press +c+ when you are finished debugging your program and want to resume its execution.
You will have to rewrite those to the explicit form:
You will have to specify this when +sep+ is a multibyte character, for example.
You will need ordered fixtures when you have foreign key constraints on keys in the same table.
You will need to either:
You will need to require 'scanf' to use these methods Scans the current string.
You will obtain whatever was defined in +some_new_scope+.
You would use +content_for+ in your template to specify the title:
You'll need to use a special comment format to call those out:
You'll notice that this next section is very similar to the same section in match(), but just a liiittle different.
You'll read permanent cookies through the regular accessor.
You'll see that appear accepts a data parameter, which it then uses as part of its model call.
You're encouraged to add a unique index in the database to deal with this even more unlikely scenario.
You're testing whether a transaction works correctly.
You're then responsible for dealing with the conflict by rescuing the exception and either rolling back, merging, or otherwise apply the business logic needed to resolve the conflict.
You've now added your public certificate as a trusted source.
Your CoffeeScript can then connect to the server without needing to specify the URL directly:
Your data is never transcoded (unless you ask Ruby to transcode it for you) and will literally be parsed in the Encoding it is in.
Your database does not support transactions.
Your first attempt is:
Your own parser is completely yours.
Your primary database in the development environment is "my_application" but the Book model connects to a separate database called "library_db" (this can even be a database on a different machine).
Your server can also configure this for you by setting the X-Sendfile-Type header.
ZERO-WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE aka BOM Returns a regular expression pattern that matches the passed Unicode codepoints.
Zero parts are removed as not significant.
Zero precision with significant is a mistake (would always return zero), so we treat it as if significant was false (increases backwards compatibility for number_to_human_size)
Zlib::GzipWriter doesn't have some IO methods do nothing:  ensure will set default
_Examples_ CData.new( source ) CData.new( "Here is some CDATA" ) CData.new( "Some unprocessed data", respect_whitespace_TF, parent_element )
_Note_: Other methods provide a simpler interface to this one, and are suitable for nearly all benchmarking requirements.

scanf can be called either with or without a block.
scanf for Ruby is based on something of an amalgam of C scanf implementations and documentation, rather than on a single canonical description.
scanf for Ruby is based on the C function scanf(3), but with modifications, dictated mainly by the underlying differences between the languages.
scanf for Ruby returns an array of successful conversions, whereas scanf(3) returns the number of conversions successfully completed.
scanf is an implementation of the C function scanf(3), modified as necessary for Ruby compatibility.
scanf was developed as the major activity of the Austin Ruby Codefest (Austin, Texas, August 2002).

this branch is reached by two tests:
this build number applies to 3.2.6, 4.0 and 4.1 https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/Xcode.md
this can fail on adapters which require ORDER BY expressions to be included in the SELECT expression if the reorder clauses are not correctly handled
this cause "called on terminated object".
this controller exists in the admin namespace as well which is the only difference from previous test
this cop does not handle spaces after a ternary operator, which are instead handled by Style/SpaceAroundOperators.
this could fail due to gem dep collisions, go lax
this could probably be formatted more gracefully
this ensures that all producer threads call push before close
this fails if SSL_MODE_ACCEPT_MOVING_WRITE_BUFFER is missing:
this feature implies backport command which wraps tool/merger.rb
this feature requires custom redmine which allows add_related_issue API

this lets us do YAML defaults and not have an extra fixture entry
this may be required.
this method is quite imperfect and can be fooled to do much better, we would need to do global analysis of the whole codebase
this method must only be called while holding connection pool's mutex
this modifies the passed request_env directly
this must be done AFTER adding mod to its parent, so that the full name is correct:
this next line will fail if the attribute methods module is generated lazily after the association methods module is generated
this one is important
this should be overridden by concrete adapters
this should be required from -I
this should be written out to the config file.
this should be yaml_as but to avoid syck
this should speed up a lot
this should wake up the waiting threads one by one in order
this test assumes 32bit/64bit platform

this test is too fragile.
this test only fails on ruby missing File.realpath
this tests that this job class doesn't get its adapter set.
this thing was done because of a bug',
this triggers action_methods
this will consume very long time or fail by ENOSPC on a filesystem which sparse file is not supported
