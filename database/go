That would permit Int.Text to be implemented w/o the need for string copy if the number is negative.
The -e flag changes the handling of erroneous packages, those that cannot be found or are malformed.
The bytes are taken from at most one Read on the underlying Reader, hence n may be less than len(p).
The code being tested is not OS-specific, so it does not need to be tested on all operating systems.
The conditions are more general, though, and we may find that we need to do it always in the future.
The deferred func recovers from the error and returns, making memcopy return the current value of n.
The effect is that deferreturn is called again and again until there are no more deferred functions.
The fact that it works at all today is probably due to the fact that ODOT and OINDEX are irrelevant.
The first four bits is the CINFO (compression info), which is 7 for the default deflate window size.
The format is heavily biased toward C, but for simplicity the String methods use a pseudo-Go syntax.

This is the first type we've sent on this Encoder, so it has type id 65 (0 through 64 are reserved).
This is the subset of the transitive closure of the package's dependencies that need initialization.
This package does not require that behavior but html/template's escaping does, so it's a good habit.

There is one exception: runtime/cgo's job is to bridge the cgo and non-cgo worlds, so it necessarily has files in both.
These goroutines yield during local work, so that switching from a blocked goroutine to other goroutines is profitable.

R_ADDRMIPS (only used on mips64) resolves to the low 16 bits of an external address, by encoding it into the instruction.
Sign signs an arbitrary length hash (which should be the result of hashing a larger message) using the private key, priv.
Special case because it's a method: the ignored item might define types and we need to record their state in the decoder.
Special case: always show runtime.gopanic frame, so that we can see where a panic started in the middle of a stack trace.
Special case: x is a bidirectional channel value, T is a channel type, and x's type V and T have identical element types.

The argument obj must be a pointer to an object allocated by calling new or by taking the address of a composite literal.
The builtins are already defined in the C prolog, and we don't want to duplicate function definitions we've already done.
The calls serve two purposes: 1) they are opaque to escape analysis, so the argument is considered to escape to the heap.
The ciphertext should be signed before authenticity is assumed and, even then, consider that messages might be reordered.
The compiler options are passed through uninterpreted when invoking the C compiler to compile the C parts of the package.
The order chosen is arbitrary, only consistency and division into equivalence classes (Types that compare CMPeq) matters.

We check for test success by scanning for the final PASS returned by the test harness, assuming the worst in its absence.
We convert to uint32 to avoid the extra test for negative, and in the index we convert to uint8 to avoid the range check.
We document that "" means "GET" for Request.Method, and people have relied on that from NewRequest, so keep that working.
We drop all others because they can appear in places that cause our counters to appear in syntactically incorrect places.
We have made modifications to the package p being tested and are rebuilding p (as ptest), writing it to the testDir tree.
We must explicitly assert properties of the Signature's receiver since it doesn't participate in Identical() or String().
We therefore use a for loop to fill the first row, and then use the first row as the slice source for the remaining rows.
We use "other" rather than "previous" here because the first declaration seen may not be textually earlier in the source.
We'll use a PrintableString if the character set in the string is sufficiently limited, otherwise we'll use a UTF8String.
When the parameter is type T defined as *X, simulate a little of the laxness of C by making the argument *X instead of T.

Data represents the DWARF debugging information loaded from an executable file (for example, an ELF or Mach-O executable).
Do not need to call fd.writeLock here, because fd is not yet accessible to user, so no concurrent operations are possible.
Don't always call NewWriter, as that forces a bytes.Buffer and other small bufio Writers to have a minimum 4k buffer size.
During mark termination, these caches can still be used temporarily, but must be disposed to the global lists immediately.
Even when enabled, the server may not change its identity between handshakes (i.e. the leaf certificate must be the same).
Exception: on OS X, programs such as Shark only work with dynamic binaries, so leave it enabled on OS X (Mach-O) binaries.
Extra line breaks between statements in the source are respected but at most one empty line is printed between statements.
For now, we assume that empty interface is OK but non-empty interfaces, with Stringer and Error handled above, are errors.
Force another conversion, so that the previous conversion doesn't get optimized away into constructing the returned array.
HTML templates treat data values as plain text which should be encoded so they can be safely embedded in an HTML document.

If the type of the first field of a structure is RawContent then the raw ASN1 contents of the struct will be stored in it.
If the unexported flag (-u) is true, isExported returns true because it means that we treat the name as if it is exported.
If we exit this loop normally then we need to call emitLiteral next, though we don't yet know how big the literal will be.
Import returns an error if it finds a comment it cannot understand or finds conflicting comments in multiple source files.
In godefs mode, if this field is a C11 anonymous union then treat the first field in the union as the field in the struct.
In the former case, the type checker can do a top-level lookup, and in the latter case it will do a separate field lookup.
IsARMMULA reports whether the op (as defined by an arm.A* constant) is MULA, MULAWT or MULAWB, the 4-operand instructions.

Our fallback hash functions don't, so we only enable the difficult tests when we know the AES implementation is available.
Passing the address of a slice with a Go pointer, where we are passing the address of an element that is not a Go pointer.
Perhaps that rule is specific to the case of CRC32, since no 66 0F 38 F1 instruction is defined (today) (that we know of).
Recognize 'go tool pack grc' because that was the formerly canonical way to build a new archive from a set of input files.
ResolveReference always returns a new URL instance, even if the returned URL is identical to either the base or reference.
Since there is no I/O (everything is in memory), the global lock mu protects the whole file system state, and that's okay.

This automatically prevents an infinite resend loop because we'll run out of the cached keep-alive connections eventually.
This code uses printer.Fprint, not conf.Fprint, because we don't want //line comments in the middle of the function types.
This is slightly conservative, in that we don't check that the goto is reachable, so L: goto L will not provoke a warning.
Update operand types to the default type rather then the target (interface) type: values must have concrete dynamic types.

A close from the opposing client is treated as a graceful close, even if there was some unparse-able data before the close.
Actually we reserve 544 GB (because the bitmap ends up being 32 GB) but it hardly matters: e0 00 is not valid UTF-8 either.
Allocate a new span of npage pages from the heap for GC'd memory and record its size class in the HeapMap and HeapMapCache.
An image.YCbCr is always fully opaque, and so if the mask is nil (i.e. fully opaque) then the op is effectively always Src.

Finally it pops but does not execute the deferred function, calls runtime.entersyscall, and returns to runtime.cgocallback.
For a channel receive src might be on the stack of some other goroutine, so we can't unwind the stack even if we wanted to.
For instance, if the mode is ScanIdents (not ScanStrings), the string "foo" is scanned as the token sequence '"' Ident '"'.
For instance, time.Sunday is of type time.Weekday, so it is defined in the type but not in the Consts list for the package.

It is can be (R1), (R2*scale), or (R1)(R2*scale) where R1 may be a simple register or register pair R:R or (R, R) or (R+R).
It was wrong because the next thing in the input might be a type definition, which would lead to an incorrect length check.
Its decimal representation does not repeat, but there are only 10 possible digits, so it should be reasonably compressible.
ListenAndServe listens on the TCP network address srv.Addr and then calls Serve to handle requests on incoming connections.
Mod truncates the maximum value to one less than the argument, but signed mod can be negative, so only unsigned mod counts.
Most headers are small anyway (so we generally won't have CONTINUATION frames), and extra frames only waste 9 bytes anyway.
NOTE: we need to regrab the key as it has potentially been updated to an equal() but not identical key (e.g. +0.0 vs -0.0).
Now instead we do the work whenever we're under or at the utilization work and pay for it by letting the mutator run later.
On success, consumeValue returns the value consumed (and de-quoted/escaped, if a quoted-string) and the rest of the string.
Once it all unblocks and returns, so that it cannot be referring to fd.sysfd anymore, the final decref will close fd.sysfd.

There is a lot of moving parts in an iOS test harness (notably lldb) that can swallow useful stdio or cause its own ruckus.
There shouldn't be much difference between reading 4kB and 32kB: the hard part is getting to the data, not transferring it.
These lines set CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS and pkg-config directives that affect the way cgo's C code is built.
These presentation routines already have to add the zone offset, so adding the translation to the alternate epoch is cheap.

When and if we implement a moving garbage collector, cgoCheckPointer will pin the pointer for the duration of the cgo call.
When cgo is involved, the compile step already requires gcc, so it is not problematic for the link step to require gcc too.

Set if we see an object compiled by the host compiler that is not from a package that is known to support internal linking mode.
Shortcircuit finds situations where branch directions are always correlated and rewrites the CFG to take advantage of that fact.
So adjust it upward a little bit ourselves: 1/4 MB to get away from the running binary image and then round up to a MB boundary.
Some docs say: "It is expected to be a comma separated list of personal data where the first item is the full name of the user."
SplitList splits a list of paths joined by the OS-specific ListSeparator, usually found in PATH or GOPATH environment variables.
Test that the mutually recursive types in recursive1.go made it intact and with the same meaning, by assigning to or using them.
TestNilcheckKeepRemove verifies that duplicate checks of the same pointer are removed, but checks of different pointers are not.
That's unnecessary with HTTP/2's framing, so the server is able to calculate the length while still sending trailers afterwards.
The cap built-in function returns the capacity of v, according to its type: Array: the number of elements in v (same as len(v)).
The check for "orig_" here handles orig_eax in the x86 ptrace register sets, which otherwise have all fields with reg_ prefixes.
The file system need never be written to disk, so it is represented as in-memory Go data structures, never in a serialized form.
The gccgo compiler did not reliably report mismatches between the number of function results and the number of expected results.
The group numbers are stored in the inverse slice (inv), and when all groups are sorted, this slice is the inverse suffix array.
The output testing.BenchmarkHello    10000000    282 ns/op means that the loop ran 10000000 times at a speed of 282 ns per loop.
The presentation computations - year, month, minute, and so on - all rely heavily on division and modulus by positive constants.
The restore may be off in an unlikely branch somewhere and it would be better to have the spill in that unlikely branch as well.
The second argument, quote, specifies the type of literal being parsed and therefore which escaped quote character is permitted.
The span's sweep extinguishes all the references to gcBitsArenas.previous by pointing gcAllocBits into the gcBitsArenas.current.
There are 2 parts: 1) The value sent by the sender sg is put into the channel and the sender is woken up to go on its merry way.
These errors relate to new connection, not to AcceptEx, so ignore broken connection and try AcceptEx again for more connections.
This also puts the old fd into blocking mode, meaning that I/O will block the thread instead of letting us use the epoll server.
This can cause one or more spurious rebuilds, but only for 1 second, until the object finally has an mtime later than the input.
This can happen when using all.bash with GOROOT_FINAL set, because the tests are run before the final installation of the files.
This file implements sysSocket and accept for platforms that do not provide a fast path for setting SetNonblock and CloseOnExec.
This file is named "generic" because at a certain point Linux started standardizing on system call numbers across architectures.
This first satisfies blocked assists on the work.assistQueue and then flushes any remaining credit to gcController.bgScanCredit.
This is a backup alarm in case the test wedges with a goroutine spinning and its background timer does not get a chance to fire.
This is actually not the x86 NOP anymore, but at the point where it gets used, AX is dead so it's okay if we lose the high bits.
This padding ensures that taking the address of the zero-sized thing can't manufacture a pointer to the next object in the heap.
This section is non-overlapping in that the copy length for this section is always less than or equal to the backwards distance.
This simple check dramatically reduces the nuisance rate for the shadowing check, at least until something cleverer comes along.
This test is racy: it assumes that after a write to a localhost TCP connection, the peer TCP connection can immediately read it.
This was generated using an old version of OpenSSL and is missing a leading zero byte in the private key that should be present.
This was previously broken by https://codereview.appspot.com/95760043/ and reverted in https://codereview.appspot.com/117600043/
Unlike in tests, benchmark logs are always printed, so as not to hide output whose existence may be affecting benchmark results.
We must register the concrete type for the encoder and decoder (which would normally be on a separate machine from the encoder).
We need to unblock it before raising the signal, or the signal we raise will be ignored until we return from the signal handler.
We use it to hold the index of the node in the variables array, plus 1 (so that 0 means the Node is not in the variables array).
Within the subtree rooted at foo, an import of "crash/bang" resolves to "foo/vendor/crash/bang", not the top-level "crash/bang".
binary objects to add to package archive Likely of the form foo_windows.syso, but the name was vetted above with goodOSArchFile.

usedOldKey is true if the ticket from which this session came from was encrypted with an older key and thus should be refreshed.
1) If there is a binary operator with a right side unary operand that would clash without a space, the cutoff must be (in order):
337:345 keep a reference to the prefix to allow to overwrite it later if we detect that we can use ustar longnames instead of pax
A 2nd method on the same level may be in the method set and may not collide with the first one, thus leading to a false positive.
A Rgn represents a single regopt variable over a region of code where a register could potentially be dedicated to that variable.
A benchmark ends when its Benchmark function returns or calls any of the methods FailNow, Fatal, Fatalf, SkipNow, Skip, or Skipf.

Before Go 1.2, an InvalidUTF8Error was returned by Marshal when attempting to encode a string value with invalid UTF-8 sequences.
Both inputs and the result are assumed to be in big-endian representation (to match the semantics of Int.Bytes and Int.SetBytes).
But changing runtime/internal/sys/zversion.go should have an effect: that's how we tell when we flip from one release to another.
But we're going to be much more lenient for now and just search for any byte that's not a valid byte in any of those expressions.
Calldepth is used to recover the PC and is provided for generality, although at the moment on all pre-defined paths it will be 2.
Cannot modify the LineStack directly, or else lookups for the earlier line numbers will get the wrong answers, so make a new one.
Disclaimer of Warranty  These software programs are available to the user without any license fee or royalty on an "as is" basis.
Don't bother with GOOS, GOHOSTOS, GOARCH, and GOHOSTARCH, because setup will take care of those when bootstrapBuildTools returns.

Event ports are level-triggered, unlike epoll and kqueue which can be configured in both level-triggered and edge-triggered mode.
Expressions that are constant at run time but not considered const by the language spec are not turned into constants until walk.
For arguments and results, the bitmap covers all variables, so we must include all the variables, even the ones without pointers.
For asynchronous channels, the receiver gets its data from the channel buffer and the sender's data is put in the channel buffer.
For each entry and exit number, the values one larger and smaller are reserved to indicate "strictly above" and "strictly below".
For example, amd64 and amd64p32 are both members of the AMD64 family, and ppc64 and ppc64le are both members of the PPC64 family.
For unsigned types, the result will be negative and thus "too large": We must limit the result precision to the type's precision.
Given a byte slice and an offset into the array, it will try to parse a suitable ASN.1 value out and store it in the given Value.
If a section is compressed, FileSize is the size of the compressed data, while Size (above) is the size of the uncompressed data.
If the Go version of this C type uses unsafe.Pointer, we can't use a type assertion, because the Go file might not import unsafe.
If the function returns SkipDir when invoked on a non-directory file, Walk skips the remaining files in the containing directory.
If the import has a doc comment, that comment is taken as literal C code to be used as a preamble to any C code generated by cgo.
If the offset cannot fit in a 12-bit unsigned displacement then we need to create a copy of the stack pointer that we can adjust.
If the reader also implements UnreadRune, that method will be used to save the character and successive calls will not lose data.
If the utimensat syscall isn't available (utimensat was added to Linux in 2.6.22, Released, 8 July 2007) then fall back to utimes
If there is a new panic during the deferred call, that panic will find d in the list and will mark d._panic (this panic) aborted.
If there is no registered handler that applies to the request, Handler returns a ``page not found'' handler and an empty pattern.
If typ is not an (unnamed) pointer or an interface, use *typ instead, because the method set of *typ includes the methods of typ.
If we see a call to sigpanic, we do not back up the PC to find the line number of the call instruction, because there is no call.
In checkmark mode, in the heap bitmap, the high bit of the 2-bit entry for the second word of the object holds the checkmark bit.
It assumes that rawurl was received in an HTTP request, so the rawurl is interpreted only as an absolute URI or an absolute path.
It calls f for each such component, passing the component (aka element) type and memory offset, assuming t starts at startOffset.
It returns the name of the authentication protocol and optionally data to include in the initial AUTH message sent to the server.

Normally Chan's underlying value must be a channel, and Send's underlying value must be assignable to the channel's element type.
Note stats for non-innermost loops are slightly flawed because they don't account for inner loop exits that span multiple levels.
Note that we can (and do) add arbitrary attributes to a DIE, but only the ones actually listed in the Abbrev will be written out.
Note using r.FormValue("readbody") because for POST requests that would read from r.Body, which we only conditionally want to do.
On a system with registers (anything but 386) we can evaluate x first and then know we have enough registers for i, j, k as well.
On systems where Sqrt is a single instruction, the compiler may turn a direct call into a direct use of that instruction instead.
One big chunk followed by a little chunk, but the small bufio.Reader size should prevent the second chunk header from being read.
Optimization: if there is already a pending preemption request (from the previous loop iteration), don't bother with the atomics.
Putting the + 1 inside the numerator as a + 7 keeps the numerator from being negative, which would cause it to round incorrectly.

The input may be a gzip-compressed encoded protobuf or one of many legacy profile formats which may be unsupported in the future.
The map contains two kinds of entries: 1) Lower-case keys are standard import paths and list the allowed imports in that package.
The most important rule is that if the local installation is running version "go1", get searches for a branch or tag named "go1".
The package is specified by a list of *ast.Files and corresponding file set, and the package path the package is identified with.
The read should fault, except that sometimes we hit addresses that have had C or kernel pages mapped there readable by user code.
The spill may be used in the future, either by an outright use in the code, or by shuffling code inserted after stack allocation.
The stack is not owned *except* that a channel operation may read or write parts of the stack under the appropriate channel lock.
The system creates an access token when a user logs on, and every process executed on behalf of the user has a copy of the token.
The traceback and context functions may be called from a signal handler, and must therefore use only async-signal safe functions.
There is a long history of changes to isStale to try to make -a into a suitable workaround for bugs in the mtime-based decisions.

This example creates a PriorityQueue with some items, adds and manipulates an item, and then removes the items in priority order.
This function is called automatically before a benchmark starts, but it can also used to resume timing after a call to StopTimer.
This is necessary because the liveness analysis for the garbage collector works at variable granularity, not at word granularity.

-p path Set expected package import path for the code being compiled, and diagnose imports that would cause a circular dependency.
A line break immediately followed by a "correcting" unindent is swapped with the unindent - this permits proper label positioning.
After this phase returns, the order of b.Values matters and is the order in which those values will appear in the assembly output.
After this phase returns, the order of f.Blocks matters and is the order in which those blocks will appear in the assembly output.
Another problem is that due to file system imprecision, an input and output that are actually ordered in time have the same mtime.

Every splitting function ensures that there are at least StackLimit bytes available below SP when the splitting prologue finishes.
For an interface type, the returned Method's Type field gives the method signature, without a receiver, and the Func field is nil.
For instance, the second (05 in the reference time) in our value is 39, so it doesn't need padding, but the minutes (04, 06) does.
However, that specification has flaws and new designs should use version two, usually called by just OAEP and PSS, where possible.
However, the entire Go runtime is initialized from just one function, so it is unlikely that this will need to grow in the future.
If Go 1.4 has built mypkg into mypkg.a, a build using Go 1.5 must rebuild mypkg.a, but from mtimes alone mypkg.a looks up-to-date.
If ServeHTTP panics, the server (the caller of ServeHTTP) assumes that the effect of the panic was isolated to the active request.

The use of runtime.GOOS and runtime.GOARCH makes sure that a cross-compiled compiler expects to compile for its own target system.
There are no more bytes of data in this segment, but we may still be able to read the next symbol out of the previously read bits.
There is no loss of expressivity here, because the final uint16, if it is used, is supposed to be a NUL, and Go doesn't need that.
These magic auxint values let us easily cache non-numeric constants using the same constants map while making collisions unlikely.
This form allows a copy from the 1-bit to the 4-bit form to keep the pointer bits contiguous, instead of having to space them out.
This map's max size is bounded by 2*len(statusText), two protocol types for each known official status code in the statusText map.

We do it in this order, rather than only adding -rdynamic later, so that -extldflags can override -rdynamic without using -static.
We don't use the quotient parity anymore (round half up instead of round to even) but it's still here in case we change our minds.
We populate these ahead of time so we're not reading from req.Header after their Handler starts and maybe mutates it (Issue 14940)

A Scope maintains the set of named language entities declared in the scope and a link to the immediately surrounding (outer) scope.
Assuming that SetFinalizer is not called again, the next time the garbage collector sees that obj is unreachable, it will free obj.
Because c.L is not locked when Wait first resumes, the caller typically cannot assume that the condition is true when Wait returns.
Because this directive can subvert the type system and package modularity, it is only enabled in files that have imported "unsafe".
Before exporting or importing, the type tables are populated with the predeclared types (int, string, error, unsafe.Pointer, etc.).
Both the receiver and transmitter will do all necessary indirection and dereferencing to convert between gobs and actual Go values.
CL 21202 introduced a compiler crash in the handling of a varargs function in the same recursive group as a function that calls it.
Cannot use go/build directly because cmd/dist for a new release builds against an old release's go/build, which may be out of sync.
Checking two ranges helps when appending case-folded alphabets, so that one range can be expanding A-Z and the other expanding a-z.
Compatibility note: crosscall2 actually takes four arguments, but it works to call it with three arguments when calling _cgo_panic.
Complexity of Stable Sorting Complexity of block swapping rotation Each Swap puts one new element into its correct, final position.
Delicate dance: thread transitions from spinning to non-spinning state, potentially concurrently with submission of new goroutines.
Exitsyscall could check trace.enabled long before and then suddenly wake up and decide to write to trace at a random point in time.
FindStringIndex returns a two-element slice of integers defining the location of the leftmost match in s of the regular expression.
Fix's rewrites are idempotent, so that it is safe to apply fix to updated or partially updated code even without using the -r flag.
For a 96-bit nonce, the nonce, along with a four-byte big-endian counter starting at one, is used directly as the starting counter.
For operations involving a remote network connection, like Dial, Read, or Write, Source is the corresponding local network address.
FormatMessage is deprecated (msgsrc should be uintptr, not uint32, but can not be changed due to the Go 1 compatibility guarantee).
From gofrontend/go/export.h Note that these values are negative in the gofrontend and have been made positive in the gccgoimporter.
If Content-Type isn't set, use the file's extension to find it, but if the Content-Type is unset explicitly, do not sniff the type.
If WriteAt is writing to a destination with a seek offset, WriteAt should not affect nor be affected by the underlying seek offset.
If c.Stdin is not an *os.File, Wait also waits for the I/O loop copying from c.Stdin into the process's standard input to complete.
If the extension is supported, Extension also returns a string that contains any parameters the server specifies for the extension.
If the parse fails, take the type out of the cache so that the next call with this offset doesn't hit the cache and return success.
If the path is not in its canonical form, the handler will be an internally-generated handler that redirects to the canonical path.
If the response is one of the following redirect codes, Get follows the redirect after calling the Client's CheckRedirect function:
If the user has a deadline in the future, but the delay calculation overflows, then set the deadline to the maximum possible value.
If there are too many outputs to fit in the tag, that is handled at the encoding end as EscHeap, so there is no need to check here.
If they already provided a CipherSuite list, return an error if it has a bad order or is missing ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256.
In Linux the user address space for each architecture is limited as follows (taken from the processor.h file for the architecture):
In slices and arrays, as well as maps, all elements, even zero-valued elements, are transmitted, even if all the elements are zero.
In the case that the key agreement protocol doesn't use a ServerKeyExchange message, generateServerKeyExchange can return nil, nil.
Instead, we split the log into two halves and let the signal handler fill one half while a goroutine is writing out the other half.
Introduction This package wraps package text/template so you can share its template API to parse and execute HTML templates safely.
Issue 10047: gccgo failed to compile a type switch where the switch variable and the base type of a case share the same identifier.
It also applies to the job control signals SIGTSTP, SIGTTIN, and SIGTTOU, in which case the system default behavior does not occur.
It may be customized to recognize only a subset of those literals and to recognize different identifier and white space characters.
It must be a relative path: it must not start with a drive letter (e.g. C:) or leading slash, and only forward slashes are allowed.
It simplifies the computations to choose the cycle boundaries so that the exceptional years are always delayed as long as possible.
IterFields returns the first field or method in struct or interface type t and an Iter value to continue iterating across the rest.
MOVW foo(SB), R is actually MOV addr, REGTEMP MOVW REGTEMP, R where addr is the address of the DWORD containing the address of foo.
Most clients should use the runtime/trace package or the testing package's -test.trace flag instead of calling StartTrace directly.
Nested template definitions When parsing a template, another template may be defined and associated with the template being parsed.
NewChunkedReader returns a new chunkedReader that translates the data read from r out of HTTP "chunked" format before returning it.
On systems that support direct access to the TLS memory, this pair of instructions can be reduced to a direct TLS memory reference:
Otherwise, the new field is shallower, and thus takes precedence, so drop the conflicting fields from tinfo and append the new one.
Parse source file and extract the AST without comments for this function, with position information referring to the file set fset.
RFC suggests that EOF without an alertCloseNotify is an error, but popular web sites seem to do this, so we can't make it an error.
So that is what we do, but only on systems likely to support it, which is to say, systems that normally use gold or the GNU linker.
TLS "var" in local exec mode: will become a constant offset from thread local base that is ultimately chosen by the program linker.
TODO: add method *Decoder.Reset(maxSize, emitFunc) to let callers re-use Decoders and their underlying buffers for garbage reasons.

TestHandshakeServerEmptyCertificates tests that GetCertificates is called in the case that Certificates is empty, even without SNI.
TestIncompleteSelection ensures that an incomplete selector expression is parsed as a (blank) *ast.SelectorExpr, not a ast.BadExpr.
TestSCMCredentials tests the sending and receiving of credentials (PID, UID, GID) in an ancillary message between two UNIX sockets.
The PLT stubs generated by the system linker on ppc64le when "std r2, 24(r1)" to save the TOC pointer in their callers stack frame.
The algorithm is breadth-first search over the set of structs to include - the top struct and then any reachable anonymous structs.
The argumentation in the paper carries through for Swap operations, especially as the block swapping rotate uses only O(M+N) Swaps.
The bits have the same definition on all systems, so that information about files can be moved from one system to another portably.
The compiler rewrites calls to this function into instructions that fetch the g directly (from TLS or from the dedicated register).
The encoding of objects is straight-forward: Constants, variables, and functions start with their name, type, and possibly a value.
The largest match offset The maximum number of tokens we put into a single flate block, just to stop things from getting too large.
The linker can prune methods that are not directly called or assigned to interfaces, but only if reflect.Type.Method is never used.
The object file can then be combined with other objects into a package archive or passed directly to the linker (``go tool link'').
The real fix is probably to define new values for LSym.Type corresponding to mapped and unmapped notes and handle them in dodata().
There's room for arbitrary complexity here, but we keep it simple and handle just a few important cases: int, string, and Stringer.
This all assumes the only tls variable we access is g, which we can't check here, but will when we assemble the second instruction.
This check is very early in newstack so that even the status change from Grunning to Gwaiting and back doesn't happen in this case.
This is almost like the Benchmark function, except that we override the benchtime and catch the failure result of the subbenchmark.
This lazy approach works out in practice: we don't mind if the first couple gc rounds don't have quite the maximum number of procs.
To distinguish them from non-directive comments, the directives require no space between the slashes and the name of the directive.
Transport is an implementation of RoundTripper that supports HTTP, HTTPS, and HTTP proxies (for either HTTP or HTTPS with CONNECT).
Turn relative (PC) into absolute (PC) automatically, so that most branch instructions don't need comments giving the absolute form.
Use context Values only for request-scoped data that transits processes and APIs, not for passing optional parameters to functions.
Used in NewTicker, dropping sends on the floor is the desired behavior when the reader gets behind, because the sends are periodic.
We always pass absolute paths of source files so that the error messages will include the full path to a file in need of attention.
We could change the functions to return -1, 0, 1 and reduce the number of calls for greater efficiency: an exercise for the reader.
We did that after each fix, so this appears redundant, but it is necessary to generate gofmt-compatible source code in a few cases.
We don't care because base-2 exponents can only show up in machine-generated textual export data which will use correct formatting.
When the go command makes the wrong build decision and does not rebuild something it should, users fall back to adding the -a flag.
Which is expected to be one of 11-13, 21-23, 31, 32, and y.val() should be equal to which and y.p.val() should be equal to z.val().
allocObjects examines the profile records for the named function and returns the allocation stats aggregated by source line number.

cbcDecAble is an interface implemented by ciphers that have a specific optimized implementation of CBC decryption, like crypto/aes.
cbcEncAble is an interface implemented by ciphers that have a specific optimized implementation of CBC encryption, like crypto/aes.
cgoCheckUsingType is like cgoCheckTypedBlock, but is a last ditch fall back to look for pointers in src using the type information.

for go:linkname go:cgo_import_static x_cgo_setenv go:linkname x_cgo_setenv x_cgo_setenv go:linkname _cgo_setenv runtime._cgo_setenv
grepBothNot looks for a regular expression in the test run's standard output or stand error and fails, logging msg, if it is found.
invalidate is called by Framer.ReadFrame to make this frame's buffers as being invalid, since the subsequent frame will reuse them.
mygetgrgid_r is a wrapper around getgrgid_r to to avoid using gid_t because C.gid_t(gid) for unknown reasons doesn't work on linux.
mygetpwuid_r is a wrapper around getpwuid_r to to avoid using uid_t because C.uid_t(uid) for unknown reasons doesn't work on linux.
no need to use nat.scan for exponent digits since we only care about int64 values - the from-scratch scan is easy enough and faster
nslookup stderr output contains also debug information such as "Non-authoritative answer" and it doesn't return the correct errcode
numBytes returns the number of bytes left to read in the current file's entry in the tar archive, or 0 if there is no current file.

scanBasePrefix reports whether the integer begins with a 0 or 0x, and returns the base, digit string, and whether a zero was found.
spec: "A package-scope or file-scope identifier with name init may only be declared to be a function with this (func()) signature."
spec: "Two identifiers are different if they are spelled differently, or if they appear in different packages and are not exported.
the padding makes sure that the MCentrals are spaced CacheLineSize bytes apart, so that each MCentral.lock gets its own cache line.
this is spaced funny so that the compiler will print a different line number for each len call if it decides there are type errors.
+build darwin dragonfly freebsd linux nacl netbsd openbsd plan9 solaris Unix cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator.
AppendQuote appends a double-quoted Go string literal representing s, as generated by Quote, to dst and returns the extended buffer.
Arithmetic expressions are typically written as a sequence of individual method calls, with each call corresponding to an operation.
As of Go 1.2, Marshal instead coerces the string to valid UTF-8 by replacing invalid bytes with the Unicode replacement rune U+FFFD.
As with all element types, if the struct is used in an array its size must first be aligned to a multiple of the struct's alignment.
Because net must be used by any package that wants to do networking portably, it must have a small dependency set: just L0+basic os.
Because the world is stopped, all Ps will observe that write barriers are enabled by the time we start the world and begin scanning.
Building method for interface table and receiver is smaller than the single pointer-sized word that the interface call will pass in.

ErrRequestAborted is returned by Read when a handler attempts to read the body of a request that has been aborted by the web server.
ErrUnsupportedAlgorithm results from attempting to perform an operation that involves algorithms that are not currently implemented.
Exported objects may be from different packages because they may be re-exported as depencies when exporting inlined function bodies.
FailNow must be called from the goroutine running the test or benchmark function, not from other goroutines created during the test.
For instance, if x is a slice,  Sizeof returns the size of the slice descriptor, not the size of the memory referenced by the slice.
For many of these, you can see the default value of on your system by running 'go env NAME', where NAME is the name of the variable.
Gob depends on being able to take the address of zeroed Values it creates, so use this wrapper instead of the standard reflect.Zero.
Hashing algorithm inspired by xxhash: https://code.google.com/p/xxhash/ cityhash: https://code.google.com/p/cityhash/ +build 386 arm
However, there can be multiple leftmost-longest matches, with different submatch choices, and here this package diverges from POSIX.
However, we cannot be sure that all of them have been closed, so the program might still encounter ETXTBSY even with such an RWLock.
However, we will be able to delete them once we enable the new export format by default, so it's not worth the effort (issue 13241).
If it encounters an error before the end of the directory, Readdirnames returns the names read until that point and a non-nil error.
If n does not refer to computed addresses (that is, if n only refers to variables whose addresses have not been taken), no aliasing.
If not, then there is a bug somewhere and the garbage collection or stack growth may not have seen the correct picture of the stack.
If path is relative the result will be relative to the current directory, unless one of the components is an absolute symbolic link.
If the handler is done but never sent a Content-Length response header and this is our first (and last) write, set it, even to zero.
If the leftmost 8 * emLen - emBits bits of the leftmost octet in maskedDB are not all equal to zero, output "inconsistent" and stop.
If the name part of the tag is completely empty, get default from XMLName of underlying struct if feasible, or field name otherwise.
If the response is one of the following redirect codes, Head follows the redirect after calling the Client's CheckRedirect function:
If the result visitor w is not nil, Walk visits each of the children of node with the visitor w, followed by a call of w.Visit(nil).
If the slice can be SSA'd, it'll be on the stack, so there will be no write barriers, so there's no need to attempt to prevent them.
If we are running a release copy of Go and didn't find a content-based reason to rebuild the standard packages, do not rebuild them.
In a legal backslash escape, no matter how long, only the character immediately after the escape can itself be a backslash or quote.
In order to avoid needing heavy lifting here, we adopt the following strategy: there is a stack of available m's that can be stolen.
IsMIPS64CMP reports whether the op (as defined by an mips.A* constant) is one of the CMP instructions that require special handling.
IsPPC64CMP reports whether the op (as defined by an ppc64.A* constant) is one of the CMP instructions that require special handling.

It defines a local interface with an unexported method f, which will appear with a package-qualified method name in the export data.
ListenAndServe listens on the TCP network address addr and then calls Serve with handler to handle requests on incoming connections.
Look for the attribute that indicates the object uses the hard-float ABI (a file-level attribute with tag Tag_VFP_arch and value 1).
Make sure we spill with the size of the slot, not the size of x (which might be wider due to our dropping of narrowing conversions).
Mark termination re-scans only as far as the first frame that hasn't hit a stack barrier and then removes and un-hit stack barriers.
Maybe we want to allow this at some point, but for now we disallow it to prevent errors like using NewValue1A instead of NewValue1I.
NetlinkRIB returns routing information base, as known as RIB, which consists of network facility information, states and parameters.
Note that it is explicitly okay to have write barriers in this function because completion of concurrent mark is best-effort anyway.
Note that these are truncated on 32-bit systems, so the bottom 32 bits of the larger addresses must themselves be invalid addresses.
OS X 10.9.2 mishandles the malformed address case, making it look like a user-generated signal (like someone ran kill -SEGV ourpid).
One needs to manually confirm that the handshake in the golden data file for ResumeDisabled does not include a resumption handshake.
PollDesc objects must be type-stable, because we can get ready notification from epoll/kqueue after the descriptor is closed/reused.
R_METHODOFF resolves to a 32-bit offset from the beginning of the section holding the data being relocated to the referenced symbol.
Refined nodes (e.g., ODOTPTR as a refinement of OXDOT) are exported as their unrefined nodes (since this is what the importer uses).
Reproducibility is required in the presence of iterators, as our evacuation decision must match whatever decision the iterator made.
Return next state according to the game rules: exactly 3 neighbors: on, exactly 2 neighbors: maintain current state, otherwise: off.
Slices of bytes in the returned token data refer to the parser's internal buffer and remain valid only until the next call to Token.
TODO(mkrautz): use the lChainIndex and lElementIndex fields of the CertChainPolicyStatus to provide proper context, instead using c.
TODO(rsc): REG_R0 and REG_F0 used to be (when register numbers started at 0) exregoffset and exfregoffset, which are unset entirely.
Text in an encoded-word in a display-name must not contain certain characters like quotes or parentheses (see RFC 2047 section 5.3).
That variable may itself correspond to a hardware register, to represent the use of registers in the unoptimized instruction stream.
The AST is generally of the form of a linear search using if..goto, although binary search is used with long runs of concrete types.
The AST preserves source-level parentheses so there is no need to introduce them here to correct for different operator precedences.
The Handler argument should be used to handle HTTP requests and will initialize the Request's TLS and RemoteAddr if not already set.
The already allocated f.intbuf with a capacity of 68 bytes is large enough for integer formatting when no precision or width is set.
The handshake message unmarshallers expect to be able to keep references to data, so pass in a fresh copy that won't be overwritten.
The linker can prune methods that are not directly called or assigned to interfaces, but only if reflect.Value.Method is never used.
The only way we can end up with such small sel.ncase values here is for a larger select in which most channels have been nilled out.
The return value scanEnd indicates that a single top-level JSON value has been completed, *before* the byte that just got passed in.
The returned error is nil if the command runs, has no problems copying stdin, stdout, and stderr, and exits with a zero exit status.
There is another apparently viable approach, recorded here in case the "PC within setsSP function" check turns out not to be usable.
This behavior can be managed using Transport's CloseIdleConnections method and the MaxIdleConnsPerHost and DisableKeepAlives fields.
This encoding algorithm, which prioritizes speed over output size, is based on Snappy's LZ77-style encoder: github.com/golang/snappy
This is a one- or two-element equivalence class containing rune and ToLower(rune) and ToUpper(rune) if they are different from rune.
This is accomplished through the writeByte method for a single symbol, or combinations of writeSlice/writeMark for multiple symbols.
This is correct in that FSTSW is a pseudo-op for the pair, but it really is a pair of instructions: execution can stop between them.
This is done by taking the address of the relocation and adding 4 to it (since the rip-relative offset can at most be 32 bits long).
This test checks that Go is doing the correct explicit checks to catch these nil pointer accesses, not just relying on the hardware.
This transition enables write barriers because stack barriers assume that writes to higher frames will be tracked by write barriers.
To avoid filling the dynamic table with lots of unnecessary symbols, mark all Go symbols local (not global) in the final executable.
To use gobs, create an Encoder and present it with a series of data items as values or addresses that can be dereferenced to values.
Transport uses HTTP/1.1 for HTTP URLs and either HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 for HTTPS URLs, depending on whether the server supports HTTP/2.
We compile the data into the binary so that the benchmark is a stand-alone binary that can be copied easily from machine to machine.
When linking relocatable objects, various flags need to be filtered out as they are inapplicable and can cause some linkers to fail.
When passing a pointer to a field in a struct, the Go memory in question is the memory occupied by the field, not the entire struct.
When we pop the last pointer, we shift the stack up by one work buffer by bringing in a new full buffer and discarding an empty one.
addDep notes that x now depends on dep, and x's finalClose won't be called until all of x's dependencies are removed with removeDep.
can read one character (rune) past the input they return, which means that a loop calling a scan routine may skip some of the input.
expectHandshakeErrorIncluding, when not empty, contains a string that must be a substring of the error resulting from the handshake.
go:nosplit The //go:nosplit directive specifies that the next function declared in the file must not include a stack overflow check.
grepBoth looks for a regular expression in the test run's standard output or stand error and fails, logging msg, if it is not found.
insert code to contain ambiguously live variables so that garbage collector only sees initialized values when it looks for pointers.
launch with `go run arithConstGen.go` a file called arithConst_ssa.go will be written into the parent directory containing the tests
lookup returns information about the time zone in use at an instant in time expressed as seconds since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC.
madvise will round this to any physical page covered* by this range, so an unaligned madvise will release more memory than intended.
packageCache is a lookup cache for loadPackage, so that if we look up a package multiple times we return the same pointer each time.

(If we ran that code here we could invoke orderstmt on the if-else chain instead.) For now just clean all the temporaries at the end.
- The name of a field of the data, which must be a struct, preceded by a period, such as .Field The result is the value of the field.
1) The log.Print from the http server (generated by the caught panic) will go to the pipe instead of stderr, making the output quiet.
6g used to compile these as two different hash codes so it missed the duplication and worse, compiled the wrong code for one of them.
A Client is higher-level than a RoundTripper (such as Transport) and additionally handles HTTP details such as cookies and redirects.
A Profile is a collection of stack traces showing the call sequences that led to instances of a particular event, such as allocation.
A note must start at the beginning of a comment with "MARKER(uid):" and is followed by the note body (e.g., "// BUG(gri): fix this").
According to RFC 6874, an HTTP client, proxy, or other intermediary must remove any IPv6 zone identifier attached to an outgoing URI.
Allocate a word of thread local storage and store the offset from the thread local base to the thread local storage in this variable.
Allocation is done using size segregated per P allocation areas to minimize fragmentation while eliminating locks in the common case.
Any control flow, such as branches or fall-throughs, that target the existing instruction are adjusted to target the new instruction.
At this point the position information of identifiers in f2 should match the position information of corresponding identifiers in f1.
By default, Import searches vendor directories that apply in the given source directory before searching the GOROOT and GOPATH roots.
C code may store Go pointers in C memory, subject to the rule above: it must stop storing the Go pointer when the C function returns.
CONNECT requests are used two different ways, and neither uses a full URL: The standard use is to tunnel HTTPS through an HTTP proxy.
Calls with a negative delta, or calls with a positive delta that start when the counter is greater than zero, may happen at any time.
Clear references to pi so that the only way the garbage collection will find the pointer is in the argument frame, typed as a *Outer.
ClientSessionCache is a cache of ClientSessionState objects that can be used by a client to resume a TLS session with a given server.
Crash now instead of silently executing the garbage collection or stack copy incorrectly and setting up for a mysterious crash later.
Dial connects to the given network address using net.Dial and then initiates a TLS handshake, returning the resulting TLS connection.
Don't bother saving PC if it's zero, which is probably a call to a nil func: the old link register is more useful in the stack trace.
ErrFrameTooLarge is returned from Framer.ReadFrame when the peer sends a frame that is larger than declared with SetMaxReadFrameSize.
ErrHijacked is returned by ResponseWriter.Write calls when the underlying connection has been hijacked using the Hijacker interfaced.
Following this function, h is guaranteed to be initialized into a complete tree (i.e., neither over-subscribed nor under-subscribed).
For example, three passes could transmit coefficient 0 (the DC component), coefficients 1-5, and coefficients 6-63, in zig-zag order.
For simplicity in setup, the connection is defined to understand these types a priori, as well as the basic gob types int, uint, etc.
HandleHTTP registers an HTTP handler for RPC messages to DefaultServer on DefaultRPCPath and a debugging handler on DefaultDebugPath.
If ReadAt is reading from an input source with a seek offset, ReadAt should not affect nor be affected by the underlying seek offset.
If a non-nil importer and universe scope are provided, they are used to resolve identifiers not declared in any of the package files.
If a pointer argument must be converted to uintptr for use as an argument, that conversion must appear in the call expression itself:
If it has two and the returned error is non-nil, execution terminates and an error is returned to the caller as the value of Execute.
If not zero, then a padding error during decryption will cause a random plaintext of this length to be returned rather than an error.
If the base type has not been encountered yet, a new type with the given name but no associated declaration is added to the type map.
If the binary is missing, we mark the package stale so that if a rebuild is needed, that rebuild attempt will produce a useful error.
If the request includes an If-Modified-Since header, ServeContent uses modtime to decide whether the content needs to be sent at all.
If we later choose the set of candidate variables from a larger list, these cases could be deprioritized instead of removed entirely.
In general Seek may not be efficient, but it is optimized for common cases such as seeking to the end to find the length of the data.
In the recursive case, we have to update this at most len(list) times and can stop when we an iteration that doesn't change anything.
In the rules, the tag of a field refers to the value associated with the key 'xml' in the struct field's tag (see the example above).
It is a struct instead of an interface because the implementation needs no state, and I expect to add some data fields at some point.
It returns a float64 because that's what reflection needs, but its return value is known to be accurately representable in a float32.
It should be covered via the ReadSlice test since ReadLine simply calls ReadSlice, and it's that function that handles the last byte.
It's not safe to use FILE_SKIP_COMPLETION_PORT_ON_SUCCESS if non IFS providers are installed: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2568167
MOVQ g_panic(CX), BX TESTQ BX, BX JEQ end LEAQ (autoffset+8)(SP), DI CMPQ panic_argp(BX), DI JNE end MOVQ SP, panic_argp(BX) end: NOP
NewGCMWithNonceSize returns the given 128-bit, block cipher wrapped in Galois Counter Mode, which accepts nonces of the given length.
No semicolon is present for the labeled statements and because the last token is a colon ":", no semicolon is inserted automatically.
Normalize normalizes f so that the highest bit of the mantissa is set, and returns the number by which the mantissa was left-shifted.
On arm, stack frame is two words and there's a saved LR between SP and the stack frame and between the stack frame and the arguments.
Otherwise, it will perform at least n units of work, but may perform more because scanning is always done in whole object increments.
PSSSaltLengthAuto causes the salt in a PSS signature to be as large as possible when signing, and to be auto-detected when verifying.
Read implements the standard Read interface: it reads data from the pipe, blocking until a writer arrives or the write end is closed.
Remote import paths Certain import paths also describe how to obtain the source code for the package using a revision control system.
Restricting us to ASCII is sufficient to handle the IP protocol names and allow us to not depend on the strings and unicode packages.
SSA uses this, but so does the front end to see if should not inline a function because it is a candidate for intrinsic substitution.
Some system resolvers will return a valid port number when given a number over 65536 (see https://github.com/golang/go/issues/11715).
Some systems, such as Ubuntu, always add --build-id to every link, but we don't want a build ID when we are producing an object file.
Tests that chunked server responses that write 1 byte at a time are buffered before chunk headers are added, not after chunk headers.
The Huffman tree can switch every 50 symbols so there's a list of tree indexes telling us which tree to use for each 50 symbol block.
The buffers are being put on the full queue so that the write barriers will not simply reacquire them before the GC can inspect them.
The compression level can be DefaultCompression, NoCompression, or any integer value between BestSpeed and BestCompression inclusive.
The following example shows how to use Value for periodic program config updates and propagation of the changes to worker goroutines.
The function should store a zero to indicate the top of the stack, or that the caller is on a different stack, presumably a Go stack.
The need for this was made obvious by changing the (deterministic) scheduling order in Go 1.5 and breaking many poorly-written tests.
The readOp constants describe the last action performed on the buffer, so that UnreadRune and UnreadByte can check for invalid usage.
The timeout is specified in microseconds - ensure that we do not end up dividing to zero, which would put us to sleep indefinitely...
The two known misprints in the book are repaired here in the source listings for the gamma function and the incomplete beta integral.
Then it invokes the host linker (usually gcc) to combine the go.o object file and any supporting non-Go code into a final executable.
There are multiple implementations: all that matters is that we can find out how many traces there are and obtain each trace in turn.
There is never a time that Gobuf.g's contain the only references to a goroutine: the publishing of the goroutine in allg comes first.
These tests serve as an example but also make sure we don't change the output of the random number generator when given a fixed seed.
This is generated by the code that copies small values out of closures, and that code has DX live, so avoid DX and just use AX twice.
This is less a test of SetPanicOnFault and more a check that the operating system and the runtime can process these faults correctly.
This is most commonly used by low-level runtime sources invoked at times when it is unsafe for the calling goroutine to be preempted.
This option is supported only in descendants of 4.4BSD, to make an effective multicast application that requires quick draw possible.
Those can arrange for main.main to run in the main thread by calling runtime.LockOSThread during initialization to preserve the lock.
Thus, a repeated symbol ends up being encoded with many zeros, as the symbol will be at the front of the list after the first access.
To the caller G, the invocation of F then behaves like a call to panic, terminating G's execution and running any deferred functions.
Two relocation entries: MACHO_ARM64_RELOC_PAGEOFF12 MACHO_ARM64_RELOC_PAGE21 if r.Xadd is non-zero, add two MACHO_ARM64_RELOC_ADDEND.

VARDEF is an annotation for the liveness analysis, marking a place where a complete initialization (definition) of a variable begins.
We allow known flags both before and after the package name list, to allow both go test fmt -custom-flag-for-fmt-test go test -x math
We can only guarantee that the loops runs within limits of induction variable if the increment is 1 or when the limits are constants.
We can pass a slice or array, meaning that we should check the entire slice or array but need not check any other part of the object.
When dynamically linking, we want references to functions defined in this module to always be to the function object, not to the PLT.
Write the request concurrently with waiting for a response, in case the server decides to reply before reading our full request body.

pstring copies the string s to b, prepending it with a 16-bit length in little-endian order, and returning the remaining slice of b..
readAll reads from r until an error or EOF and returns the data it read from the internal buffer allocated with a specified capacity.
recv parameter list present (may be empty) spec: "The receiver is specified via an extra parameter section preceding the method name.
rsaKeyAgreement implements the standard TLS key agreement where the client encrypts the pre-master secret to the server's public key.
scan scans the number corresponding to the longest possible prefix from r representing an unsigned number in a given conversion base.
this is spaced funny so that the compiler will print a different line number for each len call when it decides there are type errors.
to close later Try to cause a race: Both the Transport and the proxy handler's Server will try to read/close req.Body (aka req2.Body)
(1) Before the build IDs were introduced, building with alternate tags would happily reuse installed objects built without those tags.
A server may register multiple objects (services) of different types but it is an error to register multiple objects of the same type.
All these sends, receives and selects interact chaotically at runtime, but we are careful that this whole construct does not deadlock.
An implicitly tagged time value, that happens to have an implicit tag equal to a GENERALIZEDTIME, should still be parsed as a UTCTime.
Apple's codesign_allocate (a helper utility for the codesign utility) can do this fine itself if it is run on a dynamic Mach-O binary.
Because the pos often points to the start of an expression instead of the inner part with the actual error, the precision can mislead.
Browsers do handle such stuff (actually differently) but RFC 6265 seems to be clear here (e.g. section 4.1.2.3) in requiring a reject.
Cgo incorrectly computed the alignment of structs with no Go accessible fields as 0, and then panicked on modulo-by-zero computations.
CharsetReader, if non-nil, defines a function to generate charset-conversion readers, converting from the provided charset into UTF-8.
Close invalidates and potentially stops any current prepared statements and transactions, marking this connection as no longer in use.
Compatibility: Any future changes to the package will endeavor to maintain compatibility with streams encoded using previous versions.
Cover is also used by 'go test -cover' to rewrite the source code with annotations to track which parts of each function are executed.
Currently build mode shared forces external linking mode, and external linking mode forces an import of runtime/cgo (and math on arm).
DetectContentType always returns a valid MIME type: if it cannot determine a more specific one, it returns "application/octet-stream".
Do executes and returns the results of the given function, making sure that only one execution is in-flight for a given key at a time.
Do not change another G's status while holding this lock (in particular, do not ready a G), as this can deadlock with stack shrinking.

GobEncoder is the interface describing data that provides its own representation for encoding values for transmission to a GobDecoder.
However, this means that SliceHeader and StringHeader are only valid when interpreting the content of an actual slice or string value.
IF LR exists, sigpanictramp must save it to the stack before entry to sigpanic so that panics in leaf functions are correctly handled.
If a connRequest was fulfilled or the *driverConn was placed in the freeConn list, then true is returned, otherwise false is returned.
If f calls Run, the result will be an estimate of running all its subbenchmarks that don't call Run in sequence in a single benchmark.
If the source start point is higher than the destination start point, then we compose the rows in bottom-up order instead of top-down.
If x and y are zero, it assumes that they represent the point at infinity because (0, 0) is not on the any of the curves handled here.
In Go1.5 the empty string encodes to "0", while this is not a valid number literal we keep compatibility so check validity after this.
In all following words, we set the scan/dead appropriately to indicate that the object contains to the next 2-bit entry in the bitmap.
In the worst case, we get two elements from the first byte (which is encoded differently) and then every varint is a single byte long.
Incoming notes are compared against this table using strncmp, so the order matters: longer patterns must appear before their prefixes.
It can be parsed with the regular URL parser, and the path will end up in req.URL.Path, where it needs to be in order for RPC to work.
It carries a map remembering what types are in progress so we don't recur when faced with recursive types or mutually recursive types.
It is intended behavior that Reader.Reset can be called on a zero-value Reader and be the equivalent as if NewReader was used instead.
It may change for reasons of efficiency, or we may even switch to a standard file format if there are compelling benefits to doing so.
It should be in the first few bytes, but read a lot just in case, especially given our past problems on OS X with the build ID moving.
MustHaveGoRun checks that the current system can run programs with ``go run.'' If not, MustHaveGoRun calls t.Skip with an explanation.
Notice also that this takes place after stack allocation, so the stack allocator does not need to process these malformed flow graphs.
Otherwise, the name is taken to be a location name corresponding to a file in the IANA Time Zone database, such as "America/New_York".
Otherwise, the output (for a scalar) is the field number, as an encoded integer, followed by the field data in its appropriate format.
PkgPath returns a named type's package path, that is, the import path that uniquely identifies the package, such as "encoding/base64".
ProcessRemoteIO will execute submit IO requests on behalf of other goroutines, all on a single os thread, so it can cancel them later.
Set needextram when we've just emptied the list, so that the eventual call into cgocallbackg will allocate a new m for the extra list.
Single quotes are reserved in URLs, but are only used in the obsolete "mark" rule in an appendix in RFC 3986 so can be safely encoded.

The "capacity" is only known statically for strings, arrays, and pointers to arrays, and it is the same as the length for those types.
The AESNI GCM code decrypts and authenticates concurrently and so overwrites the output buffer before checking the authentication tag.
The Lookup APIs use various sources such as local database, DNS or mDNS, and may use platform-dependent DNS stub resolver if possible.
The biggest drawback to this solution is that it requires that we can tell whether it's safe to read from the memory pointed at by PC.
The compiler emits calls to printlock and printunlock around the multiple calls that implement a single Go print or println statement.
The goroutine leaves the non-zero value in place until it has finished processing the log half and then flips the number back to zero.
The method set has unexported methods, so all the implementations are provided by the same package, so the method set can be extended.
The runtime reserves space for this book-keeping structure at the top of the stack allocation itself (just above the outermost frame).
The sched.pc will never be returned to, but setting it to goexit makes clear to the traceback routines where the goroutine stack ends.
The top 5 bits of the mantissa are used to load limits from a table of constants and the rest are used to scale linearly between them.
These goroutines will not run until the mark phase, but they must be started while the work is not stopped and from a regular G stack.
These routines end in 'ln', do not take a format string, always add spaces between operands, and add a newline after the last operand.
They have more structure that we could test, but if this sanity check passes, we'll assume the cut and paste from the FIPS PDF worked.
This is done by generating a uniformly distributed random number and applying the cumulative distribution function for an exponential.
This is not needed for a correct expression x as the parser will be ok with a nil topScope, but be cautious in case of an erroneous x.
This isn't really an exhaustive test of eqstring, it's just a convenient way of documenting (via eqstring_generic) what eqstring does.
Verifies that the Transport doesn't reuse a connection in the case where the server replies before the request has been fully written.
We got caught in the middle of a stack barrier (presumably by a signal), so stkbar may be inconsistent with the barriers on the stack.
We use the formulation described in chapter 2, section 2.4, "The Yacas Book of Algorithms": http://yacas.sourceforge.net/Algo.book.pdf

As a disassembler, we don't really know whether we're seeing a meaningless prefix or one whose meaning we simply haven't been told yet.
BImportData imports a package from the serialized package data and returns the number of bytes consumed and a reference to the package.
Because this is for purposes of escape accounting, not execution, some semantically dubious node combinations are (currently) possible.
Both cases are invalid because a zero length tree cannot encode anything and a length-1 tree can only encode EOF and so is superfluous.
Check if we are in a chroot by checking if the inode of / is different from 2 (there is no better test available to non-root on linux).

Do sends an HTTP request and returns an HTTP response, following policy (such as redirects, cookies, auth) as configured on the client.
Due to inlining, the source line information is in general a list of positions representing a call stack, with the leaf function first.
Each match result is either a single -, meaning no match, or a space-separated sequence of pairs giving the match and submatch indices.
Each update batch results in a (pc, line) pair, where line applies to every PC from pc up to but not including the pc of the next pair.
Fast versions cannot handle big values - the cutoff size for fast versions in ../../cmd/internal/gc/walk.go must be at most this value.
Figure out if it's better to rewrite the tree and make the heapaddr construct explicit or to keep this detail hidden behind the scenes.
Filenames frequently share path prefixes, so this can save a lot of space and make export data size less dependent on file path length.
For incoming server requests, the context is canceled when either the client's connection closes, or when the ServeHTTP method returns.
For operators, delimiters, and keywords the string is the actual token character sequence (e.g., for the token ADD, the string is "+").
GetLoweredClosurePtr should only appear in the entry block where there are no phi functions, so there is no conflict or ambiguity here.

Hijack detaches the ServerConn and returns the underlying connection as well as the read-side bufio which may have some left over data.
If ReadSlice encounters an error before finding a delimiter, it returns all the data in the buffer and the error itself (often io.EOF).
If the command name does not specify a path, the shell searches the current directory for an executable file matching the command name.
If the command name includes a file extension, the shell searches each directory for the exact file name specified by the command name.
If the inputs are new than the outputs on the first machine but copied first, they end up older than the outputs on the second machine.
If the last comment in the function starts with "Output:" then the output is compared exactly against the comment (see examples below).

It does not affect code generation but is used by the system linker when relaxing "initial exec" model code to "local exec" model code.
It is common to use a func literal as the argument, in order to share inputs and outputs with the code around the call to system stack:
It uses a feedback control algorithm to adjust the memstats.next_gc trigger based on the heap growth and GC CPU utilization each cycle.
Keep the links in dedicated operating system threads, so that this program tests coordination between pthreads and not just goroutines.
Most system calls would return ENFILE (too many open files), so at the least EMFILE should be easy to recognize if this comes up again.
NOTE: Note that the corresponding chunk-writing procedure in Conn.Write has a bug since it does not check for success of io.WriteString
NewCommentMap creates a new comment map by associating comment groups of the comments list with the nodes of the AST specified by node.
Otherwise, during the execution of the command a separate goroutine reads from Stdin and delivers that data to the command over a pipe.

Test304Responses verifies that 304s don't declare that they're chunking in their response headers and aren't allowed to produce output.
TestDeferPtrsGoexit is like TestDeferPtrs but exercises the possibility that the stack grows as part of starting the deferred function.
Tests that we don't leak Transport persistConn.readLoop goroutines when a server hangs up immediately after saying it would keep-alive.
The Client's Transport typically has internal state (cached TCP connections), so Clients should be reused instead of created as needed.
The Examples section of the documentation includes an illustration of how to use MakeFunc to build a swap function for different types.
The annotations are intended as guidelines only since a single Go grammar rule may be covered by multiple parse methods and vice versa.
The currently used stack includes everything down to the SP plus the stack guard space that ensures there's room for nosplit functions.
The lookup function expects UTC, so we pass t in the hope that it will not be too close to a zone transition, and then adjust if it is.
The memory profiler can call copy from a slice on the system stack, which msan used to think meant a reference to uninitialized memory.
The parser flags the outer variable as possibly shared, and therefore sets addrtaken, even though it ends up not being actually shared.
The period needs escaping only in the last segment of the path, and it makes for happier users if we escape that as little as possible.
The value deltas are signed and transmitted in zig-zag form, where a complement bit is placed in bit 0, and the pc deltas are unsigned.

This communication is only required in assembly functions that make calls to other functions that might be preempted or grow the stack.
This computes which symbol resolver stub we came through and invokes the dynamic resolver via a pointer provided by the dynamic linker.
This is hack to work around "artificial" end positions in the AST which are computed by adding 1 to (presumably valid) token positions.
This should happen fairly quickly, since all the I/O is non-blocking, and any attempts to block in the pollDesc will return errClosing.
Use local copies of original parameters, so that a stack trace due to one of the throws below shows the original block base and extent.

(Ideally, we'd see if the AST parent is a SelectorExpr, but that requires PathEnclosingInterval from golang.org/x/tools/go/ast/astutil.)
After this call, port_getn will return one and only one event for that particular descriptor, so this function needs to be called again.
An InvalidIndexError is returned when an encoder references a table entry before the static table or after the end of the dynamic table.
An similar test crashed once during development, but it was only testing this tangentially and temporarily until another TODO was fixed.
AppendFloat appends the string form of the floating-point number f, as generated by FormatFloat, to dst and returns the extended buffer.
Because of (re-)exported inlined functions the importpkg may not be the package to which this function (and thus its parameter) belongs.
But then we'd get conflicts when we include the system headers for things like ucontext_t, so that happens in a separate file, defs1.go.
Complicating matters, taking the address of a slice or array element permits the C program to access all elements of the slice or array.

Group 1 - lock and repeat prefixes According to Intel, there should only be one from this set, but according to AMD both can be present.
However, the mutator is guaranteed to execute a write barrier when it publishes the pointer, so it will take care of marking the object.
If a file contains both definitions and declarations, then the two output files will produce duplicate symbols and the linker will fail.
If a test deferred an important cleanup function (like removing temporary files), there was no guarantee it would run on a test failure.
If host is omitted, as in ":8080", Listen listens on all available interfaces instead of just the interface with the given host address.

In order to minimize this cost, the Go runtime places stack barriers in exponentially-spaced frames, starting 1K past the current frame.
In that case, if the second (error) argument evaluates to non-nil during execution, execution terminates and Execute returns that error.
In the example, x.Block dominates y.Block, y.Block dominates z.Block, and z.Block dominates x.Block (treating "dominates" as reflexive).
In this usage hdr.Data is really an alternate way to refer to the underlying pointer in the slice header, not a uintptr variable itself.
Issues 8017 and 8058: walk modifies nodes generated by slicelit and causes an internal error afterwards when gen_as_init parses it back.
It also indirectly tests NewRequest and that it doesn't wrap an existing Closer inside a NopCloser, and that it serializes it correctly.
It is therefore not necessary when compiling client C of package P to read the files of P's dependencies, only the compiled output of P.
It prints a summary of the test results in the format: ok   archive/tar   0.011s FAIL archive/zip   0.022s ok   compress/gzip 0.033s ...
It would have been even better to start it before the collection, but doing so requires allocating memory, so it's tricky to coordinate.
Mach-O file writing http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/DOCUMENTATION/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/MachORuntime/Reference/reference.html
Most clients should use the runtime/pprof package or the testing package's -test.cpuprofile flag instead of calling CPUProfile directly.
Most clients should use the runtime/pprof package or the testing package's -test.memprofile flag instead of calling MemProfile directly.
Must treat yyy as leaking because *yyy leaks, and the escape analysis summaries in exported metadata do not distinguish these two cases.
NOTE: This is pretty naive implementation that contains many allocations and non-effective linear search, and should not be used freely.
On an operating system with aggressive buffering, cleaning incrementally like this keeps the intermediate objects from hitting the disk.
On arm64, stack frame is four words and there's a saved LR between SP and the stack frame and between the stack frame and the arguments.
On systems with PIE (position independent executables) enabled by default, -no-pie must be passed when doing a partial link with -Wl,-r.
Output: T0 (second version) invokes T1: (T1 invokes T2: (T2, version B)) T0 (first version) invokes T1: (T1 invokes T2: (T2, version A))
Passing pointers Go is a garbage collected language, and the garbage collector needs to know the location of every pointer to Go memory.
Perhaps in the future we will want to flush the headers out early if the first byte of the request body is taking a long time to arrive.
Return an error if the package has CXX files but it's not using cgo nor SWIG, since the CXX files can only be processed by cgo and SWIG.

The GC does not trace the pointers during collection, and the compiler does not emit write barriers for assignments of gclinkptr values.
The encoding pads the output to a multiple of 4 bytes, so Encode is not appropriate for use on individual blocks of a large data stream.
The encoding pads the output to a multiple of 8 bytes, so Encode is not appropriate for use on individual blocks of a large data stream.
The file data that follows is padded to an even number of bytes: if size is odd, an extra padding byte is inserted betw the next header.
The full stack test cases for IPConn have been moved to the following: golang.org/x/net/ipv4 golang.org/x/net/ipv6 golang.org/x/net/icmp
The function may return early (before the entire result is written) and return a formatting error, for instance due to an incorrect AST.
The gcBlackenEnabled check in malloc races with the store that clears it but an atomic check in every malloc would be a performance hit.
The initial load of p loads all the non-test imports and rewrites the vendored paths, so nothing should ever call p.vendored(p.Imports).
The log file, re2-exhaustive.txt, is generated by running 'make log' in the open source RE2 distribution https://github.com/google/re2/.
The return value is either nil to retry the request, the provided err unmodified, or the unwrapped error inside a beforeRespHeaderError.
The returned statement operates within the transaction and can no longer be used once the transaction has been committed or rolled back.
The returned values are the index, the number of bytes to consume up to the closing paren, if present, and whether the number parsed ok.
There are many possible trees that assign the same code length to each symbol (consider reflecting a tree down the middle, for example).
There may be multiple outstanding Calls associated with a single Client, and a Client may be used by multiple goroutines simultaneously.
This 00 is called the ``dead'' encoding: it signals that the rest of the words in the object are uninteresting to the garbage collector.
This allows new operating systems, such as android, to arrive without breaking existing code with innocuous source code in "android.go".
This file checks invariants of token.Token ordering that we rely on since package go/token doesn't provide any guarantees at the moment.
This heuristic will not work if the binaries are back-dated, as some binary distributions may do, but it does handle a very common case.
This method consults the following fields of the request: Host URL Method (defaults to "GET") Header ContentLength TransferEncoding Body
This mode will lead to massively larger export data (by a factor of 2 to 3) and should only be enabled during development and debugging.
This section documents those steps and the overall effect changes to signal handler settings by the non-Go code can have on Go programs.
This would lead to excessive thread parking/ unparking as the additional threads will instantly park without discovering any work to do.
Typical apps have the zoneinfo.zip in the root of their app bundle, read by the time package as the working directory at initialization.
Using a nil Qualifier is equivalent to using (*Package).Path: the object is qualified by the import path, e.g., "encoding/json.Marshal".
Using name as the attribute name is not required, but doing so will enable Unmarshal to match the attribute to the correct struct field.
Vet examines Go source code and reports suspicious constructs, such as Printf calls whose arguments do not align with the format string.
We can't use the flag package because some of the flags from our command line are for us, and some are for 6.out, and some are for both.
We have seen this type before, at a more shallow depth (note that multiples of this type at the current depth were consolidated before).
We think that the subtract should be sufficient in general, so do that unconditionally, but double-check, in case our beliefs are wrong.
While doing that, cmd/link will discover that there is no definition for _cgo_gcc_Cfunc_sin, referred to by the gc-compiled source file.
a keyAgreement implements the client and server side of a TLS key agreement protocol by generating and processing key exchange messages.
byteStringReplacer is the implementation that's used when all the "old" values are single ASCII bytes but the "new" values vary in size.
dalgsym is only called for a type that needs an algorithm table, which implies that the type is comparable (or else it would use ANOEQ).
determine par begin and end line (may be different if there are multiple parameter names for this par or the type is on a separate line)
errMap collects the regular expressions of ERROR comments found in files and returns them as a map of error positions to error messages.
errorf returns an error token and terminates the scan by passing back a nil pointer that will be the next state, terminating l.nextItem.
if this not the first argument for the block, then we need to remove the corresponding elements from the block predecessors and phi args
make the result channel buffered because we don't want to depend on channel queueing semantics that might possibly change in the future.
mulDenom sets z to the denominator product x*y (by taking into account that 0 values for x or y must be interpreted as 1) and returns z.
prf30 implements the SSL 3.0 pseudo-random function, as defined in www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/nss/ssl/draft302.txt section 6.
processCertsFromClient takes a chain of client certificates either from a Certificates message or from a sessionState and verifies them.
re-start the variable generation number we want to use small numbers for the return variables, so let them have the chunk starting at 1.
record anonymous fields (they may contribute methods) (some fields may have been recorded already when filtering exports, but that's ok)
refererForURL returns a referer without any authentication info or an empty string if lastReq scheme is https and newReq scheme is http.
return followed by a slash returns the regexp literal or the slash starts a regexp literal in an expression statement that is dead code.

+build darwin dragonfly freebsd netbsd openbsd BSD system call wrappers shared by *BSD based systems including OS X (Darwin) and FreeBSD.
A non-nil Response with a non-nil error only occurs when CheckRedirect fails, and even then the returned Response.Body is already closed.
A peekReader wraps an io.Reader, allowing one to peek ahead to see what's coming without stealing the data from the client of the Reader.
Addr is typically used to obtain a pointer to a struct field or slice element in order to call a method that requires a pointer receiver.
Also, since pkg.build.ImportPath is sometimes the unhelpful "" or ".", it looks for a directory name in GOROOT or GOPATH if that happens.
Another place where we intentionally omit memory barriers is when accessing mheap_.arena_used to check if a pointer points into the heap.
Because the instruction tables distinguished these two, any operand size prefix has been marked as used (to decide which branch to take).
Because we didn't understand that the real problem was the bug -a was working around, we changed -a not to apply to the standard library.
CloseWithError causes the next Read (waking up a current blocked Read if needed) to return the provided err after all data has been read.
Code we downloaded and all code that depends on it needs to be evicted from the package cache so that the information will be recomputed.
Encoding and decoding functions and methods that do not return an error either use panic to report an error or are guaranteed error-free.
Fields are guaranteed to be in the correct http2 order and not have unknown pseudo header fields or invalid header field names or values.
Filenames are case sensitive, but that doesn't matter because the case registered with Add is also the same case used with LoadDLL later.
FilterSamplesByName filters the samples in a profile and only keeps samples where at least one frame matches focus but none match ignore.
For now, it handles only the trivial case in which a Value with one or fewer args is only used in a single Block, and not in a phi value.
However, when we do lookups into this table we'll be using bits from a field element and therefore the bits will be in the reverse order.
If FieldsPerRecord is 0, Read sets it to the number of fields in the first record, so that future records must have the same field count.
If any of this module's typelinks match a type from a prior module, prefer that prior type by adding the offset to this module's typemap.
If f.sharp is set a raw (backquoted) string may be returned instead if the string does not contain any control characters other than tab.
If it is possible to remove an input without changing any other inputs, a later build will think the object is up-to-date when it is not.
If one argument to the comparison is an empty string, comparing the lengths instead will yield the same result without the function call.
If runtime triggers a forced GC during this test then it will deadlock, since the goroutines can't be stopped/preempted during spin wait.
If the P is not executing code (it is idle or in a syscall), this will call fn(p) directly while preventing the P from exiting its state.
If there are multiple instances of a match at the same depth, they annihilate each other and inhibit any possible match at a lower level.
If typ is still an untyped and not the final type, updateExprType only updates the recorded untyped type for x and possibly its operands.
If we aren't the first proxy retain prior X-Forwarded-For information as a comma+space separated list and fold multiple headers into one.
If we want to go with the dynamic encoding, we should count at least one offset to be sure that the offset huffman tree could be encoded.
If we're in the GC mark phase, can safely scan and blacken objects, and have work to do, run idle-time marking rather than give up the P.
If we're not tracking a word in a variable, mark the rest as having its address taken, so that we keep the whole thing live at all calls.
In blocking mode, write barriers are not allowed after this point because we must preserve the condition that the work buffers are empty.
In contrast to strconv/decimal.go, only right shift is implemented in decimal format - left shift can be done precisely in binary format.
In the interests of simplicity and determinism, this code does not attempt to reset the record size once the connection is idle, however.
In the uncontended case, as fast as spin locks (just a few user-level instructions), but on the contention path they sleep in the kernel.
IsARM64CMP reports whether the op (as defined by an arm.A* constant) is one of the comparison instructions that require special handling.

IsTrue reports whether the value is 'true', in the sense of not the zero of its type, and whether the value has a meaningful truth value.
Issue 10886: tests that all connection attempts return when more than DB.maxOpen connections are in flight and the first DB.maxOpen fail.
Issue 3899: 8g incorrectly thinks a variable is "set but not used" and elides an assignment, causing variables to end up with wrong data.
It gradually increases the number of benchmark iterations until the benchmark runs for a second in order to get a reasonable measurement.
It is used to compute an accurate line number for a formatted construct, independent of pending (not yet emitted) whitespace or comments.
Keep the fibbers in dedicated operating system threads, so that this program tests coordination between pthreads and not just goroutines.
Left padding with zeros has already been handled like precision earlier or the f.zero flag is ignored due to an explicitly set precision.
Must not call other functions nor access heap/globals in the loop, otherwise under race detector the samples will be in the race runtime.
NOTE(rsc): This doesn't actually trigger, because order.go has pulled all the len and cap calls into separate assignments to temporaries.
Normally the signal goes to the C thread, the Go signal handler picks it up, sees that it is running in a C thread, and the program dies.
Note width of xxx depends on value of constant bitsPerOutputInTag -- expect 2 or 3, so in practice the tag cache array is 64 or 128 long.
On ARM, the update of g must be made in two places (in R10 and also in a TLS slot), so the delayed update would need to be the SP update.
On a 64-bit machine, however, the 8-byte allocation is just one word, so the second bit pair is not available for encoding the checkmark.
On mips64x, stack frame is two words and there's a saved LR between SP and the stack frame and between the stack frame and the arguments.
One way to view this behavior is that it is as if 'go install' first runs 'go build' and the moves the generated file to the install dir.
Other than variable substitution and quoted-string evaluation, no special processing such as "globbing" is performed on the command line.
Other uses of LOCK are invalid and cause a processor exception, in contrast to the "just ignore it" spirit applied to all other prefixes.
Package-specific flags should be set using the directives, not the environment variables, so that builds work in unmodified environments.
RFC 7230 3.3.2 says "A sender MUST NOT send a Content-Length header field in any message that contains a Transfer-Encoding header field."
Reasons why RemoveAll might succeed in removing dpath as well include: running as root running on a file system without permissions (FAT)
Rename top-level old to new, both unresolved names (probably defined in another file) and names that resolve to a declaration we renamed.
Resolve the race between forEachP running the safe-point function on this P's behalf and this P running the safe-point function directly.
Scanf, Fscanf and Sscanf require that (after skipping spaces) newlines in the format are matched by newlines in the input and vice versa.
See "High Performance Web Networking", Chapter 4, or: https://www.igvita.com/2013/10/24/optimizing-tls-record-size-and-buffering-latency/
Since the reference implementation will always generate fresh random numbers, large parts of the reference connection will always change.
Strings must be UTF-8 encoded and may only contain Unicode code points U+0001 through U+00FF, due to limitations of the GZIP file format.
SysUnused notifies the operating system that the contents of the memory region are no longer needed and can be reused for other purposes.
TODO: Using the value ID as the class ignores the fact that value IDs get recycled and that some values are transmuted into other values.
TODO: let getReadBuf be configurable, and use a less memory-pinning allocator in server.go to minimize memory pinned for many idle conns.
TODO: this test fails, but it's just because fakeConn implements the optional Execer interface, so arguably this is the correct behavior.
TestMulUnbalanced tests that multiplying numbers of different lengths does not cause deep recursion and in turn allocate too much memory.
The data appended to dst does not begin with the prefix nor any indentation, to make it easier to embed inside other formatted JSON data.
The details vary depending on the underlying system, and by default, godoc will display the syscall documentation for the current system.
The killer problem, though, for mtime-based build systems is that the build only has access to the mtimes of the inputs that still exist.
The lhs elements are only set up after the for loop below, but that's ok because declareVar only collects the declInfo for a later phase.
The linker can prune methods that are not directly called or assigned to interfaces, but only if reflect.Type.MethodByName is never used.
The name must be a relative path: it must not start with a drive letter (e.g. C:) or leading slash, and only forward slashes are allowed.
The primary use of syscall is inside other packages that provide a more portable interface to the system, such as "os", "time" and "net".
The rand parameter is used as a source of entropy to ensure that encrypting the same message twice doesn't result in the same ciphertext.
The rules are the same as for /internal/ except that a path ending in /vendor is not subject to the rules, only subdirectories of vendor.
The source files foo/f.go, foo/bar/x.go, and foo/quux/y.go can all import "foo/internal/baz", but the source file crash/bang/b.go cannot.
They are not necessary in the spec definition of terminating, because a continue statement cannot be the final statement before a return.
This file contains the code to check range loop variables bound inside function literals that are deferred or launched in new goroutines.
This means that stack unwinding may not work entirely correctly (https://golang.org/issue/5723) but the user is running under gdb anyhow.
To get the absolute address of the value this rip-relative address is pointing to, we must add the address of the next instruction to it.
Typically, the Location represents the collection of time offsets in use in a geographical area, such as CEST and CET for central Europe.
URLQueryEscaper returns the escaped value of the textual representation of its arguments in a form suitable for embedding in a URL query.
Using start as the element tag is not required, but doing so will enable Unmarshal to match the XML elements to the correct struct field.
Verify that the SourcePos mode emits correct //line comments by testing that position information for matching identifiers is maintained.
We must be very careful here to not touch sel after we have unlocked the last lock, because sel can be freed right after the last unlock.
We still permit the old way, but we also permit this hack: if a Header() key begins with "Trailer:", the suffix of that key is a Trailer.
We test the "grow" and "no grow" paths separately, but not the "normal" (occasionally grow) path, because it is a blend of the other two.
We used to look at specific warning or error messages here, but that tied the behavior too closely to specific versions of the compilers.
While Scan stringifies all numbers scanned from numeric database columns into *string, scans into numeric types are checked for overflow.
commit applies changes to actions and template calls needed to contextually autoescape content and adds any derived templates to the set.
exactly16Bytes truncates the string if necessary so it is at most 16 bytes long, then pads the result with spaces to be exactly 16 bytes.
gcc's DWARF generator outputs a single DotDotDotType parameter for function pointers that specify no parameters (e.g. void (*__cgo_0)()).
go:cgo_import_static x_cgo_thread_start go:linkname x_cgo_thread_start x_cgo_thread_start go:linkname _cgo_thread_start _cgo_thread_start
if the instruction used more than 4 bytes, then it must have used a very large offset to update R13, so we need to additionally mask R13.
pushdcl pushes the current declaration for symbol s (if any) so that it can be shadowed by a new declaration within a nested block scope.
set receiver TODO(gri) Ideally, we should use a named type here instead of typ, for less verbose printing of interface method signatures.
singleStringReplacer is the implementation that's used when there is only one string to replace (and that string has more than one byte).
sleep sleeps for one tick, where a tick is a conservative estimate of how long it takes for a file modification to get a different mtime.
transportDefaultStreamFlow is how many stream-level flow control tokens we announce to the peer, and how many bytes we buffer per stream.
typ.size is the number of words in the object, and typ.ptrdata is the number of words in the prefix of the object that contains pointers.
(This is the name of a temporary file.) Because we run the temporary file in 'go run' and 'go test', the name will show up in ps listings.
+build ignore The gen command generates Go code (in the parent directory) for all the architecture-specific opcodes, blocks, and rewrites.
-outputdir directory Place output files from profiling in the specified directory, by default the directory in which "go test" is running.
A Config only specifies a width and height (two integers) while an image.Image's Bounds method returns an image.Rectangle (four integers).
A reference to an out of range or unmatched index or a name that is not present in the regular expression is replaced with an empty slice.
After popping the element, apply any undo records from the stack to restore the name translations that existed before we saw this element.
All the pkg-config directives are concatenated and sent to pkg-config simultaneously to add to each appropriate set of command-line flags.
Announce we are entering a system call so that the scheduler knows to create another M to run goroutines while we are in the foreign code.
BasicAuth returns the username and password provided in the request's Authorization header, if the request uses HTTP Basic Authentication.
Because immediate instruction arguments can follow the PC-relative memory reference in the instruction encoding, the two may not coincide.
Both kinds of deltas are sent as variable-length little-endian base-128 integers, where the 0x80 bit indicates that the integer continues.
Clang embeds prototypes for some builtin functions, like malloc and calloc, but all size_t parameters are incorrectly typed unsigned long.
Date returns the Time corresponding to yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss + nsec nanoseconds in the appropriate zone for that time in the given location.
DetectContentType implements the algorithm described at http://mimesniff.spec.whatwg.org/ to determine the Content-Type of the given data.
Do not require key to be exported, so that DeepEqual and other programs can use all the keys returned by MapKeys as arguments to MapIndex.
Each of these observations is a single word-sized read (first c.closed and second c.recvq.first or c.qcount depending on kind of channel).
EncodeToken does not call Flush, because usually it is part of a larger operation such as Encode, and those will call Flush when finished.
Encrypting with one member of the semi-weak pair and then encrypting the result with the other member should reproduce the original input.
For each such word, find all the other tracked stack words in the same Go variable (struct/slice/string/interface) and mark them live too.
For example, "go build -tags netgo myprog.go" would use the installed copy of package net, even if that copy had been built without netgo.
HasGoBuild reports whether the current system can build programs with ``go build'' and then run them with os.StartProcess or exec.Command.
However, this means that the result is fragile and must be converted to Pointer immediately after making the call, in the same expression:
If an encountered value implements the Marshaler interface and is not a nil pointer, Marshal calls its MarshalJSON method to produce JSON.
If the last comment begins with "Unordered output:" then the output is compared to the comment, however the order of the lines is ignored.
If the operand is a reflect.Value, the operand is replaced by the concrete value that it holds, and printing continues with the next rule.
If the result exceeds the maximum (or minimum) value that can be stored in a Duration, the maximum (or minimum) duration will be returned.
If this text function exited too early (and its defer log.SetOutput(os.Stderr) ran), then the crash output could spill into the next test.
If we've run out of peek buffer and the boundary wasn't found (and can't possibly fit), we must have hit the end of the file unexpectedly.
Indeed, the definition for _cgo_gcc_Cfunc_sin will be provided to the host linker by foo2.cgo.o, which in turn will need the symbol 'sin'.
It also avoids duplicated effort: if we didn't find the field in an embedded type T at level 2, we won't find it in one at level 4 either.
It exists because so a closeWaiter value can be placed inside a larger struct and have the Mutex and Cond's memory in the same allocation.
It is intended that the user of this function generate a random session key beforehand and continue the protocol with the resulting value.
It rounds the result assuming that the original was obtained from a floating-point value of bitSize bits (32 for float32, 64 for float64).
Minor for-the-time-being optimization: nothing happens unless a loop is both inner and call-free, therefore don't bother with other loops.
NOTE(uid): SECBUG(uid): sec hole 0 need to fix asap Multiple notes may be in the same comment group and should be recognized individually.
NYCbCrA represents a non-alpha-premultiplied Y'CbCr-with-alpha color, having 8 bits each for one luma, two chroma and one alpha component.
Notes on stable sorting: The used algorithms are simple and provable correct on all input and use only logarithmic additional stack space.
On Linux the SOCK_NONBLOCK and SOCK_CLOEXEC flags were introduced in 2.6.27 kernel and on FreeBSD both flags were introduced in 10 kernel.
Otherwise, on weakly ordered machines, the garbage collector could follow a pointer to x, but see uninitialized memory or stale heap bits.
Passing a pointer to a pointer field of a Go struct, where the field does not contain a Go pointer, but another field (irrelevantly) does.
ReadBytes reads until the first occurrence of delim in the input, returning a slice containing the data up to and including the delimiter.
Repeat emits an instruction to repeat the description of the last n words c times (including the initial description, c+1 times in total).
Scanning consumes pointers to grey objects, thus blackening them, and then scans them, potentially producing new pointers to grey objects.
StackSystem is a number of additional bytes to add to each stack below the usual guard area for OS-specific purposes like signal handling.
TLS reference tests run a connection against a reference implementation (OpenSSL) of TLS and record the bytes of the resulting connection.
TODO: maybe switch to RWMutex TODO: add support for sharing conns based on cert names (e.g. share conn for googleapis.com and appspot.com)
Test converting a type defined in a different package to an interface defined in a third package, where the interface has a hidden method.
The Go code, during a test, is configured with deterministic randomness and so the reference test can be reproduced exactly in the future.
The caller is responsible for acquiring worldsema and disabling preemption first and then should stopTheWorldWithSema on the system stack:
The field number is defined by the type of the encoded struct: the first field of the encoded type is field 0, the second is field 1, etc.
The files in the testdata directory are parsed and the errors reported are compared against the error messages expected in the test files.
The following example shows how to maintain a scalable frequently read, but infrequently updated data structure using copy-on-write idiom.
The frontend gets rid of the write barrier to enable the special OAPPEND handling above, but since this is not a special case, we need it.
The methods of embedded interfaces are always "inlined" by the compiler and thus embedded interfaces are never visible in the export data.
The original C code, the long comment, and the constants below are from FreeBSD's /usr/src/lib/msun/src/e_exp.c and came with this notice.
The original C code, the long comment, and the constants below are from FreeBSD's /usr/src/lib/msun/src/e_log.c and came with this notice.
There are relocations, so this must be a normal object file, and we only look at section symbols, so we assume that the symbol value is 0.
There is a tiny window where this is possible, between the connecting dying and the persistConn readLoop calling Transport.removeIdleConn.
These constants are defined by the Snappy implementation so that its assembly implementation can fast-path some 16-bytes-at-a-time copies.
This affinity helps eliminate moves that are required for phi implementations and helps generate allocations for 2-register architectures.
This does not match what most callers expect so we must return an error here rather than letting the caller think that the call succeeded.
This is a rare case, arising only when we're trying to give memory back to the operating system, which happens on a time scale of minutes.
To make it work, call os/signal.Notify for syscall.SIGPROF, but note that doing so may break any profiling being done by the main program.
To make static symbols unique across all files being read, we replace version 1 with the version corresponding to the current file number.
Tracing won't work reliably for architectures where cputicks is emulated by nanotime, so the value doesn't matter for those architectures.
Unmarshal maps an XML element to a pointer by setting the pointer to a freshly allocated value and then mapping the element to that value.
Using NewChunkedWriter inside a handler would result in double chunking or chunking with a Content-Length length, both of which are wrong.
Using newChunkedWriter inside a handler would result in double chunking or chunking with a Content-Length length, both of which are wrong.
We could use SecTrustEvaluate to verify that a trust chain exists for a certificate, but the x509 API requires returning the entire chain.
We expect errors since the server is hanging up on us after telling us to send more requests, so we don't actually care what the error is.
We need to assume an output context so that recursive template calls take the fast path out of escapeTree instead of infinitely recursing.
We still honor that reply (see TestIssue3595), but don't send future requests on the connection because it's then in a questionable state.
compose modifies t such that it respects the previously-registered hooks in old, subject to the composition policy requested in t.Compose.

internetAddrList resolves addr, which may be a literal IP address or a DNS name, and returns a list of internet protocol family addresses.
launch with `go run arithBoundaryGen.go` a file called arithBoundary_ssa.go will be written into the parent directory containing the tests
local error wrapper so we can distinguish errors we want to return as errors from genuine panics (which we don't want to return as errors)
readImports is like ioutil.ReadAll, except that it expects a Go file as input and stops reading the input once the imports have completed.
recordSizeBoostThreshold is the number of bytes of application data sent after which the TLS record size will be increased to the maximum.
refillaCache takes 8 bytes s.allocBits starting at whichByte and negates them so that ctz (count trailing zeros) instructions can be used.
selectClientCertSignatureAlgorithm returns a signatureAndHash to sign a client's CertificateVerify with, or an error if none can be found.
testFile tests that compressing and then decompressing the given file with the given options yields equivalent bytes to the original file.
tracebackCgoContext handles tracing back a cgo context value, from the context argument to setCgoTraceback, for the gentraceback function.
use negative length to indicate unnamed parameters (look at the first parameter only since either all names are present or all are absent)
(2) we don't know what pointers might point at them and we want loads via those pointers to see updated values and vice versa (issue 7995).
(The other candidate would be map access, but map access returns a pointer to the result data instead of taking a pointer to be filled in.)
- For throughput-sensitive applications, such as large file transfers, larger TLS records better amortize framing and encryption overheads.
A negative precision selects the smallest number of decimal digits necessary to identify the value x uniquely using x.Prec() mantissa bits.
After we receive an event for a file descriptor, it's our responsibility to ask again to be notified for future events for that descriptor.
An error is returned if caused by client policy (such as CheckRedirect), or failure to speak HTTP (such as a network connectivity problem).
As Go doesn't have support for C's union type in the general case, C's union types are represented as a Go byte array with the same length.
As a special case, ServeFile redirects any request where r.URL.Path ends in "/index.html" to the same path, without the final "index.html".
As a special case, the returned file server redirects any request ending in "/index.html" to the same path, without the final "index.html".
BUG(rsc,mikio): On DragonFly BSD and OpenBSD, listening on the "tcp" and "udp" networks does not listen for both IPv4 and IPv6 connections.
Boolean flags may be: 1, 0, t, f, T, F, true, false, TRUE, FALSE, True, False Duration flags accept any input valid for time.ParseDuration.
CBC provides confidentiality by xoring (chaining) each plaintext block with the previous ciphertext block before applying the block cipher.
Changing the behavior of signals in Go programs The functions in this package allow a program to change the way Go programs handle signals.
Expected errors are indicated in the test files by putting a comment of the form /* ERROR "rx" */ immediately following an offending token.
For a one pass prog, the fundamental condition that must be true is: at any InstAlt, there must be no ambiguity about what branch to  take.
If ReadBytes encounters an error before finding a delimiter, it returns the data read before the error and the error itself (often io.EOF).
If all flag is set true or if no flags are set true, set all the non-experimental ones not explicitly set (in effect, set the "-all" flag).
If any candidates were rejected then errCert will be set to one of them, arbitrarily, and err will contain the reason that it was rejected.
If parameter content escapes to heap, set EscContentEscapes Note minor confusion around escape from pointer-to-struct vs escape from struct
If the non-Go code installs a signal handler for any of the asynchronous signals, it may invoke the Go signal handler or not as it chooses.
If the request has an "Expect: 100-continue" header and the server responds 100 Continue, readLoop send a value to writeLoop via this chan.
If the value is a map and the keys are of basic type with a defined order ("comparable"), the elements will be visited in sorted key order.
If v's Kind is Func, the returned pointer is an underlying code pointer, but not necessarily enough to identify a single function uniquely.
If we're writing the result of an append back to the same slice, handle it specially to avoid write barriers on the fast (non-growth) path.
Initializers referring to variables related by an initialization dependency appear in topological order, the others appear in source order.
Instead, when the preempt flag is set, this puts itself into _Gwaiting to be woken up by gcController.findRunnable at the appropriate time.
Issue 4316: the stack overflow check in the linker is confused when it encounters a split-stack function that needs 0 bytes of stack space.
It is a historical artifact, kept for binary compatibility and exported only for the benefit of the package's encoding of type descriptors.
It is up to fn to arrange for that later execution, typically by recording g in a data structure, causing something to call ready(g) later.
MustHaveGoBuild checks that the current system can build programs with ``go build'' and then run them with os.StartProcess or exec.Command.
NOTE(rsc): passing nil for argtype means that the copying of the results back into cb.arg happens without any corresponding write barriers.
On return ninit has the parameter assignments, the nbody is the inlined function body and list, rlist contain the input, output parameters.
Otherwise, the Go handler removes itself, unblocks the signal, and raises it again, to invoke any non-Go handler or default system handler.
Reset discards the Reader z's state and makes it equivalent to the result of its original state from NewReader, but reading from r instead.
Scanf scans text read from standard input, storing successive space-separated values into successive arguments as determined by the format.
SizedReaderAt is the interface that groups the basic ReadAt method with a Size method that reports the total size of the underlying object.
StateMonitor maintains a map that stores the state of the URLs being polled, and prints the current state every updateInterval nanoseconds.
Strings and slices that don't escape and fit into tmpBuf are stack allocated, which defeats using AllocsPerRun to test other optimizations.
TODO(brainman): decide if start parameter should be int instead of uint32 String extracts string from COFF string table st at offset start.
TODO(gri) Consider also using a method set cache for the lifetime of checker once we rely on MethodSet lookup instead of individual lookup.
TODO: test 5 pipelined requests with responses: 1) OK, 2) OK, Connection: Close and then verify that the final 2 responses get errors back.
TempDir creates a new temporary directory in the directory dir with a name beginning with prefix and returns the path of the new directory.
Test case for issue 1550: a type cannot implement an interface from another package with a private method, and type assertions should fail.
That means the file must be in the build package's GoFiles or CgoFiles list only (no tag-ignored files, tests, swig or other non-Go files).
The CPU times for mark/scan are broken down in to assist time (GC performed in line with allocation), background GC time, and idle GC time.
The association needs to be done at this early point because we need to process the I/O readiness notification at some point in the future.
The following members of template are used: Subject, Attributes, SignatureAlgorithm, Extensions, DNSNames, EmailAddresses, and IPAddresses.
The hardware delivers a different kind of fault for a malformed address than it does for an attempt to access a valid but unmapped address.
The http Client and Transport guarantee that Body is always non-nil, even on responses without a body or responses with a zero-length body.
The random parameter is used as a source of entropy to ensure that encrypting the same message twice doesn't result in the same ciphertext.
The total number of bytes in all the ranges is larger than the size of the file by itself, so this is probably an attack, or a dumb client.
Their HTTP client may or may not be able to read this if we're responding to them and hanging up while they're still writing their request.
These constants are copied from the flate package, so that code that imports "compress/gzip" does not also have to import "compress/flate".
These constants are copied from the flate package, so that code that imports "compress/zlib" does not also have to import "compress/flate".
These tables were generated by cut and paste from Appendix B of the XML spec at http://www.xml.com/axml/testaxml.htm and then reformatting.
They all have default behaviors that use the local file system, so clients need only set the functions whose behaviors they wish to change.
They're capped at the min of the peer's max frame size or 512KB (kinda arbitrarily), but definitely capped so we don't allocate 4GB bufers.
This file is compiled as ordinary Go code, but it is also input to mksyscall, which parses the //sys lines and generates system call stubs.
This means that directories containing parse errors will be built (and fail) instead of being silently skipped as not matching the pattern.
This package's compressor uses a higher minimum match length, enabling optimizations such as finding matches via 32-bit loads and compares.
This returns the number of bytes copied and may be less than the requested length if the available space in the output buffer is too small.
This so-called leftmost-longest matching is the same semantics that early regular expression implementations used and that POSIX specifies.
This, combined with the runtime/zversion content, will cause packages to have different build IDs when compiled with different Go releases.
Unfortunately, there are a variety of ways in which the mtime approach fails to detect a change and reuses a stale object file incorrectly.
We could use ReadDotBytes and then Split it, but reading a line at a time avoids needing a large contiguous block of memory and is simpler.
We have a block (statement list), but it may have several basic blocks due to the appearance of statements that affect the flow of control.
connectMethodKey is the map key version of connectMethod, with a stringified proxy URL (or the empty string) instead of a pointer to a URL.
decComplex64 decodes a pair of unsigned integers, treats them as a pair of floating point numbers, and stores them as a complex64 in value.
determine if we've only got a single phi in this block, this is easier to handle than the general case of a block with multiple phi values.
expandKey is used by BenchmarkExpand to ensure that the asm implementation of key expansion is used for the benchmark when it is available.
finishsweep_m moves the previous arena to the free arena, the current arena to the previous arena, and the next arena to the current arena.
if we're the last chunk, make sure we've exhausted the name otherwise we'll give a false result even if we could still match using the star
separator is an empty //-style comment that is interspersed between different comment groups when they are concatenated into a single group
spec: "With the exception of specific built-in functions, function and method calls and receive operations can appear in statement context.
substArgTypes substitutes the given list of types for successive occurrences of the "any" placeholder in the type syntax expression n.Type.
x is an untyped value representable by a value of type T TODO(gri) This is borrowing from checker.convertUntyped and checker.representable.
(Foo starts with a capital letter so it cannot match a package path.) go doc encoding/json Show documentation for the encoding/json package.
(Making the opposite mistake, rebuilding unnecessarily, is only a performance problem and not a correctness problem, so we ignore that one.)
64-bit math without using 64-bit numbers, so that we can generate the test program even if the compiler has buggy or missing 64-bit support.
A *rtype representing a struct is followed directly in memory by an array of method objects representing the methods attached to the struct.
Call g with small arguments so that there is something predictable (and different from the correct results) in those positions on the stack.
Currently build modes c-shared, pie, and -linkshared force external linking mode, and external linking mode forces an import of runtime/cgo.
Cut this off safely by making minLevel sticky: once you get that deep, you cannot go down any further but you also cannot go up any further.
DecryptPEMBlock takes a password encrypted PEM block and the password used to encrypt it and returns a slice of decrypted DER encoded bytes.
ERROR "index bounds check elided" Right shift cuts the effective number of bits in the index, but only for unsigned (signed stays negative).
However, a valid preamble line is not a valid header line, therefore we cannot have consumed the preamble line for the any subsequent block.
If GC kept a bit for whether there were any marks in a span, we could release these free spans at the end of GC and eliminate this entirely.
If ReadString encounters an error before finding a delimiter, it returns the data read before the error and the error itself (often io.EOF).
If a rebuild is needed but produces the previous __.PKGDEF, then no more recompilation due to the rebuilt package is needed, only relinking.
If initsig does not install a signal handler for a signal, then to go back to the state before Notify we should remove the one we installed.
If old is empty, it matches at the beginning of the slice and after each UTF-8 sequence, yielding up to k+1 replacements for a k-rune slice.
If the error is that the source file didn't begin with a package line and source fragments are ok, fall through to try as a source fragment.
If the filter returns a non-nil error, the execution of system call will be canceled and the system call function returns the non-nil error.
If the last entry had a sibling attribute, that attribute gives the offset of the next sibling, so we can avoid decoding the child subtrees.
If there is no Content-Length or chunked Transfer-Encoding on a *Response and the status is not 1xx, 204 or 304, then the body is unbounded.
In that case, if the second (error) return value evaluates to non-nil during execution, execution terminates and Execute returns that error.
In the block that follows a regexp, each line gives the semicolon-separated match results of running the regexp on the corresponding string.
In the event of a cache miss, an entry must be evicted from the hash table, copied to a log that will eventually be written as profile data.
In these words, if a bit pair with a high bit 0 is encountered, the low bit can also be assumed to be 0, and the object description is over.
In this case, the argument f, typically a closure, captures the value to be searched for, and how the data structure is indexed and ordered.
IsMIPS64MUL reports whether the op (as defined by an mips.A* constant) is one of the MUL/DIV/REM instructions that require special handling.
It is important that the scan happens exactly once: if called twice, the installation of stack barriers will detect the double scan and die.
It was changed at the time of Go 1.1 release because the former User-Agent had ended up on a blacklist for some intrusion detection systems.
Lookahead can be called during grammar actions to read (but not consume) the value of the current lookahead token, as returned by yylex.Lex.
Most clients should use the runtime/pprof package or the testing package's -test.blockprofile flag instead of calling BlockProfile directly.
NOTE: we resend a request only if the request is idempotent, we reused a keep-alive connection, and we haven't yet received any header data.
Note that using CGI means starting a new process to handle each request, which is typically less efficient than using a long-running server.
Note that we are using codegen both as a temporary variable for holding a copy of the frequencies, and as the place where we put the result.
Nothing is racing with us now, but gcscandone might be set to true left over from an earlier round of stack scanning (we scan twice per GC).
Notify disables the default behavior for a given set of asynchronous signals and instead delivers them over one or more registered channels.
Otherwise, the importer must load the package data for the given path into a new *Package, record it in imports map, and return the package.
ReadString reads until the first occurrence of delim in the input, returning a string containing the data up to and including the delimiter.
Sadly, that's not guaranteed to hold the note, because there is an arbitrary amount of other junk placed in the file ahead of the main text.
Scope returns the (complete or incomplete) package scope holding the objects declared at package level (TypeNames, Consts, Vars, and Funcs).
Seeking to any positive offset is legal, but the behavior of subsequent I/O operations on the underlying object is implementation-dependent.
Single quotes and double quotes are recognized to prevent splitting within the quoted region, and are removed from the resulting substrings.
Sorting the packages is not necessary but to compare binaries created using textual and binary format we sort by path to reduce differences.
StripPrefix returns a handler that serves HTTP requests by removing the given prefix from the request URL's Path and invoking the handler h.
TODO(rsc): We may be able to merge various of the memory operands since we don't care about, say, the distinction between m80dec and m80bcd.
TODO: It would be nice if ExecError was more broken down, but the way ErrorContext embeds the template name makes the processing too clumsy.
TestIPv4MulticastListener tests both single and double listen to a test listener with same address family, same group address and same port.
TestIPv6MulticastListener tests both single and double listen to a test listener with same address family, same group address and same port.
That is, the package presented is the one that matches the search and is nearest the root and lexically first at its level of the hierarchy.
The Reader will return a ErrChecksum when Read reaches the end of the uncompressed data if it does not have the expected length or checksum.
The avarinit output serves as a signal that the data has been initialized, because any use of a variable must come after its initialization.
The buffer is stored with an extra indirection because it may be replaced if we load a type during decode (when reading an interface value).
The caller wanted to only load the filename DLL from the System32 directory but that facility doesn't exist, so just load it the normal way.
The fractional worker should run until it is preempted and will be scheduled to pick up the fractional part of GOMAXPROCS*gcGoalUtilization.

The statements prepared for a transaction by calling the transaction's Prepare or Stmt methods are closed by the call to Commit or Rollback.
This benchmark models a situation where spinning in the mutex should be non-profitable and allows to confirm that spinning does not do harm.
This file merely ensures that we link in runtime/cgo in race build, this is turn ensures that runtime uses pthread_create to create threads.
This format is slightly documented in "ELF for the ARM Architecture" but mostly this is derived from reading the source to gold and readelf.
This may no longer be necessary now that we run escape analysis after wrapper generation, but for 1.5 this is conservatively left unchanged.
Unlike runtime.Callers, the PC values returned should, when passed to the symbolizer function, return the file/line of the call instruction.
Unlike the drawCopyOver function, we don't have to check the x coordinates because the built-in copy function can handle overlapping slices.
Unlike with tests, we ignore the -chatty flag and always print output for benchmarks since the output generation time will skew the results.
Unused result of certain function calls Flag: -unusedresult Calls to well-known functions and methods that return a value that is discarded.
We arrange things very carefully to have to/from conversions on either side of the call which cannot be combined with any other conversions.
We do this after re-checking the transition condition so that multiple goroutines that detect the heap trigger don't start multiple STW GCs.
We only this when looking at a value on the stack when the type uses a GC program, because otherwise it's more efficient to use the GC bits.
When calculating hashes over objects, it's important that the resulting bytes be the same at both ends and DER removes this margin of error.
aesCipherGCM implements crypto/cipher.gcmAble so that crypto/cipher.NewGCM will use the optimised implementation in this file when possible.
argNum returns total number of args for the event accounting for timestamps, sequence numbers and differences between trace format versions.
context describes the state an HTML parser must be in when it reaches the portion of HTML produced by evaluating a particular template node.
determine if z can be reused TODO(gri) should find a better solution - this if statement is very costly (see e.g. time pidigits -s -n 10000)
enumModRM generates all possible modrm bytes and, for modrm values that indicate a following sib byte, all possible modrm, sib combinations.
findDirectory64End tries to read the zip64 locator just before the directory end and returns the offset of the zip64 directory end if found.
getDecEnginePtr cached engine for ut.base instead of ut.user so we passed a *map and then tried to reuse its engine to decode the inner map.
id identifies a package, usually by a canonical package path like "encoding/json" but possibly by a non-canonical import path like "./json".
if its a byte instruction that has unaddressable registers, try to exchange registers and reissue the instruction with the operands renamed.
jsValEscaper escapes its inputs to a JS Expression (section 11.14) that has neither side-effects nor free variables outside (NaN, Infinity).

mangleName does name mangling to translate names from the original Go source files to the names used in the final Go files generated by cgo.
reflect.Value handled specially in Go 1.5, making it possible to see inside non-exported fields (which cannot be accessed with Interface()).
syncadjustsudogs adjusts gp's sudogs and copies the part of gp's stack they refer to while synchronizing with concurrent channel operations.
they are not as small as the load commands, but we'll need the memory anyway for the symbol images, so we might as well use one large chunk.
they are not as small as the section lists, but we'll need the memory anyway for the symbol images, so we might as well use one large chunk.
A SettingsFrame conveys configuration parameters that affect how endpoints communicate, such as preferences and constraints on peer behavior.
A write to a broken pipe on file descriptors 1 or 2 (standard output or standard error) will cause the program to exit with a SIGPIPE signal.
Also short-circuit in (1) when the header's been sent and not in chunking mode, writing directly to (4) instead, if (2) has no buffered data.
And because Go's native resolver doesn't do mDNS or similar local resolution mechanisms, assume that libc might (via Avahi, etc) and use cgo.
But otherwise, if there is a non-empty locals section, the author of the code is responsible for making sure that the frame size is 8 mod 16.
Clear the pointers later in the array so that we can tell where the coalesced bitmaps stop and so that we don't double-free when cleaning up.
ErrNotFat is returned from NewFatFile or OpenFat when the file is not a universal binary but may be a thin binary, based on its magic number.
External linking avoids the dynamic library requirement but introduces a requirement that the host linker be present to create such a binary.
FieldByNameFunc returns the first struct field with a name that satisfies the match function and a boolean indicating if the field was found.
Filter returns a new comment map consisting of only those entries of cmap for which a corresponding node exists in the AST specified by node.
GobEncode returns a byte slice representing the encoding of the receiver for transmission to a GobDecoder, usually of the same concrete type.
HTTP client requests made with the returned context will use the provided trace hooks, in addition to any previous hooks registered with ctx.
If nospill is set the allocated register is marked nospill so the assignment cannot be undone until the caller allows it by clearing nospill.
If the caller will also sweep pages (e.g., for a large allocation), it can pass a non-zero callerSweepPages to leave that many pages unswept.
If the files belong to different packages, one package name is selected and files with different package names are reported and then ignored.
If this file only has one example function, some other top-level declarations, and no tests or benchmarks, use the whole file as the example.
If this section has already been set up as a note, we assume type_ and flags are already correct, but the other fields still need filling in.
IsARM64STLXR reports whether the op (as defined by an arm64.A* constant) is one of the STLXR-like instructions that require special handling.
It is defined in RFC 1950: Adler-32 is composed of two sums accumulated per byte: s1 is the sum of all bytes, s2 is the sum of all s1 values.
It is the caller's responsibility to arrange for it to be freed, such as by calling C.free (be sure to include stdlib.h if C.free is needed).
It should encompass all the languages with special casing rules and be generated automatically, but that requires some API development first.
It's hard to tease out exactly how big a Sigset is, but rt_sigprocmask crashes if we get it wrong, so if binaries are running, this is right.
Modified to not use any floating point arithmetic so that we don't clobber any floating-point registers while emulating the sqrt instruction.
NOTE: This function must be marked as a "wrapper" in the generated code, so that the linker can make it work correctly for panic and recover.
Note that all this complexity does not apply to global run queue as we are not sloppy about thread unparking when submitting to global queue.
Out of paranoia for making a late change in Go 1.6, we bound how long this can wait, since golang.org/issue/14291 isn't fully understood yet.
Phase 1: Collect explicitly declared methods, the corresponding signature (AST) expressions, and the list of embedded type (AST) expressions.
Profiling tests are inherently flaky, especially on a loaded system, such as when this test is running with several others under go test std.
Some uses of zeroed constants in non-assignment expressions broke with our more aggressive zeroing of assignments (internal compiler errors).
Specifically, we build a list of the inputs to the build, compute its SHA1 hash, and record that as the ``build ID'' in the generated object.
TLSNextProto optionally specifies a function to take over ownership of the provided TLS connection when an NPN protocol upgrade has occurred.
TODO(gri) Remove this function once we switched to new export format by default (and update the comment and want list in TestImportTestdata).
That data is platform-specific as it depends on the inlining decisions of the compiler and the representation of the inlined function bodies.
The assumption is that we're very unlikely to get an asynchronous SIGTRAP at just the moment that the PC started to point at unmapped memory.
The build process links this stub, along with _cgo_export.c and *.cgo2.c, into a dynamic executable and then lets cgo examine the executable.
The theory is that there wasn't enough work to do anyway, so we might as well let background marking take care of the work that is available.
Theoretically, this is a quadratic lookup algorithm, but in practice deeply nested composite types with unnamed component types are uncommon.
They are sent byte-reversed, with the exponent end coming out first, so integer floating point numbers (for example) transmit more compactly.
This assumes that the token run does not include any string tokens, comment tokens, regular expression literal tokens, or division operators.
This permits Unsetenv to safely delete only the first item without worrying about unshadowing a later one, which might be a security problem.
This test does not test whether the transport deals with too much data, though, since the server doesn't make it possible to send bogus data.
This will cause the code below to memclr the dead section of the final array element, so that scanobject can stop early in the final element.
Use context values only for request-scoped data that transits processes and API boundaries, not for passing optional parameters to functions.
Verify will fail if this slice is non-empty, unless verification is delegated to an OS library which understands all the critical extensions.
We can assume the existence of connected multicast route clones when at least two connected unicast routes, ::1/128 and other, are installed.
We have not factored the common code out because eventually uadd (and usub) should be optimized by special-casing, and the code will diverge.
We manually create a runtimeTimer to bypass the overflow detection logic in NewTimer: we're testing the underlying runtime.addtimer function.
When using search domains, return the error encountered querying the original name instead of an error encountered querying a generated name.
__ieee754_lgamma_r(x, signgamp) Reentrant version of the logarithm of the Gamma function with user provided pointer for the sign of Gamma(x).
a value resulting from taking the address of a value, or a value constructed from an offset of a non-nil ptr (OpAddPtr) implies it is non-nil
absDomainName returns an absolute domain name which ends with a trailing dot to match pure Go reverse resolver and all other lookup routines.
at this point we have something like: MOV* const/mem/reg, reg MOV* reg, reg/mem now check if this is a cast that cannot be forward propagated
cgocallback_gofunc is not called from go, only from cgocallback, so the arguments will be found via cgocallback's pointer-declared arguments.
decComplex128 decodes a pair of unsigned integers, treats them as a pair of floating point numbers, and stores them as a complex128 in value.
escapeListConditionally escapes a list node but only preserves edits and inferences in e if the inferences and output context satisfy filter.
geneq is only called for types that have equality but cannot be handled by the standard algorithms, so t must be either an array or a struct.

when the first reference to the literal pool threatens to go out of range of a 1Mb PC-relative offset drop the pool now, and branch round it.
"A server that receives a larger header block than it is willing to handle can send an HTTP 431 (Request Header Fields Too Large) status code"
-installsuffix suffix a suffix to use in the name of the package installation directory, in order to keep output separate from default builds.
66 F3 0F D6 C5, 66 F2 0F D6 C0: libopcodes reports use of XMM register instead of MMX register, but only when the instruction has a 66 prefix.
A write to a broken pipe on some other file descriptor will take no action on the SIGPIPE signal, and the write will fail with an EPIPE error.
After all data has been written, the client should call the Flush method to guarantee all data has been forwarded to the underlying io.Writer.
An OXDOT uses the Sym field to hold the field to the right of the dot, so s will be non-nil, but an OXDOT is never a valid struct literal key.
AppendRange should collapse each of the new ranges into the earlier ones (it looks back two ranges), so that the slice never grows very large.
As the doc comment says, the returned pointer is an underlying code pointer but not necessarily enough to identify a single function uniquely.
Because the copy has already happened, we call writebarrierptr_nostore, and this is nosplit so the copy and write barrier appear atomic to GC.
Both are type SELFGOT, so in that case we skip size comparison and fall through to the name comparison (conveniently, .got sorts before .toc).
But the effect of a tag on the build is to include or exclude a file from the compilation, and that file list is already in the build ID hash.
Copy headers to rw's headers, after we've decided not to go into handleInternalRedirect, which won't want its rw headers to have been touched.
CopyBuffer is identical to Copy except that it stages through the provided buffer (if one is required) rather than allocating a temporary one.
Disable registerization for results if using defer, because the deferred func might recover and return, causing the current values to be used.
Due to a detail of gc's internals, the huge constant errors happen in an earlier pass than the others and inhibits the next pass from running.
Each key is a non-empty string consisting of non-control characters other than space (U+0020 ' '), quote (U+0022 '"'), and colon (U+003A ':').
Here we depend on the fact that time.Duration's native unit is nanoseconds, so the pauses and the total pause time do not need any conversion.
If MaxOpenConns is greater than 0 but less than the new MaxIdleConns then the new MaxIdleConns will be reduced to match the MaxOpenConns limit
If host is omitted, as in ":8080", ListenPacket listens on all available interfaces instead of just the interface with the given host address.
If old is empty, it matches at the beginning of the string and after each UTF-8 sequence, yielding up to k+1 replacements for a k-rune string.
If the fallthrough instruction is xFail, advance the position so that the decoded instruction size includes the byte we just compared against.
In tokens returned by Decoder.Token, the Space identifier is given as a canonical URL, not the short prefix used in the document being parsed.
It is required because the tests contain a lot of data races on the same addresses (the tests are simple and the memory is constantly reused).
It's a bit baroque to remove a signal stack here only to add one in minit, but it's a simple change that keeps NetBSD working like other OS's.
Loop alignment constants: want to align loop entry to LoopAlign-byte boundary, and willing to insert at most MaxLoopPad bytes of NOP to do so.
MinPrec returns the minimum precision required to represent x exactly (i.e., the smallest prec before x.SetPrec(prec) would start rounding x).
NOTE(rsc): RFC 2616 says that the Location line must be an absolute URI, like "http://www.google.com/redirect/", not a path like "/redirect/".
Note that we don't request this for HEAD requests, due to a bug in nginx: http://trac.nginx.org/nginx/ticket/358 https://golang.org/issue/5522
Only used on x86 for CALL/JMP *sym(SB), which calls/jumps to a function pointer stored in the data word sym(SB), not a function named sym(SB).
R_JMPMIPS (only used on mips64) resolves to non-PC-relative target address of a JMP instruction, by encoding the address into the instruction.
SetBits provides raw (unchecked but fast) access to z by setting its value to abs, interpreted as a little-endian Word slice, and returning z.
Special case: explicit name of func (*T) method(...) is turned into pkg.(*T).method, but for export, this should be rendered as (*pkg.T).meth.
Stack phis start out life already spilled - each phi input must be a store (using StoreReg) at the end of the corresponding predecessor block.
TODO: keep a cache of these, mark entry/exit in escwalk to avoid allocation Or perhaps never mind, since it is disabled unless printing is on.
Test vectors are from FIPS 197: http://www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips197/fips-197.pdf Appendix A of FIPS 197: Key expansion examples
TestClientWriteShutdown tests that if the client shuts down the write side of their TCP connection, the server doesn't send a 400 Bad Request.
TestFloatAdd32 tests that Float.Add/Sub of numbers with 24bit mantissa behaves like float32 addition/subtraction (excluding denormal numbers).
The 'go test' command may run tests for different packages in parallel as well, according to the setting of the -p flag (see 'go help build').
The String method is used to print values passed as an operand to any format that accepts a string or to an unformatted printer such as Print.
The best reference for the differences between the Plan 9 format and the Go format is the runtime source, specifically ../../runtime/symtab.c.
The built-in copy function is faster than a straightforward for loop to fill the destination with the color, but copy requires a slice source.
The codeLength is 1+i, so shift code by 8-(1+i) to calculate the high bits for every 8-bit sequence whose codeLength's high bits matches code.
The effect is that the concatenation of a sequence of gzipped files is treated as equivalent to the gzip of the concatenation of the sequence.
The error built-in interface type is the conventional interface for representing an error condition, with the nil value representing no error.
The files are walked in lexical order, which makes the output deterministic but means that for very large directories Walk can be inefficient.
The first words are a header with the following data: 1st word -- 0 2nd word -- 3 3rd word -- 0 if a c++ application, 1 if a java application.
The following article describes an efficient (but much more complicated) implementation compatible with the internal representation used here:
The gc compiler implementation uses the minimally required 32bit binary exponent, so these constants cannot be represented anymore internally.
The result is rounded per the precision and rounding mode of z unless z's precision is 0, in which case z is set exactly to the decoded value.
These signal handlers will be invoked in cases where Go doesn't want to handle a particular signal (e.g., signal occurred on a non-Go thread).
This example demonstrates how to use big.Int to compute the smallest Fibonacci number with 100 decimal digits and to test whether it is prime.
This file encapsulates some of the odd characteristics of the ARM instruction set, to minimize its interaction with the core of the assembler.
This function rewalks the regexp tree and is called for every repetition, so we have to worry about inducing quadratic behavior in the parser.
This means that it should only be selected when the client indicates that it supports ECC with a curve and point format that we're happy with.
To avoid the binary search through tx, keep a static one-element cache that gives the correct zone for the time when the Location was created.
To do that, we mark all file descriptors close-on-exec and then, in the child, explicitly unmark the ones we want the exec'ed program to keep.
Unmarshal parses the XML-encoded data and stores the result in the value pointed to by v, which must be an arbitrary struct, slice, or string.
Usually these are constants, but the results of comparisons or non-constant shifts of untyped constants may also be untyped, but not constant.
We increment our line number (lines start at 1, not 0) and set column to -1 so as we increment in readRune it points to the character we read.
We're interpreting the args and locals bitmap instead of liveout so that we include the bits added by the avarinit logic in the previous loop.
With the -e flag, the list command never prints errors to standard error and instead processes the erroneous packages with the usual printing.
cas to 1 when at a background mark completion point Background mark completion signaling mode is the concurrency mode of the current GC cycle.
checkCopyLocksRange checks whether a range statement might inadvertently copy a lock by checking whether any of the range variables are locks.
findLabels gathers information about the labels defined and used by stmt and about which statements break, whether a label is involved or not.
gcBitsArenas.current becomes gcBitsArenas.previous where the span's gcAllocBits live until all the spans have been swept during this GC cycle.
remapLocationIDs ensures there is a location for each address referenced by a sample, and remaps the samples to point to the new location ids.
rewriteRef rewrites all the C.xxx references in f.AST to refer to the Go equivalents, now that we have figured out the meaning of all the xxx.
use position of expression following the comma as comma position for correct comment placement, but only if the expression is on the same line
(Don't get test dependencies for test dependencies.) We pass useVendor here because p.load does not vendor-expand TestImports and XTestImports.
A Reader implements the io.Reader, io.ReaderAt, io.Seeker, io.WriterTo, io.ByteScanner, and io.RuneScanner interfaces by reading from a string.
A direct call on the stack will cause gentraceback to stop walking the stack prematurely and if there are leftover stack barriers it may panic.
A line comment is a comment group that follows a non-comment token on the same line, and that has no tokens after it on the line where it ends.
Adding the letter v to an operation, as in pv or rv, enables verbose operation: For the c and r commands, names are printed as files are added.
All the varint and string reading code earlier should already catch overlong things and return ErrStringLength, but keep this as a last resort.
An encoder is an io.Writer that satisfies writes by writing PNG IDAT chunks, including an 8-byte header and 4-byte CRC checksum per Write call.
As initial capacity for readAll, use n + a little extra in case Size is zero, and to avoid another allocation after Read has filled the buffer.
Because of the Scan interface, this makes it impossible for the client to distinguish correctly encoded replacement runes from encoding errors.
CANotAuthorizedForThisName results when an intermediate or root certificate has a name constraint which doesn't include the name being checked.
Do not allow preemption here, because the garbage collector won't know the form of the arguments until the jmpdefer can flip the PC over to fn.
ERROR "slice: omit check for 1st index" "slice: result cap not computed" "slice: skip base adjustment for 1st index 0" "slice: len-only update"
Each call will leave the fields of the struct set to the same values they had upon return, except for the PC field when the More field is zero.
ErrConnClosed is returned by Read when a handler attempts to read the body of a request after the connection to the web server has been closed.
Eval will re-evaluate its argument each time, and it also does not know about the context in which an expression is used (e.g., an assignment).
Exponent underflow and overflow lead to a 0 or an Infinity for different values than IEEE-754 because Float exponents have a much larger range.
If AllErrors is not set, discard errors reported on the same line as the last recorded error and stop parsing if there are more than 10 errors.
If a Conn does not implement Execer, the sql package's DB.Exec will first prepare a query, execute the statement, and then close the statement.
If a WaitGroup is reused to wait for several independent sets of events, new Add calls must happen after all previous Wait calls have returned.
If none exist, more will indicate whether t contains any embedded fields at depth d, so callers can decide whether to retry at a greater depth.
If spinning is set, the caller has incremented nmspinning and startm will either decrement nmspinning or set m.spinning in the newly started M.
If that changes, compilation will fail (the constants in the composite literal will not fit in uint16) and the types here can change to uint32.
If the MOVD is not needed, insert a hardware NOP so that the same number of instructions are used on ppc64 in both shared and non-shared modes.
In fact if there is overflow/underflow, the corresponding code is unreachable because the known range is outside the range of the value's type.
In multiple calls to Parse with the same receiver template, only one call can contain text other than space, comments, and template definitions
It is off by default but set during all.bash so that installing the Go tree can run a sanity check but not spend time running exhaustive tests.
It's important to remember that ciphertexts must be authenticated (i.e. by using crypto/hmac) as well as being encrypted in order to be secure.
Most clients should use the runtime/pprof package or the testing package's -test.cpuprofile flag instead of calling SetCPUProfileRate directly.
Most commonly, this is a Go identifier naming an object declared within a package, but Syms are also used to name internal synthesized objects.
NOTE: If we wanted to be clever, we could arrange for just one temporary per distinct type, sharing the temp among all receives with that temp.
NOTE: Systems listed here should be only systems that support direct TLS references like 8(TLS) implemented as direct references from FS or GS.
Note that the shell tries all possible file extensions in a specific directory before moving on to search the next directory (if there is one).
Note: Since gobs can be stored permanently, it is good design to guarantee the encoding used by a GobEncoder is stable as the software evolves.
Note: This code detects (some) cycles created via pointers but not cycles that are created via slices or maps containing the same slice or map.
On Mac OS X Mountain Lion, we must sort exported symbols So we sort them here and pre-allocate dynid for them See https://golang.org/issue/4029
Once we have decided on a set of inputs, we must next decide how to tell whether the content of that set has changed since the last build of p.
Package signal will not block sending to c: the caller must ensure that c has sufficient buffer space to keep up with the expected signal rate.
Programs that need more control over error handling or large tokens, or must run sequential scans on a reader, should use bufio.Reader instead.
Record that after the current element is finished (that element is already pushed on the stack) Token should return EOF until popEOF is called.
See golang.org/s/go12symtab for header: 0xfffffffb, two zero bytes, a byte giving the PC quantum, and a byte giving the pointer width in bytes.
Similarly, the _all.o uses dynamic references to real system object code because cmd/link is not sophisticated enough to process the real code.
The Write method must be able to accept any amount of data, but it may operate more efficiently if all writes are a multiple of the block size.
The built-in table is small but on unix it is augmented by the local system's mime.types file(s) if available under one or more of these names:
The current implementation for little endian architectures is based on xadduintptr(), which is less than ideal: xadd64() should really be used.
The first address, and any with a matching label, are returned as primaries, while addresses with the opposite label are returned as fallbacks.
The recover in "defer recover()" is now a no-op, because it runs called from panic, not from the func, and therefore cannot see the panic of 2.
The rules are different: regardless of the underlying type's representation, we need to tell the other side that the base type is a GobEncoder.
This approach smooths out unjustified spikes of thread unparking, but at the same time guarantees eventual maximal CPU parallelism utilization.
This is to retain the order of type id allocation after a fix made to handle recursive types, which changed the order in which types are built.
This must be done after the type graph is constructed because it may need to resolve cycles in a different order than readType encounters them.
This program produced false race reports when run under the C/C++ ThreadSanitizer, as it did not understand the synchronization in the Go code.
Thus, for instance, for a slice it returns the length of the slice times the element size and does not count the memory occupied by the header.
ToLowerSpecial returns a copy of the string s with all Unicode letters mapped to their lower case, giving priority to the special casing rules.
ToTitleSpecial returns a copy of the string s with all Unicode letters mapped to their title case, giving priority to the special casing rules.
ToUpperSpecial returns a copy of the string s with all Unicode letters mapped to their upper case, giving priority to the special casing rules.
Unlike text/template, html/template crashed if given an incomplete template, that is, a template that had been named but not given any content.
We don't have to be constant time if the lengths of the MACs are different as that suggests that a completely different hash function was used.
Write Content-Length and/or Transfer-Encoding whose values are a function of the sanitized field triple (Body, ContentLength, TransferEncoding)
allPackagesInFS is like allPackages but is passed a pattern beginning ./ or ../, meaning it should scan the tree rooted at the given directory.
argument value: for TYPE_SCONST, a string for TYPE_FCONST, a float64 for TYPE_BRANCH, a *Prog (optional) for TYPE_TEXTSIZE, an int32 (optional)
clientSessionCacheKey returns a key used to cache sessionTickets that could be used to resume previously negotiated TLS sessions with a server.
finalBlock is a fresh slice which contains the contents of any suffix of payload as well as the needed padding to make finalBlock a full block.
for each predecessor of b, expand its list of live-at-end values invariant: s contains the values live at the start of b (excluding phi inputs)
genLine writes to buf a predictable but non-trivial line of text of length n, including the terminal newline and an occasional carriage return.
genhash is only called for types that have equality but cannot be handled by the standard algorithms, so t must be either an array or a struct.
importType returns the type denoted by the qualified identifier path.name, and adds the respective package to the imports map as a side effect.
increment locks to ensure that the goroutine is not preempted in the middle of sweep thus leaving the span in an inconsistent state for next GC
lostProfileData is a no-op function used in profiles to mark the number of profiling stack traces that were discarded due to slow data writers.

writeBlock writes a block of pixel data using the given quantization table, returning the post-quantized DC value of the DCT-transformed block.
A collection is triggered when the ratio of freshly allocated data to live data remaining after the previous collection reaches this percentage.
A valid response might be returned together with an ErrPersistEOF, which means that the remote requested that this be the last request serviced.
After Scan returns false, the Err method will return any error that occurred during scanning, except that if it was io.EOF, Err will return nil.
As Go uses bsdthread_register when running without cgo, this function is not safe to use after initialization as it does not pass an M as fnarg.
As a special exception, field and method names that are exported use the Sym associated with localpkg instead of the package that declared them.
As interface types are only used for static typing, a common idiom to find the reflection Type for an interface type Foo is to use a *Foo value.
At that point, future loads of that package must not pass useVendor, because disallowVendor will reject direct use of paths containing /vendor/.
BUG(uid): bug0 TODO(uid): todo0 A note with some spaces after it, should be ignored (watch out for emacs modes that remove trailing whitespace).
Because the data returned from ReadSlice will be overwritten by the next I/O operation, most clients should use ReadBytes or ReadString instead.
Beyond indicating the general state of a G, the G status acts like a lock on the goroutine's stack (and hence its ability to execute user code).
Calling Dial here is scary -- we have to be sure not to dial a name that will require a DNS lookup, or Dial will call back here to translate it.
CharsetReader, if non-nil, defines a function to generate charset-conversion readers, converting from the provided non-UTF-8 charset into UTF-8.
December 29 to 31 are in week 1 of next year if they are after the last Thursday of the year and December 31 is a Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.
Ensure that this guarantee from the docs is upheld: "Further calls to Parse in the copy will add templates to the copy but not to the original."
From NetBSD's _lwp_unpark(2) manual: "If the target LWP is not currently waiting, it will return immediately upon the next call to _lwp_park()."
Generate many test cases, compute correct answer using shift and subtract, and then compare against results from division and modulus operators.
In general RFC1123Z should be used instead of RFC1123 for servers that insist on that format, and RFC3339 should be preferred for new protocols.
It's a good but not certain bet that FileInfo will tell us exactly how much to read, so let's try it but be prepared for the answer to be wrong.
NOTE: This flag is the first flag to enable if importing dies because of (suspected) format errors, and whenever a change is made to the format.
On 32-bit systems, the max alignment is 32-bit, and the overflow pointer will add another 32-bit field, and the struct will end with no padding.
On 64-bit systems, the max alignment is 64-bit, and the overflow pointer will add another 64-bit field, and the struct will end with no padding.
On ppc64, when compiling Go into position independent code on ppc64le we insert an instruction to reload the TOC pointer from the stack as well.
One such possible incorrect interpretation is to treat two arbitrary memory words (Inner.P1 and Inner.P2 below) as an interface (Outer.R below).
OpenBSD option: http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man5/resolv.conf.5 "the legal space-separated values are: bind, file, yp"
Returning bufio.ErrFinalToken here tells Scan there are no more tokens after this but does not trigger an error to be returned from Scan itself.
Since CancelRequest will clear the canceler, we can use the return value to detect if the request was canceled since the last setReqCancel call.
TODO(mwhudson): it would obviously be better to change the register allocation to put the value in R12 already, but I don't know how to do that.
TestBlank checks that Sprint (and hence Print, Fprint) puts spaces in the right places, that is, between arg pairs in which neither is a string.
The client calls WriteRequest to write a request to the connection and calls ReadResponseHeader and ReadResponseBody in pairs to read responses.
The comment was prepared by DocReader, so it is known not to have leading, trailing blank lines nor to have trailing spaces at the end of lines.
The compiler cannot see that cgoAlwaysFalse is always false, so it emits the test and keeps the call, giving the desired escape analysis result.
The hope is that although the code will be slightly longer, the MOVs will have no dependencies and pipeline better than the unrolled STOSL loop.
The hope is that although the code will be slightly longer, the MOVs will have no dependencies and pipeline better than the unrolled STOSQ loop.
The next arena is populated as the spans request memory to hold gcmarkBits for the next GC cycle as well as allocBits for newly allocated spans.
The special form /* ERROR HERE "rx" */ must be used for error messages that appear immediately after a token, rather than at a token's position.
The value here is the IPv6 minimum MTU (1280 bytes) minus the overhead of an IPv6 header (40 bytes) and a TCP header with timestamps (32 bytes).
This disclaimer of warranty extends to the user of these programs and user's customers, employees, agents, transferees, successors, and assigns.
This ensures that each transition is performed by exactly one thread and threads that need the transition to happen block until it has happened.
This file encapsulates some of the odd characteristics of the ARM64 instruction set, to minimize its interaction with the core of the assembler.
This file encapsulates some of the odd characteristics of the s390x instruction set, to minimize its interaction with the core of the assembler.
This is O(N*M), if this ever shows up as a bottleneck, evaluate sorting the mappings and doing a binary search, which would make it O(N*log(M)).
Together with the remainder, we can decide whether the result is exact, bigger than 1/2ulp, or less than 1/2ulp (it will never equal to 1/2ulp).
Verify the status quo: that the Client.Post function coerces its body into a ReadCloser if it's a Closer, and that the Transport then closes it.
Wait for background goroutines to finish, so that exit handler that removes the work directory is not fighting with active writes or open files.
We allow extra bytes at the end of the SEQUENCE because adding elements to the end has been used in X.509 as the version numbers have increased.
We can still do those computations and then adjust the result for a negative numerator, but it's annoying to write the adjustment over and over.
We only care about global data: NAME_EXTERN means a global symbol in the Go sense, and p.Sym.Local is true for a few internally defined symbols.
We want to detect all cases where a program that does not use unsafe makes a cgo call passing a Go pointer to memory that contains a Go pointer.
When introducing new tests, please try to make them two-way as well to ensure that marshalling and unmarshalling are as symmetrical as feasible.
a "correcting" unindent immediately following a line break is applied before the line break if there is no comment between (see writeWhitespace)
appendNewName appends f, as encoded in one of "Literal Header field - New Name" representation variants, to dst and returns the extended buffer.
attr identifies the current HTML attribute when inside the attribute, that is, starting from stateAttrName until stateTag/stateText (exclusive).
byName sorts field by name, breaking ties with depth, then breaking ties with "name came from json tag", then breaking ties with index sequence.
don't print parentheses around an already parenthesized expression TODO(gri) consider making this more general and incorporate precedence levels
emit an initializer for n:1 initializations only once (not for each node on the lhs which may appear in different order in the dependency graph)
errNeedMore is an internal sentinel error value that means the buffer is truncated and we need to read more data before we can continue parsing.
expectedErrors collects the regular expressions of ERROR comments found in files and returns them as a map of error positions to error messages.
for go:linkname Supply environ and __progname, because we don't link against the standard NetBSD crt0.o and the libc dynamic library needs them.
genManyPred creates an array of blocks where 1/3rd have a successor of the first block, 1/3rd the last block, and the remaining third are plain.
gp and deadline are logically local variables, but they are written as parameters so that the stack space they require is charged to the caller.
hasBreak reports if s is or contains a break statement referring to the label-ed statement or implicit-ly the closest outer breakable statement.
if the variable has a type (ntype) then typechecking will not look at defn, so it is okay (and desirable, so that the conversion below happens).
innermost header reachable from this block IF any successor s of b is in a loop headed by h AND h dominates b THEN b is in the loop headed by h.
recordIfExit checks sl (the loop containing b) to see if it is outside of loop l, and if so, records b as an exit block from l and returns true.
scan is like Parse but reads the longest possible prefix representing a valid floating point number from an io.ByteScanner rather than a string.
since the blocks are assorted in ascending order by entry number once we know that we don't dominate a block we can't dominate any 'later' block
A pointer to a SID structure representing a group that will become the primary group of any objects created by a process using this access token.
An error is returned if targpath can't be made relative to basepath or if knowing the current working directory would be necessary to compute it.
Anonymous functions are considered part of the init expression/func declaration which contains them: use existing package-level declaration info.
Any .h, .hh, .hpp, or .hxx files will not be compiled separately, but, if these header files are changed, the C and C++ files will be recompiled.
As a special case, if Chan is a zero Value, then the case is ignored, and the field Send will also be ignored and may be either zero or non-zero.
As long as the Buffer has at least MinRead bytes beyond what is required to hold the contents of r, ReadFrom will not grow the underlying buffer.
But it won't reuse temporaries as aggressively as it might, and it can result in unnecessary zeroing of those variables in the function prologue.
CTLs are used to create the new chain beginning with the self-signed certificate from the original chain as the end certificate of the new chain.
Checkmarking To help debug the concurrent GC we remark with the world stopped ensuring that any object encountered has their normal mark bit set.
Disable registerization for globals, because: (1) we might panic at any time and we want the recovery code to see the latest values (issue 1304).
DrawMask aligns r.Min in dst with sp in src and mp in mask and then replaces the rectangle r in dst with the result of a Porter-Duff composition.
ERROR "generated nil check" This one should be removed but the block copy needs to be turned into its own pseudo-op in order to see the indirect.
EncryptPEMBlock returns a PEM block of the specified type holding the given DER-encoded data encrypted with the specified algorithm and password.
Export data encoding: The export data is a serialized description of the graph of exported "objects": constants, types, variables, and functions.
First template becomes return value if not already defined, and we use that one for subsequent New calls to associate all the templates together.
For HTTP/2, StateActive fires on the transition from zero to one active request, and only transitions away once all active requests are complete.
For compound operands such as slices and structs, the format applies to the elements of each operand, recursively, not to the operand as a whole.
For variables assigned to a variable in an outer scope or used as a return value, they store a flow(theSink, src) edge to a fake node 'the Sink'.
Functions of the form func BenchmarkXxx(*testing.B) are considered benchmarks, and are executed by go test when the -test.bench flag is provided.
I am scared that if we don't include the +2 here, the kernel will silently write 2 words farther than we specify and we'll get memory corruption.
If a Conn does not implement Queryer, the sql package's DB.Query will first prepare a query, execute the statement, and then close the statement.
If non-nil, the Values function generates a slice of arbitrary reflect.Values that are congruent with the arguments to the function being tested.
If the non-Go code called by the Go program does not change any signal handlers or masks, then the behavior is the same as for a pure Go program.
If the server requested a certificate then we have to send a Certificate message, even if it's empty because we don't have a certificate to send.
If the zone abbreviation is unknown, Parse records the time as being in a fabricated location with the given zone abbreviation and a zero offset.
Indicates that the dynamic linker should process all relocations for the object containing this entry before transferring control to the program.
IsS390xWithIndex reports whether the op (as defined by an s390x.A* constant) refers to an instruction which takes an index as its first argument.
Issue 7316 This test exercises all types of numeric conversions, which was one of the sources of etype mismatch during register allocation in 8g.
It sets z to the (possibly rounded) value of the corresponding floating- point value, and returns z, the actual base b, and an error err, if any.
NOTE(rsc): On Windows, it is critically important that the gcc-compiled objects (cgoObjects) be listed after the ordinary objects in the archive.
NOTE: KAME based IPv6 protocol stack usually embeds the interface index in the interface-local or link-local address as the kernel-internal form.
Note that go generate does not parse the file, so lines that look like directives in comments or multiline strings will be treated as directives.
Note: although address of runtime.edata (type SDATA) is at the start of .bss section it still belongs to the .data section, not the .bss section.
One of the copies, say from b to r2, could be avoided by using a more elaborate trick where the other copy is made during Request/Response.Write.
Optimization: rather than push and pop, code that is going to Push and continue the loop simply updates ip, p, and arg and jumps to CheckAndLoop.
PreferServerCipherSuites controls whether the server selects the client's most preferred ciphersuite, or the server's most preferred ciphersuite.
RFC 2616: Must treat GET /index.html HTTP/1.1 Host: www.google.com and GET http://www.google.com/index.html HTTP/1.1 Host: doesntmatter the same.
Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met: 1.
Reflect uses the "interface" calling convention for methods, where receivers take one word of argument space no matter how big they actually are.
TODO(gri) For nested breakable statements, the current implementation of hasBreak will traverse the same subtree repeatedly, once for each label.
TODO:  If we have a nonempty interface and its itab field is nil, then this test is redundant and ifaceType should just branch directly to bFail.
The escape analysis can be more precise when analyzing a single non-recursive function than when analyzing a set of mutually recursive functions.
The last form is not permitted for boolean flags because the meaning of the command cmd -x * will change if there is a file called 0, false, etc.
The protocol is such that each side only has a block or two on its free list at a time, so there's no need to worry about trimming the list, etc.
The testfile must not contain multi-line raw strings since those are not indented (because their values must not change) and make this test fail.
They aren't necessary in the pure Go implementation, as we don't use those same optimizations, but using the same thresholds doesn't really hurt.
This is used during stack unwinding for panic/recover and by heapBitsBulkBarrier to force stack re-scanning when its destination is on the stack.
This looks for code that uses cgo to call C code passing values whose types are almost always invalid according to the cgo pointer sharing rules.
This preserves all relevant overflow buckets alive even if the table grows and/or overflow buckets are added to the table while we are iterating.
This will cause oplook to return a variant of the instruction that loads the negative constant from memory, rather than using the immediate form.
We may want to revisit this, since the EscStep nodes would make an excellent replacement for the poorly-separated graph-build/graph-flood stages.
When a more abstract interface isn't necessary, there are functions for encrypting/decrypting with v1.5/OAEP and signing/verifying with v1.5/PSS.
cbcDecAble is implemented by cipher.Blocks that can provide an optimized implementation of CBC decryption through the cipher.BlockMode interface.
cbcEncAble is implemented by cipher.Blocks that can provide an optimized implementation of CBC encryption through the cipher.BlockMode interface.
decorate prefixes the string with the file and line of the call site and inserts the final newline if needed and indentation tabs for formatting.
errMissingFF00 means that readByteStuffedByte encountered an 0xff byte (a marker byte) that wasn't the expected byte-stuffed sequence 0xff, 0x00.
for go:linkname Supply environ and __progname, because we don't link against the standard FreeBSD crt0.o and the libc dynamic library needs them.
scanInts performs the same scanning task as RecursiveInt.Scan but without recurring through scanner, so we can compare performance more directly.
src is a bidirectional channel value, dst is a channel type, src and dst have identical element types, and either src or dst is not a named type.
subsequent noteclear must be called only after previous notesleep has returned, e.g. it's disallowed to call noteclear straight after notewakeup.
suiteECDSA indicates that the cipher suite involves an ECDSA signature and therefore may only be selected when the server's certificate is ECDSA.
tls.Config.ServerName (non-empty, set to "example.com") takes precedence over "some-other-host.tld" which previously incorrectly took precedence.
variable assignments in the current block (map from variable symbol to ssa value) Node is the unique identifier (an ONAME Node) for the variable.
when the first reference to the literal pool threatens to go out of range of a 12-bit PC-relative offset, drop the pool now, and branch round it.
where func is the function, val is the current value, p is the instruction being considered, and arg can be used to further parameterize valfunc.
with all the branches out of the way, it is now time to transmogrify this node itself unless inhibited by the switch at the top of this function.
(If msg is empty, a suitable default message will be sent.) After such a timeout, writes by h to its ResponseWriter will return ErrHandlerTimeout.
(In multiple calls to Parse with the same receiver template, only one call can contain text other than space, comments, and template definitions.)
A bucket is at most bucketSize*(1+maxKeySize+maxValSize)+2*ptrSize bytes, or 2072 bytes, or 259 pointer-size words, or 33 bytes of pointer bitmap.
AppendQuoteToASCII appends a double-quoted Go string literal representing s, as generated by QuoteToASCII, to dst and returns the extended buffer.
Applying them to UTC times will use "UTC" as the time zone abbreviation, while strictly speaking those RFCs require the use of "GMT" in that case.
As an implementation detail we allow to set finalizers for an inner byte of an object if it could come from tiny alloc (see mallocgc for details).
ClientCAs defines the set of root certificate authorities that servers use if required to verify a client certificate by the policy in ClientAuth.
CompilePOSIX is like Compile but restricts the regular expression to POSIX ERE (egrep) syntax and changes the match semantics to leftmost-longest.
Conversely, if there exists an initialization cycle involving a variable in the program, the tree walk will reach a cycle involving that variable.
DialWithDialer connects to the given network address using dialer.Dial and then initiates a TLS handshake, returning the resulting TLS connection.
Don't save err from unmarshal into dec.err: the connection is still usable since we read a complete JSON object from it before the error happened.
First, we make everything "old": but only a few seconds old, or it might be older than gc (or the runtime source) and everything will get rebuilt.
For instance, to configure a Scanner such that it only recognizes (Go) identifiers, integers, and skips comments, set the Scanner's Mode field to:
For tests the regular expression is split into smaller ones by top-level '/', where each must match the corresponding part of a test's identifier.
However, after performing the horizontal 1-D IDCT, there are typically non-zero AC components, so we do not bother to check for the all-zero case.
If the package is a command (package main), the exported symbols of the package are elided from the presentation unless the -cmd flag is provided.
If, later, Reset is called for that signal, the original handling for that signal will be reinstalled, restoring the non-Go signal handler if any.
IsS390xWithLength reports whether the op (as defined by an s390x.A* constant) refers to an instruction which takes a length as its first argument.
It is important that the parser distinguishes logically inconsistent traces (e.g. missing, excessive or misordered events) from broken timestamps.
Loop until the P dies and disassociates this worker (the P may later be reused, in which case it will get a new worker) or we failed to associate.
Mach-O header data structures http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/MachORuntime/Reference/reference.html
Nodes n0, n1 and n4 (marked with a trailing "-") are partial keys, and nodes n2, n3, n5, n6 and n7 (marked with a trailing "+") are complete keys.
Note that terminating "vendor" elements don't count: "x/vendor" is its own package, not the vendored copy of an import "" (the empty import path).
OPACK nodes are never valid in const value declarations, but allow them like any other declared symbol to avoid crashing (golang.org/issue/11361).
ParseGlob creates a new Template and parses the template definitions from the files identified by the pattern, which must match at least one file.
ParseNetlinkRouteAttr parses m's payload as an array of netlink route attributes and returns the slice containing the NetlinkRouteAttr structures.
Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:  1.
Some HTTP clients will get the response and some (like ours, currently) will complain that the request write failed, without reading the response.
Special cases that have turned out to be useful: ssa/check/on enables checking after each phase ssa/all/time enables time reporting for all phases
TODO(gri) Along the same lines, enforce some limit to shift magnitudes to avoid "infinitely" long running conversions (until we run out of space).
The VARDEF must appear before the actual (multi-instruction) initialization, and it must also appear after any uses of the previous value, if any.
The arguments to the directive are space-separated tokens or double-quoted strings passed to the generator as individual arguments when it is run.
The following complex 3-stage scheme of stats accumulation is required to obtain a consistent picture of mallocs and frees for some point in time.
The only signal values guaranteed to be present on all systems are Interrupt (send the process an interrupt) and Kill (force the process to exit).
The order matters: we must return the index of the final element, because the final one produces the most restrictive requirement on the importer.
The original input can be supplied, and if the huffman encoded data is larger than the original bytes, the data will be written as a stored block.
The parent package is needed for exported struct fields and interface methods which don't contain explicit package information in the export data.
The test files have a gAMA chunk but the go PNG parser ignores it (the PNG spec section 11.3 says "Ancillary chunks may be ignored by a decoder").
The type and value of the flag are represented by the first argument, of type Value, which typically holds a user-defined implementation of Value.
There are ten standard frame types, but extension frame types may be written by WriteRawFrame and will be returned by ReadFrame (as UnknownFrame).
This code cannot do that, because the io.Writer might block or need system calls or locks that are not safe to use from within the signal handler.
This could lead to a non-deterministic behavior, where connection requests over the port cannot be guaranteed to be handled by the correct socket.
This message is a digest of all preceding handshake-layer messages that is signed using the private key corresponding to the client's certificate.
This test checks if the compiler's internal constant arithmetic correctly rounds up floating-point values that become the smallest denormal value.
To avoid allocating while building that equivalence class, move the values equivalent to v to the beginning of e and other values to the end of e.
To choose the cutoff, look at the whole expression but excluding primary expressions (function calls, parenthesized exprs), and apply these rules:
Various implementations of ValueConverter are provided by the driver package to provide consistent implementations of conversions between drivers.
We only check instances where the defer or go statement is the last statement in the loop body, as otherwise we would need whole program analysis.
We provide a socket that listens to a wildcard address with reusable UDP port when the given laddr is an appropriate UDP multicast address prefix.
When passing a pointer to an element in an array or slice, the Go memory in question is the entire array or the entire backing array of the slice.
Write barriers are disallowed because this is used by gcDrain after it has ensured that all work is drained and this must preserve that condition.
Zone computes the time zone in effect at time t, returning the abbreviated name of the zone (such as "CET") and its offset in seconds east of UTC.
convert string Algorithm: Collect digits in groups of at most n digits in di and then use mulAddWW for every such group to add them to the result.
deductSweepCredit makes a worst-case assumption that all spanBytes bytes of the ultimately allocated span will be available for object allocation.
fdMutex is a specialized synchronization primitive that manages lifetime of an fd and serializes access to Read, Write and Close methods on netFD.
golang.org/issue/8534 -- the Server shouldn't reuse a connection for keep-alive after it's seen any Write error (e.g. a timeout) on that net.Conn.
protocols contains minimal mappings between internet protocol names and numbers for platforms that don't have a complete list of protocol numbers.
redirect .../index.html to .../ can't use Redirect() because that would make the path absolute, which would be a problem running under StripPrefix
spec: "For a variable x of struct type: unsafe.Alignof(x) is the largest of the values unsafe.Alignof(x.f) for each field f of x, but at least 1."
stopTheWorld stops all P's from executing goroutines, interrupting all goroutines at GC safe points and records reason as the reason for the stop.
"if the second iteration variable is the blank identifier, the range clause is equivalent to the same clause with only the first variable present."
(this code is not valid Go because the first t cannot be accessed and thus is never used, the extra scope is needed for the correct error message).
A Reader implements the io.Reader, io.ReaderAt, io.WriterTo, io.Seeker, io.ByteScanner, and io.RuneScanner interfaces by reading from a byte slice.
A variable is considered shadowed (if *strictShadowing is off) only if the shadowing variable is declared within the span of the shadowed variable.
After the LZW decoder completes, there will be a 0-byte block remaining (0, ()), which is consumed when checking that the blockReader is exhausted.
All the strings have the same prefix, so ignore it for map purposes, but use a slice of the symbol name string to reduce long-term memory overhead.
An encoding is invalid if it is incorrect UTF-8, encodes a rune that is out of range, or is not the shortest possible UTF-8 encoding for the value.
Any common use of the -a flag should be considered prima facie evidence that isStale is returning an incorrect false result in some important case.
As this time is unlikely to come up in practice, the IsZero method gives a simple way of detecting a time that has not been initialized explicitly.
Autos after anything else, within autos, unused after used, within used, things with pointers first, zeroed things first, and then decreasing size.
Before looping back to the top of this function and peeking on the bufio.Reader, wait for the caller goroutine to finish reading the response body.
Compute upper and lower such that any decimal number between upper and lower (possibly inclusive) will round to the original floating point number.
Each Cond has an associated Locker L (often a *Mutex or *RWMutex), which must be held when changing the condition and when calling the Wait method.
EpilogueBegin indicates that Address is one (of possibly many) PCs where execution should be suspended for a breakpoint on exit from this function.
Get the cached or newly-created connection to either the host (for http or https), the http proxy, or the http proxy pre-CONNECTed to https server.
If a package 'explicit' imports a package 'implicit', building 'explicit' into a shared library implicitly includes implicit in the shared library.
If it resolves, it a) has correctly resolved, or b) incorrectly resolved because the key is a struct field with a name matching another identifier.
If sync is true, this is a self-triggered stack growth and, in particular, no other G may be writing to gp's stack (e.g., via a channel operation).
If the GC is running, we can't return a stack span to the heap because it could be reused as a heap span, and this state change would race with GC.
If typ describes a variadic function, the final Value is itself a slice representing the variadic arguments, as in the body of a variadic function.
If we do it the other way around, it is possible that exitsyscall will query sysexitticks after ticksStart but before traceEvGoInSyscall timestamp.
If we're giving the compiler the entire package (no C etc files), tell it that, so that it can give good error messages about forward declarations.
In two's complement representation, the negative number of any number (except the smallest one) can be computed by flipping all the bits and add 1.
Instead, reconstructBlock is called on each accumulated block by the reconstructProgressiveImage method after all of the SOS markers are processed.
Issue 6995 A server Handler can receive a Request, and then turn around and give a copy of that Request.Body out to the Transport (e.g. any proxy).
It's a wrapper around rwc that provides io.LimitedReader-style limiting (while reading request headers) and functionality to support CloseNotifier.
Map: Key, Elem Ptr: Elem Slice: Elem Struct: Field, FieldByIndex, FieldByName, FieldByNameFunc, NumField Bits returns the size of the type in bits.
NOTE: Usage is not just defaultUsage(CommandLine) because it serves (via godoc flag Usage) as the example for how to write your own usage function.
NOTE: packing all the keys together and then all the values together makes the code a bit more complicated than alternating key/value/key/value/...
Note that sometimes we use a lowercase //sys name and wrap it in our own nicer implementation, either here or in syscall_bsd.go or syscall_unix.go.
On systems without link registers, the architecture pushes a return PC during the call instruction, so the return PC ends up above the stack frame.
On the other hand, for a correct parse there must be a time zone at the beginning of the string, so it's almost always true that there's one there.
Otherwise, if the source file says type T C.whatever, use "T" as the mangling of C.whatever, except in the definition (handled at end of function).
Otherwise, receive from head of queue and add sender's value to the tail of the queue (both map to the same buffer slot because the queue is full).
Performing multiple connect system calls on a non-blocking socket under Unix variants does not necessarily result in earlier errors being returned.
R_ADDRMIPSTLS (only used on mips64) resolves to the low 16 bits of a TLS address (offset from thread pointer), by encoding it into the instruction.
Reset discards the writer's state and makes it equivalent to the result of NewWriter or NewWriterDict called with dst and w's level and dictionary.
ShortestDecimal stores in d the shortest decimal representation of f which belongs to the open interval (lower, upper), where f is supposed to lie.
Some parameter list entries have both a name and a type: Distribute types backwards and check that there are no mixed named and unnamed parameters.
TODO(crawshaw): as these structTypeFixedN and funcTypeFixedN structs have no methods, they could be defined at runtime using the StructOf function.
TestCipherSuiteCertPreferance ensures that we select an RSA ciphersuite with an RSA certificate and an ECDSA ciphersuite with an ECDSA certificate.
The Server.ConnState hook for StateActive fires before the request has entered a handler and doesn't fire again until the request has been handled.
The exporter and importer are completely symmetric in implementation: For each encoding routine there is a matching and symmetric decoding routine.
The first argument must be the result of an evaluation that yields a value of function type (as distinct from a predefined function such as print).
The given regular expression is split into smaller ones by top-level '/', where each must match the corresponding part of a benchmark's identifier.
The main expense here is the call to signalstack to release the m's signal stack, and then the call to needm on the next callback from this thread.
The opposite can also happen: if we ask the kernel to pick an appropriate originating local address, sometimes it picks one that is already in use.
The same algorithm applies in both cases, but the method tables for an interface type and a concrete type are different, so the code is duplicated.
This directive typically appears in machine-generated code, so that compilers and debuggers will show lines in the original input to the generator.
This file implements the Bits type used for testing Float operations via an independent (albeit slower) representations for floating-point numbers.
This is necessary because the regular memory allocator can itself grow the stack, and hence can't be used when allocating stack-related structures.
This procedure is complicated by various sources of implicit control flow that are not accounted for using the standard cfg construction algorithm.
To shake out latent assumptions about scheduling order, we introduce some randomness into scheduling decisions when running with the race detector.
ToLowerSpecial returns a copy of the byte slice s with all Unicode letters mapped to their lower case, giving priority to the special casing rules.
ToTitleSpecial returns a copy of the byte slice s with all Unicode letters mapped to their title case, giving priority to the special casing rules.
ToUpperSpecial returns a copy of the byte slice s with all Unicode letters mapped to their upper case, giving priority to the special casing rules.
We could make things marginally faster by splitting the 32-bit case out into a separate block but it's not worth the duplication, so u has 64 bits.
We're done with this pconn and somebody else is currently waiting for a conn of this type (they're actively dialing, but this conn is ready first).
assignment reports whether x can be assigned to a variable of type T, if necessary by attempting to convert untyped values to the appropriate type.
disableBuildID adjusts a linker command line to avoid creating a build ID when creating an object file rather than an executable or shared library.
for go:linkname Supply environ and __progname, because we don't link against the standard DragonFly crt0.o and the libc dynamic library needs them.
format formats the given package file originally obtained from src and adjusts the result based on the original source via sourceAdj and indentAdj.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms This program demonstrates that Go's automatic stack management can handle heavily recursive computations.
if a goroutine uses notetsleep to wake up early, it must wait to call noteclear until it can be sure that no other goroutine is calling notewakeup.
l is an lv and rt is the type of an rv return 1 if this implies a function call evaluating the lv or a function call in the conversion of the types
quantErrorCurr and quantErrorNext are the Floyd-Steinberg quantization errors that have been propagated to the pixels in the current and next rows.
regular types are passed by reference to avoid C vararg calls orderexpr arranged for n.Left to be a temporary for all the conversions it could see.
trimUnexportedElems modifies spec in place to elide unexported fields from structs and methods from interfaces (unless the unexported flag is set).
with more work we could leave cross-function code references to be relocated too, and then perhaps we'd be able to parallelize the span loop above.
xgetwd might return a path with symlinks fully resolved, and if there happens to be symlinks in goroot, then the hasprefix test will never succeed.
*ast.ImportSpec    *PkgName for dot-imports and imports without renames ast.CaseClause    type-specific *Var for each type switch case clause (incl.
4 bytes: length, must be multiple of thearch.ptrsize 4 bytes: Pointer to the CIE above, at offset 0 ptrsize: initial location ptrsize: address range
A nil value is valid and may be useful for testing but it is not secure: it means that the HTTP server for foo.co.uk can set a cookie for bar.co.uk.
An untyped nil does not need a pointer check, and when _cgoCheckPointer returns the untyped nil the type assertion we are going to insert will fail.
Any frames above this have not executed since the concurrent scan of gp and any writes through up-pointers to above this barrier had write barriers.
Build IDs have made that workaround unnecessary: "go install ./..." will rebuild any objects it finds that were built against a different toolchain.
But for the more general problem of syntactically identifying dead code, continue redirects control flow just like the other terminating statements.
CanBackquote reports whether the string s can be represented unchanged as a single-line backquoted string without control characters other than tab.
Canceling this context releases resources associated with it, so code should call cancel as soon as the operations running in this Context complete.
Canceling this context releases resources associated with it, so code should call cancel as soon as the operations running in this Context complete:
Check presence of 2nd and 3rd index here rather than during type-checking to prevent erroneous programs from passing through gofmt (was issue 7305).
Cleantempnopop emits to *out VARKILL instructions for each temporary above the mark on the temporary stack, but it does not pop them from the stack.
CloseIdleConnections closes any connections which were previously connected from previous requests but are now sitting idle in a "keep-alive" state.
CloseNotify is undefined after a hijack, but we have no place to return an error, so just return a channel, even though it'll never receive a value.
Each value maps to a uint32 of which the 8 most significant bits hold the codeword size in bits and the 24 least significant bits hold the codeword.
Either way, TestStop should still be able to catch them when it wants them and then when it stops wanting them, the original behavior should resume.
Figures B.2 and B.16 of the specification suggest that restart markers should only occur between Entropy Coded Segments and not after the final ECS.
For example, relations learned for unsigned pairs cannot be transferred to signed pairs because the same bit representation can mean something else.
For hexadecimal mantissae, the exponent must be binary, if present (an "e" or "E" exponent indicator cannot be distinguished from a mantissa digit).
For instance, given flag.String("I", "", "search `directory` for include files") the output will be -I directory search directory for include files.
For some reason, WriteString returns an error: "write /net/tcp/39/listen: inappropriate use of fd" But without it, Reads on dead conns hang forever.
However, because the mantissa is only 63 bits, we don't need the LSB, so instead we do an unsigned right shift (divide by two), convert, and double.
If a variable's address is taken, that disables registerization for the individual words of the variable (for example, the base,len,cap of a slice).
If allowPax is false, we are being called by writePAXHeader, and hdrBuff is already being used by the non-recursive call, so we must use paxHdrBuff.
If returnPos is valid, initVars is called to type-check the assignment of return expressions, and returnPos is the position of the return statement.
If the EOF occurs unexpectedly in a structured data stream, the appropriate error is either ErrUnexpectedEOF or some other error giving more detail.
If the matched suffix does not occur elsewhere in pattern, then the matching frame may share part of its prefix with the end of the matching suffix.
If the provided file or directory name is a relative path, it is interpreted relative to the current directory and may ascend to parent directories.
If there is no match, the return value is an empty string, but it will also be empty if the regular expression successfully matches an empty string.
If there's not a data descriptor, we still compare the CRC32 of what we've read against the file header or TOC's CRC32, if it seems like it was set.
If you pass in more bytes than the file contains, it will loop back to the beginning ad nauseam until it's sent exactly the number of bytes told to.
In essence, the _cgo_import.o file includes the extra linking directives that cmd/link is not sophisticated enough to derive from _all.o on its own.
In this way, import comments let package authors make sure the custom import path is used and not a direct path to the underlying code hosting site.
It is equivalent to defaultlit except for constants of numerical kind, which are acceptable whenever they can be represented by a value of type int.
It must retrieve the original return PC from g.stkbuf, increment g.stkbufPos to record that the barrier was hit, and jump to the original return PC.
It should be executed only by the sender, never the receiver, and has the effect of shutting down the channel after the last sent value is received.
Modification times are attractive because the logic is easy to understand and the file system maintains the mtimes automatically (less work for us).
Now that copyprop is done, remov MOVLQZX R1, R2 if it is dominated by an earlier ADDL/MOVL/etc into R1 that will have already cleared the high bits.
Otherwise, the export data starts with the negative string length (negative, so we can distinguish from string index), followed by the string bytes.
PrintDefaults prints, to standard error unless configured otherwise, a usage message showing the default settings of all defined command-line flags.
Put the idle conn back into the pool before we send the response so if they process it quickly and make another request, they'll get this same conn.
Rather than require memory barriers, which will slow down both the mutator and the GC, we always grey the ptr object regardless of the slot's color.
RawToken is like Token but does not verify that start and end elements match and does not translate name space prefixes to their corresponding URLs.
SetBoundary must be called before any parts are created, may only contain certain ASCII characters, and must be non-empty and at most 69 bytes long.
Specifically, slice needs a consistent ptr and cap, string needs a consistent ptr and len, and interface needs a consistent type word and data word.
Strings are canonicalized similar to objects that may occur multiple times: If the string was exported already, it is represented by its index only.
TODO(mdempsky): Replace this with a struct-valued switch statement once golang.org/issue/15164 is fixed or found to not impair cmd/link performance.
Test files that declare a package with the suffix "_test" will be compiled as a separate package, and then linked and run with the main test binary.
The current approach: We unpark an additional thread when we ready a goroutine if (1) there is an idle P and there are no "spinning" worker threads.
The original implementation was buggy in that in some data dependent cases it would overwrite stderr in the child with one of the ExtraFile members.
The overall structure of Import is symmetric to Export: For each export method in bexport.go there is a matching and symmetric method in bimport.go.
The remainder of the byte array (also not including the new line bytes) is also returned and this will always be smaller than the original argument.
The size of an entry is the sum of its name's length in octets (as defined in Section 5.2), its value's length in octets (see Section 5.2), plus 32.
The symbols are uint16s because bzip2 encodes not only MTF indexes in the tree, but also two magic values for run-length encoding and an EOF symbol.
The trampoline records that the stack has unwound past this frame and jumps to the original return PC recorded when the stack barrier was installed.
The zero (uninitialized) value for a Float is ready to use and represents the number +0.0 exactly, with precision 0 and rounding mode ToNearestEven.
There is also the problem of a crash happening during the print routines and needing to acquire the print lock to print information about the crash.
This example illustrates how to remove a variable declaration in a Go program while maintaining correct comment association using an ast.CommentMap.
This is the opposite of what the previous problem would have us do, but binary distributions are more common than instances of the previous problem.
Thus, if the set of possible messages is small, an attacker may be able to build a map from messages to signatures and identify the signed messages.
To accomplish that, we iteratively perform depth-first searches of increasing depth until we either find the named field/method or exhaust the tree.
Untyped expressions may eventually become fully typed (i.e., not untyped), typically when the value is assigned to a variable, or is used otherwise.
We cannot just call the runtime routines, because the race detector expects to be able to intercept the sync/atomic forms but not the runtime forms.
adjustSourcePath adjusts the path for a source file by trimming known prefixes and searching for the file on all parents of the current working dir.
cert.pem and key.pem were generated with generate_cert.go Thus, they have no ExtKeyUsage fields and trigger an error when verification is turned on.
checkAtomicAddAssignment walks the atomic.Add* method calls checking for assigning the return value to the same variable being used in the operation
dotpath computes the unique shortest explicit selector path to fully qualify a selection expression x.f, where x is of type t and f is the symbol s.
generate all uint64 values x, y where x has at most n1 bits set in the low w1 and y has at most n2 bits set in the low w2 and call f(x, y) for each.
htmlReplacer returns s with runes replaced according to replacementTable and when badRunes is true, certain bad runes are allowed through unescaped.
lhs of a short variable declaration but doesn't enter scope until later: caller must call p.shortVarDecl(p.makeIdentList(list)) at appropriate time.
spec: "An embedded type must be specified as a type name T or as a pointer to a non-interface type name *T, and T itself may not be a pointer type."
spec: "If there is a label, it must be that of an enclosing "for", "switch", or "select" statement, and that is the one whose execution terminates."
stripOutputComment finds and removes the "Output:" or "Unordered output:" comment from body and comments, and adjusts the body block's end position.
All m's that have already received SIGQUIT have signal masks blocking receipt of any signals, so the SIGQUIT will go to an m that hasn't seen it yet.
All other slices and arrays are sent as an unsigned count followed by that many elements using the standard gob encoding for their type, recursively.
Construct it by chopping the same number of path elements (actually the same number of bytes) from parent's import path and then append /vendor/path.
Decide whether the given rune is in the XML Character Range, per the Char production of http://www.xml.com/axml/testaxml.htm, Section 2.2 Characters.
Description of testing flags The 'go test' command takes both flags that apply to 'go test' itself and flags that apply to the resulting test binary.
Dijkstra pointed out that maintaining the no black to white pointers means that white to white pointers do not need to be noted by the write barrier.
Encode instructions and create relocation for accessing s+d according to the instruction op with source or destination (as appropriate) register reg.
Encode transmits the data item represented by the empty interface value, guaranteeing that all necessary type information has been transmitted first.
EncodeValue transmits the data item represented by the reflection value, guaranteeing that all necessary type information has been transmitted first.
Even before next_marker sees extraneous data, jpeg_fill_bit_buffer in jdhuff.c reads as many bytes as it can, possibly past the end of a scan's data.
FindExportData positions the reader r at the beginning of the export data section of an underlying GC-created object/archive file by reading from it.
For cgo, cb.arg points into a C stack frame and therefore doesn't hold any pointers that the GC can find anyway - the write barrier would be a no-op.
For client requests, certain headers such as Content-Length and Connection are automatically written when needed and values in Header may be ignored.
Functions in this package replace any occurrences of the slash ('/') character with os.PathSeparator when returning paths unless otherwise specified.
If a synchronous signal arrives while executing non-Go code, the Go runtime will invoke the existing signal handler instead of the Go signal handler.
If one needs to abstract over the public-key primitive, the PrivateKey struct implements the Decrypter and Signer interfaces from the crypto package.
If the Go signal handler is invoked on a non-Go thread not running Go code, the handler generally forwards the signal to the non-Go code, as follows.
If the distribution includes both inputs and cached build outputs, the conservative solution to the previous problem will cause unnecessary rebuilds.
If there's a difference and SourcePos is set in ConfigMode, //line comments are used in the output to restore original source positions for a reader.
ImportedLibraries returns the names of all libraries referred to by the binary f that are expected to be linked with the binary at dynamic link time.
ImportedLibraries returns the paths of all libraries referred to by the binary f that are expected to be linked with the binary at dynamic link time.
In one of the few places it is updated by Go code - func save - it must be treated as a uintptr to avoid a write barrier being emitted at a bad time.
In order to encrypt reasonable amounts of data a hybrid scheme is commonly used: RSA is used to encrypt a key for a symmetric primitive like AES-GCM.
IsStmt indicates that Address is a recommended breakpoint location, such as the beginning of a line, statement, or a distinct subpart of a statement.
It is valid both to add and to subtract offsets from a pointer in this way, but the result must continue to point into the original allocated object.
More generally, we could short-circuit from (1) to (3) even in chunking mode if the write size from (1) is over some threshold and nothing is in (2).
Note that it is not sufficient to simply compare file offsets because the offsets do not reflect modified line information (through //line comments).
Note, this optimization does not apply to OSLICEARR, because it does introduce a new pointer into b that was not already there (pointer to b itself).
Operations that manipulate stack barriers acquire this lock, while sigprof tries to acquire it and simply skips the traceback if it can't acquire it.
Otherwise, the Importer should load the package data for the given path into a new *Object (pkg), record pkg in the imports map, and then return pkg.
Package filepath implements utility routines for manipulating filename paths in a way compatible with the target operating system-defined file paths.
Package token defines constants representing the lexical tokens of the Go programming language and basic operations on tokens (printing, predicates).
Probably just a socket-late-binding dial from the default transport that lost the race (and thus this connection is now idle and will never be used).
RV_390_DBL is a s390x-specific relocation variant that indicates that the value to be placed into the relocatable field should first be divided by 2.
See also "In-Place Merging Algorithms", Denham Coates-Evely, Department of Computer Science, Kings College, January 2004 and the references in there.
TODO(gri) The functions operand.assignableTo, checker.convertUntyped, checker.representable, and checker.assignment are overlapping in functionality.
TODO(rsc): This is undone by the selective clearing of width below, to match architectures that were not as aggressive in setting width during naddr.
The Next method advances to the next file in the archive (including the first), and then it can be treated as an io.Reader to access the file's data.
The arguments are an initial substring of the remaining unprocessed data and a flag, atEOF, that reports whether the Reader has no more data to give.
The boolean value ok is true if the value x corresponds to a send on the channel, false if it is a zero value received because the channel is closed.
The main benefit of ServeContent over io.Copy is that it handles Range requests properly, sets the MIME type, and handles If-Modified-Since requests.
The string representation may use shortened package names (e.g., base64 instead of "encoding/base64") and is not guaranteed to be unique among types.
This ensures that we can install a Go release on a system that does not have a C compiler installed and still build Go programs (that don't use cgo).
This increases pause time, so we instead rely on write barriers for writes to globals so that we don't have to rescan global during mark termination.
This would lead to thread state thrashing, as the thread that readied the goroutine can be out of work the very next moment, we will need to park it.
To do this, the package must be distributed with a source file not excluded by build constraints and containing a "//go:binary-only-package" comment.
Traceback is safe if we're on the system stack (if necessary, flags will stop it before switching to the user stack), or if we locked the user stack.
Try to resolve the key but don't collect it as unresolved identifier if it fails so that we don't get (possibly false) errors about undeclared names.
Unless specified otherwise, operations permit aliasing of parameters, so it is perfectly ok to write sum.Add(sum, x) to accumulate values x in a sum.
Verify attempts to verify c by building one or more chains from c to a certificate in opts.Roots, using certificates in opts.Intermediates if needed.
Verify that sequential Decoders built on a single input will succeed if the input implements ReadByte and there is no type information in the stream.
When a goroutine needs to allocate a new small-object span, it sweeps small-object spans for the same object size until it frees at least one object.
When either cgo or SWIG is used, go build will pass any .c, .m, .s, or .S files to the C compiler, and any .cc, .cpp, .cxx files to the C++ compiler.
duff returns the offset (from duffzero, in bytes) and pointer adjust (in bytes) required to use the duffzero mechanism for a block of the given size.
funcOutput takes two file names as arguments, a coverage profile to read as input and an output file to write ("" means to write to standard output).
handled by ParseMultipartForm (which is calling us, or should be) TODO(bradfitz): there are too many possible orders to call too many functions here.
inverseBWT implements the inverse Burrows-Wheeler transform as described in http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/Compaq-DEC/SRC-RR-124.pdf, section 4.2.
loadDWARF parses the DWARF debug information generated by gcc to learn the details of the constants, variables, and types being referred to as C.xxx.
pcln does not make sense for Go object files, because each symbol has its own individual pcln table, so there is no global space of addresses to map.
skipSpecialPlatforms causes the test to be skipped for platforms where builders (build.golang.org) don't have access to compiled packages for import.
splitting doesn't necessarily remove the critical edge, since we're iterating over len(f.Blocks) above, this forces the new blocks to be re-examined.
(See the examples below.) However, if the argument starts with a capital letter it is assumed to identify a symbol or method in the current directory.
- Package "unsafe" contains special signatures requiring extra care when printing them - ignore since it is not going to change w/o a language change.
- new malloc spans can be created during the concurrent sweep Even if this is stop-the-world, a concurrent exitsyscall can allocate a stack from heap.
Accessing the header between logically writing it and physically writing it means we need to allocate a clone to snapshot the logically written state.
An ASN.1 SEQUENCE or SET can be written to a struct if each of the elements in the sequence can be written to the corresponding element in the struct.
AppendQuoteRune appends a single-quoted Go character literal representing the rune, as generated by QuoteRune, to dst and returns the extended buffer.
AppendQuoteToGraphic appends a double-quoted Go string literal representing s, as generated by QuoteToGraphic, to dst and returns the extended buffer.
Each test does only one real send or receive at a time, but phrased in various ways that the compiler may or may not rewrite into simpler expressions.
For Go 1.4 and beyond, we require this auto-tagging to apply only to files with a non-empty prefix, so "foo_linux.go" is tagged but "linux.go" is not.
For IP networks, the network must be "ip", "ip4" or "ip6" followed by a colon and a protocol number or name and the addr must be a literal IP address.
For backwards compatibility, a nil Disposal is valid to pass to EncodeAll, and implies that each frame's disposal method is 0 (no disposal specified).
GO_ARGS is inserted implicitly by the linker for any function that also has a Go prototype and therefore is usually not necessary to write explicitly.
If an error occurs during the execution of the statement, that error will be returned by a call to Scan on the returned *Row, which is always non-nil.
If we come past one that's uninitialized, this must be a (harmless) forward jump but if it's set to nonlooping the label must have preceded this goto.
If, later, Reset is called for that signal, or Stop is called on all channels passed to Notify for that signal, the signal will once again be blocked.
In order to make sure that there is always an m structure available to be stolen, we maintain the invariant that there is always one more than needed.
In other words, if a variable is shadowed but not used after the shadowed variable is declared, it is inconsequential and not worth complaining about.
In the returned data, continuation lines are separated from the previous line only by a single space: the newline and leading white space are removed.
IndexAny returns the index of the first instance of any Unicode code point from chars in s, or -1 if no Unicode code point from chars is present in s.
Insert moved spills (that have not been marked invalid above) at start of appropriate block and remove the originals from their location within loops.
It also implements the following extensions: 8BITMIME  RFC 1652 AUTH      RFC 2554 STARTTLS  RFC 3207 Additional extensions may be handled by clients.
It resolves to the offset of the thread-local symbol from the thread pointer (R13) and inserts this value into the low 16 bits of an instruction word.
It returns uintptr instead of unsafe.Pointer so that code using reflect cannot obtain unsafe.Pointers without importing the unsafe package explicitly.
It will accept any text file and generate a Profile out of it with any hex addresses it can identify, including a process map if it can recognize one.
It's hard to build a self-contained test for this because we can't build compatible types in one package with different items so something is ignored.
Not all, though: there are some variadic functions in package runtime and reflect, and for those we use call-specific metadata recorded by f's caller.
Note that inst has been passed by value and contains no pointers, so any changes we make here are local and will not propagate back out to the caller.
On systems with link registers, the prologue for a non-leaf function stores the incoming value of LR at the bottom of the newly allocated stack frame.
Otherwise, a second goroutine can lock the scan state by setting _Gscan in the status bit and then modify gcscanvalid, and then unlock the scan state.
PC-relative addressing is relative to the end of the instruction, but the relocations applied by the linker are relative to the end of the relocation.
R_CALLMIPS (only used on mips64) resolves to non-PC-relative target address of a CALL (JAL) instruction, by encoding the address into the instruction.
Rest of file is in the format encoding/base64/base64.go:34.44,37.40 3 1 where the fields are: name.go:line.column,line.column numberOfStatements count
SET and SET OF (tag 17) are mapped to SEQUENCE and SEQUENCE OF (tag 16) since we don't distinguish between ordered and unordered objects in this code.
TODO(gri) If we don't have an exported function body, the parameter names are irrelevant for the compiler (though they may be of use for other tools).
The 5 here and below depends on the number of internal runtime frames that sit between a deferred function called during panic and the original frame.
The current and next slices are work queues: current lists the fields to visit on this depth level, and next lists the fields on the next lower level.
The earlier index entries are the indices of the embedded fields implicitly traversed to get from (the type of) x to f, starting at embedding depth 0.
The returned Cmd's Args field is constructed from the command name followed by the elements of arg, so arg should not include the command name itself.
The tools that process the memory profiles assume that the profile rate is constant across the lifetime of the program and equal to the current value.
This example shows how to use big.Float to compute the square root of 2 with a precision of 200 bits, and how to print the result as a decimal number.
Top-level functions, such as Float64 and Int, use a default shared Source that produces a deterministic sequence of values each time a program is run.
Use the actual source file extent rather than *ast.File extent since the latter doesn't include comments which appear at the start or end of the file.
We generate random temporary file names so that there's a good chance the file doesn't exist yet - keeps the number of tries in TempFile to a minimum.
We never use packed registers, so a MOVSD between registers can be replaced by MOVAPD, which moves the pair of float64s instead of just the lower one.
When dynamically linking, we create LSym's by reading the names from the symbol tables of the shared libraries and so the names need to match exactly.
allIdents returns the names of the identifiers under the Ident field of the node, which might be a singleton (Identifier) or a slice (Field or Chain).
convert to little endian TODO(gri) go/constant should have a more direct conversion function (e.g., once it supports a big.Float based implementation)
current block number dclstack maintains a stack of shadowed symbol declarations so that popdcl can restore their declarations when a block scope ends.
tflag values must be kept in sync with copies in: cmd/compile/internal/gc/reflect.go cmd/link/internal/ld/decodesym.go reflect/type.go runtime/type.go
type-checked ASTs may contain cycles - use ptrmap to keep track of objects that have been printed already and print the respective line number instead
windows doesn't work, because Windows exception handling delivers signals based on the current PC, and that current PC doesn't go into the Go runtime.
x is a bidirectional channel value, T is a channel type, x's type V and T have identical element types, and at least one of V or T is not a named type
(note: no leading spaces and no space in "//go") where command is the generator to be run, corresponding to an executable file that can be run locally.
A duration string is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "-1.5h" or "2h45m".
A goroutine is used to preprocess the input by merging lines, removing spaces in hex values and identifying the start of new keys and signature blocks.
A lineInfo object describes alternative file and line number information (such as provided via a //line comment in a .go file) for a given file offset.
Although the history at any given line number is a stack, the record for all line processed forms a tree, with common stack prefixes acting as parents.
And if there are bugs, they're more likely in the current development tree than in a standard release like Go 1.4, so don't do this rebuild by default.
But we use the unbuffered channel 'rc' to guarantee that persistConn.roundTrip got out of its select potentially waiting for this persistConn to close.
Clone can be used to prepare common templates and use them with variant definitions for other templates by adding the variants after the clone is made.
Each Time has associated with it a Location, consulted when computing the presentation form of the time, such as in the Format, Hour, and Year methods.
Fake node that all - return values and output variables - parameters on imported functions not marked 'safe' - assignments to global variables flow to.
For example, registering "/images/" causes ServeMux to redirect a request for "/images" to "/images/", unless "/images" has been registered separately.
Format right-aligned in space-separated columns of minimal width 5 and at least one blank of padding (so wider column entries do not touch each other).
If fracOk is set, an octal prefix is ignored (a leading ``0'' simply stands for a zero digit), and a period followed by a fractional part is permitted.
If parent is x/y/z, then path might expand to x/y/z/vendor/path, x/y/vendor/path, x/vendor/path, vendor/path, or else stay path if none of those exist.
If the low bit is set in x or y, adding or subtracting 1 produces a number that checkdiv1 is going to be called with anyway, so don't duplicate effort.
If the use of -a wasn't a red flag, the use of -installsuffix to point to a non-existent directory in a command that installs nothing should have been.
ImportedSymbols returns the names of all symbols referred to by the binary f that are expected to be satisfied by other libraries at dynamic load time.
In a valid Go program, those nodes always have zero dependencies (after removing all incoming dependencies), otherwise there are initialization cycles.
In addition to the 16 bits taken from the top, we can take 3 from the bottom, because node must be pointer-aligned, giving a total of 19 bits of count.
In this case, since the entire transition is a g+SP update, a partial transition updating just one of those will be detected by the stack bounds check.
Instead of extra bookkeeping on all our VirtualAlloc calls, try freeing successively smaller pieces until we manage to free something, and then repeat.
Internal Directories Code in or below a directory named "internal" is importable only by code in the directory tree rooted at the parent of "internal".
Issue 3925: wrong line number for error message "missing key in map literal" also a test for correct line number in other malformed composite literals.
Issue 7405: the equality function for struct with many embedded fields became more complex after fixing issue 7366, leading to out of registers on 386.
It does not check stack correctness, completeness or anything else: it merely verifies that if a test is expected to be racy then the race is detected.
It is an internal package because these details are specific to the Go team's test setup (on build.golang.org) and not fundamental to tests in general.
It is much more difficult for the C world to have pointers into the Go world, because the Go garbage collector is unaware of the memory allocated by C.
It is possible to defeat this enforcement by using the unsafe package, and of course there is nothing stopping the C code from doing anything it likes.
It panics if a value in the map is not a function with appropriate return type or if the name cannot be used syntactically as a function in a template.
It's swapped in when we don't actually want to consume the body, but need a non-nil one, and want to distinguish the error from reading the dummy body.
Like the Go select statement, it blocks until at least one of the cases can proceed, makes a uniform pseudo-random choice, and then executes that case.
Note that sometimes we use a lowercase //sys name and wrap it in our own nicer implementation, either here or in syscall_solaris.go or syscall_unix.go.
On Windows, we test the real registry on the machine and assume that ".png" exists there, which empirically it always has, for all versions of Windows.
So we're iterating through the oldbucket, skipping any keys that will go to the other new bucket (each oldbucket expands to two buckets during a grow).
Special-purpose environment variables: GOROOT_FINAL The root of the installed Go tree, when it is installed in a location other than where it is built.
The cutoff is sys.PtrSize*8 - 7 to guarantee that when we add the pattern to a bit buffer holding at most 7 bits (a partial byte) it will not overflow.
This is a NULL parameters value which is technically superfluous, but most other code includes it and, by doing this, we match their public key hashes.
This is both an optimization and a hedge against the Mach-O parsing failing in the future due to, for example, the name of the __text section changing.
This part of the stack will be re-scanned by mark termination, which will mark any objects made reachable from modifications to this part of the stack.
This tension is resolved by allocating white until the mark phase is approaching its end and then allocating black for the remainder of the mark phase.
Those widths must be cleared to avoid triggering failures in gins when it detects real but heretofore latent (and one hopes innocuous) type mismatches.
To accommodate services publishing SRV records under non-standard names, if both service and proto are empty strings, LookupSRV looks up name directly.
To cut one instruction from the check sequence for functions with tiny frames, the stack is allowed to protrude StackSmall bytes below the stack guard.
Unmarshal uses the inverse of the encodings that Marshal uses, allocating maps, slices, and pointers as necessary, with the following additional rules:
Values override any extensions that would otherwise be produced based on the other fields but are overridden by any extensions specified in Attributes.
We can't easily check that the type is *testing.M because we don't know how testing has been imported, but at least check that it's *M or *something.M.
When parsing a time with a zone abbreviation like MST, if the zone abbreviation has a defined offset in the current location, then that offset is used.
Write .debug_info Compilation Unit Header (sec 7.5.1) Fields marked with (*) must be changed for 64-bit dwarf This must match COMPUNITHEADERSIZE above.
Write implements the standard Write interface: it writes data to the pipe, blocking until readers have consumed all the data or the read end is closed.
checkCopyLocksFunc checks whether a function might inadvertently copy a lock, by checking whether its receiver, parameters, or return values are locks.
cloneTLSConfig returns a shallow clone of the exported fields of cfg, ignoring the unexported sync.Once, which contains a mutex and must not be copied.
contextAfterText starts in context c, consumes some tokens from the front of s, then returns the context after those tokens and the unprocessed suffix.
format parses src, prints the corresponding AST, verifies the resulting src is syntactically correct, and returns the resulting src or an error if any.
formatting golden must be idempotent (This is very difficult to achieve in general and for now it is only checked for files explicitly marked as such.)
get dequeues a pointer for the garbage collector to trace, blocking if necessary to ensure all pointers from all queues and caches have been retrieved.
peekBufferSeparatorIndex returns the index of mr.nlDashBoundary in peek and whether it is a real boundary (and not a prefix of an unrelated separator).
should have been resolved by typechecking case OCLOSURE: unimplemented - handled by default case case OCOMPLIT: unimplemented - handled by default case
testFlags processes the command line, grabbing -x and -c, rewriting known flags to have "test" before them, and reading the command line for the 6.out.
ticketKeyNameLen is the number of bytes of identifier that is prepended to an encrypted session ticket in order to identify the key used to encrypt it.
(The parent package is not nil if the the name is an unqualified struct field or interface method name belonging to a type declared in another package.)
1) Of those fields, if any are JSON-tagged, only tagged fields are considered, even if there are multiple untagged fields that would otherwise conflict.
A valueMap maps a case value (of a basic Go type) to a list of positions where the same case value appeared, together with the corresponding case types.
As a heuristic, we move this assist to the back of the queue so that large assists can't clog up the assist queue and substantially delay small assists.
As an optimization, those etype-specific structs which contain exactly one pointer-shaped field are stored as values rather than pointers when possible.
At entry, r12 holds the address of the symbol resolver stub for the target routine and the argument registers hold the arguments for the target routine.
Best is to split blocks until one more split would take longer (because of the nat/nat div()) than the twice as many divW()'s of the iterative approach.
CommonPrefixLen doesn't really make sense for IPv4, and even causes problems for common load balancing practices (e.g., https://golang.org/issue/13283).
Data is processed before segtext, because we need to see all symbols in the .data and .bss sections in order to generate garbage collection information.
Description of build modes The 'go build' and 'go install' commands take a -buildmode argument which indicates which kind of object file is to be built.
Due to the Transport's "socket late binding" (see idleConnCh in transport.go), the numReqs HTTP requests below can finish with a dial still outstanding.
Even if all the variables were updated correctly, it is not clear that we want to expose a traceback that begins on one stack and ends on another stack.
For HTTP requests, as part of hardening against request smuggling (RFC 7230), don't allow a Content-Length header for methods which don't permit bodies.
For example, deferproc might call malloc, which does one of the above checks (without allocating a full frame), which might trigger a call to morestack.
For example, the map runtime routines take the map key by reference, so make sure all map keys are addressable by copying them to temporaries as needed.
However, a stream with an empty HCLEN tree is guaranteed to fail since it will attempt to use the tree to decode the codes for the HLIT and HDIST trees.
However, gc only gives us likeliness hints in a single place, for plain OIF statements, and passing around context is finnicky, so don't bother for now.
HuffmanDecode decodes the string in v and writes the expanded result to w, returning the number of bytes written to w and the Write call's return value.
If parent is true, the walk stops at the next-to-last element in the name, so that ip is the parent directory and elem is the final element in the path.
If rt.RoundTrip returns ErrSkipAltProtocol, the Transport will handle the RoundTrip itself for that one request, as if the protocol were not registered.
If the size was wrong, we'll either waste some space off the end or reallocate as needed, but in the overwhelmingly common case we'll get it just right.
It's hard to tell so we settle on the heuristic that names without dots (like "localhost" or "myhost") do not get trailing dots, but any other names do.
Its presence in Request.MultipartForm indicates that parsing of the request body has been handed off to a MultipartReader instead of ParseMultipartFrom.
New spans can be created while GC progresses, but they are not garbage for this round: - new stack spans can be created even while the world is stopped.
R_ADDRMIPSU (only used on mips64) resolves to the sign-adjusted "upper" 16 bits (bit 16-31) of an external address, by encoding it into the instruction.
References: RFC 5915 SEC1 - http://www.secg.org/sec1-v2.pdf Per RFC 5915 the NamedCurveOID is marked as ASN.1 OPTIONAL, however in most cases it is not.
Such a file is usually paired with another file implementing the default functionality for other systems, which in this case would carry the constraint:
TODO(dfc): constants that should be in zsysnum_linux_arm64.go, remove these when the deprecated syscalls that the syscall package relies on are removed.
TODO: specify which of the caller and callee is responsible for IP addresses, for leading and trailing dots, for case sensitivity, and for IDN/Punycode.
Test that we can read the values and files of a multipart request with FormValue and FormFile, and that ParseMultipartForm can be called multiple times.
Tests that compressing and then decompressing the given file at the given compression level and dictionary yields equivalent bytes to the original file.
The GOTRACEBACK variable controls the amount of output generated when a Go program fails due to an unrecovered panic or an unexpected runtime condition.
The Node.curfn field is supposed to be set to the current function already, but for some compiler-introduced names it seems not to be, so fix that here.
The build flags are shared by the build, clean, get, install, list, run, and test commands: -a force rebuilding of packages that are already up-to-date.
The component's (h, v) is effectively always (1, 1): even if the nominal (h, v) is (2, 1), a 20x5 image is encoded in three 8x8 MCUs, not two 16x8 MCUs.
The rule is to display all the prefixes not implied by the usual instruction display, that is, all the prefixes except the ones with PrefixImplicit set.
The shell now searches each directory specified by the PATH environment variable, in the order listed, for an executable file matching the command name.
The slice is valid for use only until the next buffer modification (that is, only until the next call to a method like Read, Write, Reset, or Truncate).
This could be surprising behavior to retroactively apply to driver.String now that Go1 is out, but this is convenient for our TestPointerParamsAndScans.
This hides the start-up pauses, which are much smaller than the normal pauses and would otherwise make the average look much better than it actually is.
This is even more pronounced on relaxed memory architectures since we access arena_used without barriers or synchronization, but the same logic applies.
To avoid denial of service attacks, the provided bufio.Reader should be reading from an io.LimitReader or similar Reader to bound the size of responses.
To avoid problems on case-insensitive files, we reject any package where two different input files have equal names under a case-insensitive comparison.
To do lazy symbol lookup right, we're supposed to tell the dynamic loader which library each symbol comes from and format the link info section just so.
To prevent duplicate operations, ErrBadConn should NOT be returned if there's a possibility that the database server might have performed the operation.
Unfortunately the cost of ensuring that the object holding the slot doesn't concurrently change to black without the mutator noticing seems prohibitive.
We either have the paramnodes, which may be connected to other things through flows or we have the parameter type nodes, which may be marked "noescape".
WriteMsgUDP writes a packet to addr via c if c isn't connected, or to c's remote destination address if c is connected (in which case addr must be nil).
asciiEqualFold is a specialization of bytes.EqualFold for use when s is all ASCII (but may contain non-letters) and contains no special-folding letters.
but also: "If a message is received with both a Transfer-Encoding and a Content-Length header field, the Transfer-Encoding overrides the Content-Length.
lookingForIndex: 1 iff we are still looking for the 0x01 index: the offset of the first 0x01 byte invalid: 1 iff we saw a non-zero byte before the 0x01.
no static check is required if T is an interface spec: "If T is an interface type, x.(T) asserts that the dynamic type of x implements the interface T."
smallPrimes is a list of small, prime numbers that allows us to rapidly exclude some fraction of composite candidates when searching for a random prime.
unconditional branch can happen in the middle of floating point if the linker decides it is time to lay down a sequence of instruction stream constants.
writeBlockHuff encodes a block of bytes as either Huffman encoded literals or uncompressed bytes if the results only gains very little from compression.
(The "http://www.w3.org/2000/xmlns/" name space is also predefined as "xmlns", but users should not be trying to use that one directly - that's our job.)
- A type assertion x.(T) where T is an interface type is invalid if any (statically known) method that exists for both x and T have different signatures.
A decimal point followed by one or more nines represents a fractional second, printed to the given number of decimal places, with trailing zeros removed.
Although DWARF specifies the lowpc attribute, comments in gdb/dwarf2read.c say that some versions of GCC use the entrypc attribute, so we check that too.
As of 2014-04-02, doing this to the godoc binary is actually a net loss: we save about 50k of argument bitmaps but the new PCDATA tables cost about 100k.
BreakWithError causes the next Read (waking up a current blocked Read if needed) to return the provided err immediately, without waiting for unread data.
By default, a failure prints a stack trace for the current goroutine, eliding functions internal to the run-time system, and then exits with exit code 2.
CTR converts a block cipher into a stream cipher by repeatedly encrypting an incrementing counter and xoring the resulting stream of data with the input.
Due to broken stack memory accounting (https://golang.org/issue/7468), StackInuse can decrease during function execution, so we cast the values to int64.
Functions like chansend and mapassign don't escape the referent, but may escape anything the referent points to (they do shallow copies of the referent).
Gcc only generates DWARF info for symbols in the object file, so it is not enough to print the preamble and hope the symbols we care about will be there.
GeneralString is specified in ISO-2022/ECMA-35, A brief review suggests that it includes structures that allow the encoding to change midstring and such.
If an error occurs executing the template or writing its output, execution stops, but partial results may already have been written to the output writer.
If s is well-formed and near a valid floating point number, ParseFloat returns the nearest floating point number rounded using IEEE754 unbiased rounding.
In Go 1.1, the actual wire flush is delayed, so we could maybe tack on a Content-Length and better Content-Type after we see more (or all) of the output.
Instead of reducing the running count of this test before calling the tRunner and increasing it afterwards, we rely on tRunner keeping the count correct.
It does not see the panic when called from a call within a deferred call (too late) nor does it see the panic when it *is* the deferred call (too early).
It is allowed to call Notify multiple times with different channels and the same signals: each channel receives copies of incoming signals independently.
It only needs to process the .o files generated from C files that cgo writes, and those are much more limited in the ELF or other features that they use.
LastIndexAny returns the index of the last instance of any Unicode code point from chars in s, or -1 if no Unicode code point from chars is present in s.
NB: simply checking the exit code of `git rev-parse --git-dir` would suffice here, but that requires deviating from the infrastructure provided by `run`.
No scanning of objects (making them black) can happen until all Ps have enabled the write barrier, but that already happened in the transition to GCscan.
On 32-bit, once the reservation is gone we can try to get memory at a location chosen by the OS and hope that it is in the range we allocated bitmap for.
One will be returned to the caller and the other will be used as transfer buffer for end times history and as a temporary buffer for computing quantiles.
OpenSSL does print an "ACCEPT" banner, but it does so *before* opening the listening socket, so we can't use that to wait until it has started listening.
ParseTime parses a time header (such as the Date: header), trying each of the three formats allowed by HTTP/1.1: TimeFormat, time.RFC850, and time.ANSIC.
Programs that must disable HTTP/2 can do so by setting Transport.TLSNextProto (for clients) or Server.TLSNextProto (for servers) to a non-nil, empty map.
RFC 1951 3.2.7 specifies a special run-length encoding for specifying the literal and offset lengths arrays (which are concatenated into a single array).
ReadCodeLine reads a response code line of the form code message where code is a three-digit status code and the message extends to the rest of the line.
References: Annotated XML spec: http://www.xml.com/axml/testaxml.htm XML name spaces: http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/ TODO(rsc): Test error handling.
Returns a success boolean, the number of bytes to skip from the start of the record in order to get the application payload, and an optional alert value.
Rewrite append(src, x, y, z) so that any side effects in x, y, z (including runtime panics) are evaluated in initialization statements before the append.
Second, check that longer lines match each other exactly, so that the Go compiler and write additional information that must be the same from run to run.
Send on an unbuffered or empty-buffered channel is the only operation in the entire runtime where one goroutine writes to the stack of another goroutine.
Setting the top two bits, rather than just the top bit, means that when two of these values are multiplied together, the result isn't ever one bit short.
TODO(austin): next_gc is based on heap_reachable, not heap_marked, which means the actual growth ratio technically isn't comparable to the trigger ratio.
TODO: Col is only called when defining a macro and all it cares about is increasing position to discover whether there is a blank before the parenthesis.
TestDualStackTCPListener tests both single and double listen to a test listener with various address families, different listening address and same port.
TestDualStackUDPListener tests both single and double listen to a test listener with various address families, different listening address and same port.
The argument finalizer must be a function that takes a single argument to which obj's type can be assigned, and can have arbitrary ignored return values.
The book-keeping structure hence grows logarithmically with the size of the stack and mark termination re-scans at most twice as much stack as necessary.
The decimal values may be used, provided that the compiler will convert from decimal to binary accurately enough to produce the hexadecimal values shown.
The embedding of types within structs imposes a tree structure onto types: structs parent the types they embed, and types parent their fields or methods.
The encoded form is: -----BEGIN Type----- Headers base64-encoded Bytes -----END Type----- where Headers is a possibly empty sequence of Key: Value lines.
The extra level of indirection ensures that no clients of os can overwrite this data, which could cause the finalizer to close the wrong file descriptor.
The order of work does not matter much to overall execution time, but when running "go test std" it is nice to see each test results as soon as possible.
There can be a race between the socket pool checking whether a socket is still connected, receiving the FIN, and sending/reading data on a reused socket.
These instructions are marked as RightAddr so that the register optimizer does not try to replace the memory references with integer register references.
This is package 'bad' rather than 'main' so the erroneous build tag doesn't end up looking like a package doc for the vet command when examined by godoc.
This is similar to the URI to IRI encoding scheme defined in section 3.1 of  RFC 3987, and behaves the same as the EcmaScript builtin encodeURIComponent.
This step is only needed if we believe that the Go compiler built from Go 1.4 will produce different object files than the Go compiler built from itself.
TrackingWriter tracks the last byte written on every write so we can avoid printing a newline if one was already written or if there is no output at all.
We *do* need to enforce that this is at least 1, since marking is racy and double-scanning objects may legitimately make the expected scan work negative.
We know that the waiter is in the cond.Wait() call because we synchronized with it, then acquired/released the mutex it was holding when we synchronized.
When a disassembly does not match the internal decoding, allowedMismatch determines whether this mismatch should be allowed, or else considered an error.
dst and src reference the same base ONAME Here we also assume that the statement will not contain calls, that is, that order will move any calls to init.
finishedSum30 calculates the contents of the verify_data member of a SSLv3 Finished message given the MD5 and SHA1 hashes of a set of handshake messages.
func netpollready(gpp **g, pd *pollDesc, mode int32) pollDesc contains 2 binary semaphores, rg and wg, to park reader and writer goroutines respectively.
haspointers updates Type.Haspointers as a side effect, so exercise this function on all inputs so that reflect.DeepEqual doesn't produce false positives.
ld64 for arm seems to want the symbol table to contain offset into the section rather than pseudo virtual address that contains the section load address.
local names and hidden global names are unique and should only be referenced by their index, not name, so we don't bother to add them into the hash table
noteUnusedDriverStatement notes that si is no longer used and should be closed whenever possible (when c is next not in use), unless c is already closed.
spec: "The right operand in a shift expression must have unsigned integer type or be an untyped constant that can be converted to unsigned integer type."
these are approx the same as the corresponding adddot routines except that they expect to be called with unique tasks and they return the actual methods.
"local" here means in the sense of the dynamic linker, i.e. not visible outside of the module (shared library or executable) that contains its definition.
-1 means the driver doesn't know how to count the number of placeholders, so we won't sanity check input here and instead let the driver deal with errors.
A PingFrame is a mechanism for measuring a minimal round trip time from the sender, as well as determining whether an idle connection is still functional.
As a special case, durations less than one second format use a smaller unit (milli-, micro-, or nanoseconds) to ensure that the leading digit is non-zero.
Because we send on c.signal during a top-of-stack deferred function now, we know that the send only happens after any other stacked defers have completed.
Cases this gets wrong (TODO): - If a for loop's continuation statement mentions a variable redeclared in the block, we should complain about it but don't.
ColumnConverter may be optionally implemented by Stmt if the statement is aware of its own columns' types and can convert from any type to a driver Value.
Connection Name:  Wireless Network Connection Network Adapter:  Wireles WLAN Card Physical Address: XX-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX Transport Name:   Media disconnected
Constructs a complete CFG, solves for the liveness of pointer variables in the function, and emits a runtime data structure read by the garbage collector.
Double-check the heap bits written by GC program by running the GC program to create a 1-bit pointer mask and then jumping to the double-check code below.
FoldScript maps a script name to a table of code points outside the script that are equivalent under simple case folding to code points inside the script.
For client requests, setting this field prevents re-use of TCP connections between requests to the same hosts, as if Transport.DisableKeepAlives were set.
For each code range, compute nextcode (first code of that length), limit (last code of that length), and base (offset from first code to sequence number).
For example, instead of a binary distribution, copying a home directory from one directory or machine to another might copy files but not preserve mtimes.
For example, three passes could transmit the 6 most significant bits, followed by the second-least significant bit, followed by the least significant bit.
From Engineering Security, Peter Gutmann: A European government CA marked its signing certificates as being valid for encryption only, but no-one noticed.
Functions of the form func BenchmarkXxx(*testing.B) are considered benchmarks, and are executed by the "go test" command when its -bench flag is provided.
HashFunc returns an identifier for the hash function used to produce the message passed to Signer.Sign, or else zero to indicate that no hashing was done.
However, since all allocated one-word objects are pointers (non-pointers are aggregated into tinySize allocations), initSpan sets the pointer bits for us.
However, since they are comments, tools unaware of the directive convention or of a particular directive can skip over a directive like any other comment.
If an interface is sent, its type in the test is always NewType0, so this checks that the encoder and decoder don't skew with respect to type definitions.
If the MCentral free list is empty, replenish it by allocating a run of pages from the MHeap and then chopping that memory into objects of the given size.
Import imports a gc-generated package given its import path and srcDir, adds the corresponding package object to the packages map, and returns the object.
ImportFrom returns the imported package for the given import path when imported by the package in srcDir, or an error if the package couldn't be imported.
In general, an import path denotes either a standard package (such as "unicode/utf8") or a package found in one of the work spaces (see 'go help gopath').
Instead, we can change to a different epoch so long ago that all the times we care about will be positive, and then round to zero and round down coincide.
Ironically, ThreadSanitizer runtime contains a logical race condition that can lead to false negatives if racy accesses happen literally at the same time.
It matches the URL of each incoming request against a list of registered patterns and calls the handler for the pattern that most closely matches the URL.
It would be nice to avoid, at least in the common cases, but we need to make sure that misbehaving clients of reflect cannot affect other uses of reflect.
Less rare case: We also get here in the legitimate case of Issue 7569, where the writer is still writing (or stalled), but the server has already replied.
Most uses of Format and Parse use constant layout strings such as the ones defined in this package, but the interface is flexible, as these examples show.
Note that this function still works properly even when sparse files are being used since numBytes returns the bytes remaining in the underlying io.Reader.
Operands have an (addressing) mode, the expression evaluating to the operand, the operand's type, a value for constants, and an id for built-in functions.
Otherwise it is sent as a minimal-length big-endian (high byte first) byte stream holding the value, preceded by one byte holding the byte count, negated.
PrologueEnd indicates that Address is one (of possibly many) PCs where execution should be suspended for a breakpoint on entry to the containing function.
Rare case: the request was written in writeLoop above but before it could send to pc.writeErrCh, the reader read it all, processed it, and called us here.
Running "go vet" can help find uses of Pointer that do not conform to these patterns, but silence from "go vet" is not a guarantee that the code is valid.
Size of the trailing by_size array differs between Go and C, NumSizeClasses was changed, but we cannot change Go struct because of backward compatibility.
TODO(gri) Optimization: Probably worthwhile collecting long runs of constants and export them "in bulk" (saving tags and types, and making import faster).
TODO(shanemhansen): we might want to use PAX headers for subsecond time resolution, but for now let's just capture too long fields or non ascii characters
Tables of category and script folding exceptions: code points that must be added when interpreting a particular category/script in a case-folding context.
Test to make sure that a pointer value which is alive across a call is retained, even when there are matching conversions to/from uintptr around the call.
The empty string must be preserved inside parens in order to make submatches work right, so these tests are less interesting than they might otherwise be.
The server calls ReadRequestHeader and ReadRequestBody in pairs to read requests from the connection, and it calls WriteResponse to write a response back.
The suggested increment frequency for PowerPC's time base register is 512 MHz according to Power ISA v2.07 section 6.2, so we use 16 on ppc64 and ppc64le.
These are only considered synchronous when caused by program execution, not when sent using os.Process.Kill or the kill program or some similar mechanism.
These constants are the ARM condition codes encodings, XORed with 14 so that C_SCOND_NONE has value 0, so that a zeroed Prog.scond means "always execute".
These fields are read and written with the singleflight mutex held before the WaitGroup is done, and are read but not written after the WaitGroup is done.
This also blocks until any remaining mark 1 workers have exited their loop so we can start new mark 2 workers that will observe the new root marking jobs.
This behavior was confusing when using non-trivial GOPATHs, which were particularly common with some code management conventions, like the original godep.
This is done for a number of reasons, but the most obvious is to ensure that the value is large enough that the exponentiation is larger than the modulus.
To ensure that we get rewrite the Trunc32to16 before we rewrite the Store, we force the truncate into an earlier basic block by using it on both branches.
We could embed the text/template field, but it's safer not to because we need to keep our version of the name space and the underlying template's in sync.
We do our own vendor resolution, because we want to find out the key to use in packageCache without the overhead of repeated calls to buildContext.Import.
We only care about liveness info at call sites, so putting the varkill in the store chain is enough to keep it correctly ordered with respect to call ops.
checkTestFunctions walks Test, Benchmark and Example functions checking malformed names, wrong signatures and examples documenting inexistent identifiers.
cmd/link Command Line Interface The go command and any other Go-aware build systems invoke cmd/link to link a collection of packages into a single binary.
deadline returns the earliest of: - now+Timeout - d.Deadline - the context's deadline Or zero, if none of Timeout, Deadline, or context's deadline is set.
function call arg reordering was picking out 1 call that didn't need to be in a temporary, but it was picking out the first call instead of the last call.
fuseCompareBranch finds comparisons followed by a branch and converts them into a compare-and-branch instruction (which avoid setting the condition code).
now the map is not empty and range triggers an event should work without this (as in other tests) so it is suspicious if this test passes and others don't
scan sets z to the integer value corresponding to the longest possible prefix read from r representing a signed integer number in a given conversion base.
some data symbols (e.g. masks) end up in the .text section, and they normally expect larger alignment requirement than the default text section alignment.
the contract with the driver.Next(...) interface is that it can return slices into read-only temporary memory that's only valid until the next Scan/Close.
A return instruction with a p.to is a tail return, which brings the stack pointer back up (if it ever went down) and then jumps to a new function entirely.
As per the PNG spec, a PLTE chunk is optional (and for practical purposes, ignorable) for the ctTrueColor and ctTrueColorAlpha color types (section 4.1.2).
Because many other build systems have the same sensitivity to mtimes, most programs manipulating source code take pains not to break the mtime assumptions.
Because the parser doesn't know the composite literal type, it cannot know if a key that's an identifier is a struct field name or a name denoting a value.
Check that every function behaves correctly with this amount of stack, following direct calls in order to piece together chains of non-splitting functions.
Clients should use those packages to construct templates rather than this one, which provides shared internal data structures not intended for general use.
Each call to SeekPC starts the search at the compilation unit of the last call, so in general looking up a series of PCs will be faster if they are sorted.
Eval functions evaluate pipelines, commands, and their elements and extract values from the data structure by examining fields, calling methods, and so on.
For untyped values the conversion provides the type, per the spec: "A constant may be given a type explicitly by a constant declaration or conversion,...".
Gccgo incorrectly executed functions multiple times when they appeared in a composite literal that required a conversion between different interface types.
If MaxIdleConns is greater than 0 and the new MaxOpenConns is less than MaxIdleConns, then MaxIdleConns will be reduced to match the new MaxOpenConns limit
If c has a ConnectionState method like a *tls.Conn, the ConnectionState is used to verify the TLS ciphersuite and to set the Request.TLS field in Handlers.
If copying result bytes back, the caller must pass the argument frame type as argtype, so that call can execute appropriate write barriers during the copy.
If new, assign next number using uniq, record in remap, record in lv.livepointers and lv.argslivepointers under the new index, and add entry to hash table.
If the call blocks before tmp has been written, the garbage collector will still treat the temporary as live, so we must zero it before entering that call.
If the field type has an XMLName field, the names must match so that the behavior of both marshalling and unmarshalling is straightforward and unambiguous.
If the source was read but syntax errors were found, the result is a partial AST (with ast.Bad* nodes representing the fragments of erroneous source code).
If the value is nil, keep it untyped (this is important for tools such as go vet which need the dynamic type for argument checking of say, print functions)
If viaRequest is true, the URL is assumed to have arrived via an HTTP request, in which case only absolute URLs or path-absolute relative URLs are allowed.
If we have changed the working directory, make sure we have an absolute path, because we are going to change directory back before we remove the temporary.
It reports whether the value represented by f is guaranteed to be the best approximation of d after being rounded to a float64 or float32 depending on flt.
Make racy client program work: if panicking on another goroutine at the same time as main returns, let the other goroutine finish printing the panic trace.
Make sure the overflow pointer is the last memory in the struct, because the runtime assumes it can use size-ptrSize as the offset of the overflow pointer.
NOTE(rsc): Could use getrlimit here, like on FreeBSD or Linux, but Darwin doesn't enforce ulimit -v, so it's unclear why we'd try to stay within the limit.
NOTE(rsc): I haven't worked out why (really when) we should ignore the addend on a scattered relocation, but it seems that the common case is we ignore it.
Not sure it's useful and may even be bad but it works and it's hard to prevent without exposing the contents of the object, which would defeat the purpose.
Only print about the exit status if the command didn't even run (not an ExitError) or it didn't exit cleanly or we're printing command lines too (-x mode).
Reset clears the state of the Writer z such that it is equivalent to its initial state from NewWriterLevel or NewWriterLevelDict, but instead writing to w.
Reset discards the Writer z's state and makes it equivalent to the result of its original state from NewWriter or NewWriterLevel, but writing to w instead.
TODO(rsc): Maybe use prefix and the initial input to record the header line from the file, which would give the architecture and other version information.
The MPEG Software Simulation Group does not represent or warrant that the programs furnished hereunder are free of infringement of any third-party patents.
The cgo program will rewrite all possibly bad pointer arguments to call cgoCheckPointer, where we can catch cases of a Go pointer pointing to a Go pointer.
The compilation of a package records the relevant information to support both linking modes, leaving the decision to be made when linking the final binary.
The linker uses this as a signal that the pointed-to type information should be linked into the final binary, even if there are no other direct references.
The register allocator assumes that all live code in the function can be traversed by starting at all the RET instructions and following predecessor links.
The slice aliases the buffer content at least until the next buffer modification, so immediate changes to the slice will affect the result of future reads.
The vcs is one of "git", "hg", "svn", etc, The repo-root is the root of the version control system containing a scheme and not containing a .vcs qualifier.
This makes it easy to add fixup code on merge edges - the source of a merge edge has only one successor, so we can add fixup code to the end of that block.
This may not be the case if GC start is delayed or if the allocation that pushed heap_live over next_gc is large or if the trigger is really close to GOGC.
Use the comment map to filter comments that don't belong anymore (the comments associated with the variable declaration), and create the new comments list.
Using -2 suffices to pass all the tests we have written so far, which we assume matches the level of complexity we want the escape analysis code to handle.
Using a pseudo-import path like this makes the ./ imports no longer a special case, so that all the code to deal with ordinary imports works automatically.
Various runtime operations such as sends to unbuffered channels can write to arbitrary parts of the stack, including above the lowest un-hit stack barrier.
We don't try to maintain a single cgoSymbolizerArg for the whole use of Frames, because there would be no good way to tell the symbolizer when we are done.
We need to search our list of client certs for one where SignatureAlgorithm is acceptable to the server and the Issuer is in certReq.certificateAuthorities
When parsing (only), the input may contain a fractional second field immediately after the seconds field, even if the layout does not signify its presence.
When running a large set of sequential test cases, checking Coverage after each one can be useful for identifying which test cases exercise new code paths.
connError returns ConnectionError(code) but first stashes away a public reason to the caller can optionally relay it to the peer before hanging up on them.
gcBitsArenas.next becomes the gcBitsArenas.current where the GC will mark objects and after each span is swept these bits will be used to allocate objects.
isLoopSpillCandidate indicates whether the spill for v satisfies preliminary spill-sinking conditions just after the last block of loop has been processed.
print before panic, as panic may get lost due to conflicting panic (all goroutines asleep) elsewhere, since we might not unlock the mutex in freeConn here.
seqNum is a sequence number so that Cookies returns cookies in a deterministic order, even for cookies that have equal Path length and equal Creation time.
validateStructTag parses the struct tag and returns an error if it is not in the canonical format, which is a space-separated list of key:"value" settings.
A Value can be used concurrently by multiple goroutines provided that the underlying Go value can be used concurrently for the equivalent direct operations.
A nil URL and nil error are returned if no proxy is defined in the environment, or a proxy should not be used for the given request, as defined by NO_PROXY.
A transition function takes a context and template text input, and returns the updated context and the number of bytes consumed from the front of the input.
Algorithm: 1) convert Float to multiprecision decimal 2) round to desired precision 3) read digits out and format 1) convert Float to multiprecision decimal
At time of writing, re2-exhaustive.txt is 59 MB but compresses to 385 kB, so we store re2-exhaustive.txt.bz2 in the repository and decompress it on the fly.
Backward copies come as the tuple (dist, length) where dist determines how far back in the stream to copy from and length determines how many bytes to copy.
Because of this, glibc's dynamic ELF loader occasionally (like in version 2.13) assumes that a dynamic binary always refers to at least one dynamic library.
Flags: 'l' print definition, not name 'h' omit 'func' and receiver from function types, short type names 'u' package name, not prefix (FTypeId mode, sticky)
Functions that need frames bigger than this use an extra instruction to do the stack split check, to avoid overflow in case SP - framesize wraps below zero.
If it proves to be a performance hit we should be able to make these simple atomic stores but for now we are going to throw if we see an inconsistent state.
If p points into an allocated object, it can be advanced through the object by conversion to uintptr, addition of an offset, and conversion back to Pointer.
If possible to convert decimal representation to 64-bit float f exactly, entirely in floating-point math, do so, avoiding the expense of decimalToFloatBits.
If the GC is in some way dependent on this goroutine (for example, it needs a lock held by the goroutine), that small preemption turns into a real deadlock.
If the import of "C" is immediately preceded by a comment, that comment, called the preamble, is used as a header when compiling the C parts of the package.
If the pointer passed to it is non-nil, the caller wants the reservation there, but SysReserve can still choose another location if that one is unavailable.
If the set of possible relations m is included in the set of relations need to take the positive branch (or negative) then that branch will always be taken.
In XML name spaces, the translations listed in the attributes apply to the element name and to the other attribute names, so process the translations first.
In general headers with the same name as those found in the header struct overwrite those found in the header struct with higher precision or longer values.
In general, types - but also objects referred to from inlined function bodies - can be reexported and so we need to know which package they are coming from.
IsSystemDLL reports whether the named dll key (a base name, like "foo.dll") is a system DLL which should only be loaded from the Windows SYSTEM32 directory.
It doesn't handle copying of aggregates as well as I would like, nor variables with their address taken, and it's too subtle to turn on this late in Go 1.2.
It is equivalent to RightWrite except that having the RightAddr bit set keeps the registerizer from trying to substitute a register for the memory location.
MakeTable will always return this value when asked to make a Castagnoli table so we can compare against it to find when the caller is using this polynomial.
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-38A, ``Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation,'' 2001 Edition, pp.
Platforms with hardware accelerated implementations of AES should implement their own version of newCipher (which may then call newCipherGeneric if needed).
Such a message might indicate an attempt to perform request smuggling (Section 9.5) or response splitting (Section 9.4) and ought to be handled as an error.
Such a package will be recognized regardless of this flag setting (because it has source code) and will have BinaryOnly set to true in the returned Package.
TODO(jsing): For some reason DragonFly seems to return memory at a different address than we requested, even when there should be no reason for it to do so.
TestUnixRightsRoundtrip tests that UnixRights, ParseSocketControlMessage, and ParseUnixRights are able to successfully round-trip lists of file descriptors.
The Compressor itself must be safe to invoke from multiple goroutines simultaneously, but each returned writer will be used only by one goroutine at a time.
The inlining facility makes 2 passes: first caninl determines which functions are suitable for inlining, and for those that are it saves a copy of the body.
The other important fact is the size of a pointer: on 32-bit systems the LR takes up only 4 bytes on the stack, while on 64-bit systems it takes up 8 bytes.
There are various function pointers that should be set too, but those depend on dynamic linker magic to get initialized correctly, and sometimes they break.
This function is not an anonymous func, so that the compiler can do escape analysis and place x on stack (and subsequently stack growth update the pointer).
This script supports an extra flag, -lldb, that pauses execution just before the main program begins and allows the user to control the remote lldb session.
To import a package solely for its side-effects (initialization), use the blank identifier as explicit package name." check use of regular imported packages
Unlike ClassExprLoc/ClassBlock, some DWARF 4 attributes need to distinguish Class*Ptr from ClassConstant, so we only do this promotion for versions 2 and 3.
Use a Transport with a custom dialer that returns a fake net.Conn that waits for the full input (and recording it), and then responds with a dummy response.
We want to give handlers a chance to hijack the connection, but we need to prevent the Server from dealing with the connection further if it's not hijacked.
You can control this by setting the CGO_ENABLED environment variable when running the go tool: set it to 1 to enable the use of cgo, and to 0 to disable it.
and Returns the boolean AND of its arguments by returning the first empty argument or the last argument, that is, "and x y" behaves as "if x then y else x".
assigning to a struct field is like assigning to the struct but here this subtlety is lost, since s.a counts as an assignment to a track-losing dereference.
case OCONV, OCONVIFACE, OCONVNOP, OARRAYBYTESTR, OARRAYRUNESTR, OSTRARRAYBYTE, OSTRARRAYRUNE, ORUNESTR: unreachable - mapped to OCONV case below by exporter
escapeTemplate rewrites the named template, which must be associated with t, to guarantee that the output of any of the named templates is properly escaped.
myStringReader implements Read but not ReadRune, allowing us to test our readRune wrapper type that creates something that can read runes given only Read().
Add stores value in an internal map, so value must be suitable for use as a map key and will not be garbage collected until the corresponding call to Remove.
Asm, typically invoked as ``go tool asm'', assembles the source file into an object file named for the basename of the argument source file with a .o suffix.
Because null is often used in JSON to mean ``not present,'' unmarshaling a JSON null into any other Go type has no effect on the value and produces no error.
By default the pure Go resolver is used, because a blocked DNS request consumes only a goroutine, while a blocked C call consumes an operating system thread.
Consume a group of adjacent comments, add it to the parser's comments list, and return it together with the line at which the last comment in the group ends.
Deprecated: The supported way to create a compiled-only package is to write source code containing a //go:binary-only-package comment at the top of the file.
DualStack enables RFC 6555-compliant "Happy Eyeballs" dialing when the network is "tcp" and the destination is a host name with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
For generated Go code, such as package syscall's data structures, we drop a common prefix (so sec, usec, which will get turned into Sec, Usec for exporting).
GC scans all goroutine stacks, mark and enqueues all encountered pointers (marking avoids most duplicate enqueuing but races may produce benign duplication).
If answer errored for rcodes dnsRcodeSuccess or dnsRcodeNameError, it means the response in msg was not useful and trying another server probably won't help.
If copying result bytes back, the caller should pass the argument frame type as argtype, so that call can execute appropriate write barriers during the copy.
If the error output is long, Stderr may contain only a prefix and suffix of the output, with the middle replaced with text about the number of omitted bytes.
If the original plaintext lengths are not a multiple of the block size, padding would have to be added when encrypting, which would be removed at this point.
In contrast, if any mtime of an input is newer than the mtime of the installed object, a change has occurred since the build, and the build should be redone.
It is okay for different code paths to make different method call sequences on x, but there must be no other source of non-determinism in the call sequences.
It is still used in general, except in checkmark the type bit is repurposed as the checkmark bit and then reinitialized (to 1) as the type bit when finished.
It sets s's sweepgen to the latest generation, and, based on the number of free objects in s, moves s to the appropriate list of c or returns it to the heap.
Like the other syscall_*.go files it is compiled as Go code but also used as input to mksyscall which parses the //sys lines and generates system call stubs.
Otherwise, it returns a meaningful error which is printed by go get, so the user can find why the package wasn't downloaded if the encoding is not supported.
PhaseOption sets the specified flag in the specified ssa phase, returning empty string if this was successful or a string explaining the error if it was not.
StandardUI returns a UI that reads from standard input, prints messages to standard output, prints errors to standard error, and doesn't use auto-completion.
TODO(gri) Method set computation should probably always compute both, the value and the pointer receiver method set and represent them in a single structure.
The 'go test' command rewrites or removes recognized flags, as appropriate, both before and after the optional package list, before invoking the test binary.
The Huffman look-up table requires at least 8 bits for look-up, which means that Huffman decoding can sometimes overshoot and read one or two too many bytes.
The numbers involved must be small (at most 4 digits), have no unnecessary leading zeros, and the version cannot end in .0 - it is go1, not go1.0 or go1.0.0.
The resulting trace is guaranteed to be consistent (for example, a P does not run two Gs at the same time, or a G is indeed blocked before an unblock event).
This is the signal that the span may be used in an MCache, so it must come after the linked list operations above (actually, just after the lock of c above.)
This program compares a pair of trees by walking each in its own goroutine, sending their contents through a channel to a third goroutine that compares them.
This symmetry makes it very easy to change or extend the format: If a new field needs to be encoded, a symmetric change can be made to exporter and importer.
To serve a directory on disk (/tmp) under an alternate URL path (/tmpfiles/), use StripPrefix to modify the request URL's path before the FileServer sees it:
Up to now we extracted the induction variable (ind), the increment delta (inc), the temporary sum (nxt), the mininum value (min) and the maximum value (max).
Use of this source code is governed by a BSD-style license that can be found in the LICENSE file Test that a select statement proceeds when a value is ready.
Using cheapexpr also makes sure that the evaluation of all arguments (and especially any panics) happen before we begin to modify the slice in a visible way.
We can uncomment this when compiler escape analysis is good enough to see that the integer assigned to i does not escape and therefore need not be allocated.
We compare the underlying Object, which checks that the identifier is the one we declared as the receiver for the String method in which this printf appears.
We force all symbol resolution to be done at program startup because lazy PLT resolution can use large amounts of stack at times we cannot allow it to do so.
best maps from the ODCLFUNC of each visited function that recursively invokes a write barrier to the called function on the shortest path to a write barrier.
checkAllocations validates that the profile records collected for the named function are consistent with count contiguous allocations of the specified sizes.
eofc is used to block caller goroutines reading from Response.Body at EOF until this goroutines has (potentially) added the connection back to the idle pool.
manysub_ssa is designed to tickle bugs that depend on register pressure or unfriendly operand ordering in registers (and at least once it succeeded in this).
mapaccess2* returns a typed bool, but due to spec changes, the boolean result of i.(T) is now untyped so we make it the same type as the variable on the lhs.
newBitState returns a new bitState for the given prog, or notBacktrack if the size of the prog exceeds the maximum size that the backtracker will be run for.
or Returns the boolean OR of its arguments by returning the first non-empty argument or the last argument, that is, "or x y" behaves as "if x then x else y".
refahead/refbehind are the regopt variables whose current value may be used in the following/preceding instructions up to a CALL (or the value is clobbered).
representableConst reports whether x can be represented as value of the given basic type and for the configuration provided (only needed for int/uint sizes).
simplify x if the element is a composite literal and its literal type matches the outer literal's element type exactly, the inner literal type may be omitted
stateTransition returns goroutine state (sequence and status) when the event becomes ready for merging (init) and the goroutine state after the event (next).
stkof returns n's offset from SP if n is on the stack (either a local variable or the return value from a function call or the arguments to a function call).
Any names still using the _C syntax are not going to compile, although in general we don't know whether they all made it into the file, so we can't warn here.
Assume that of all the types we saw during the tests, if there wasn't an explicit entry for a conversion between a pair of types, then it's not to be allowed.
By default, the list command prints an error to standard error for each erroneous package and omits the packages from consideration during the usual printing.
By forcing the linkedit section to end on a 16-byte boundary, codesign_allocate will not need to apply any alignment padding itself, working around the issue.
Finally, *Int, *Rat, and *Float satisfy the fmt package's Scanner interface for scanning and (except for *Rat) the Formatter interface for formatted printing.
If SpuriousErrors is not set, the (only) error re- ported for the line is the illegal label error instead of the token before the ':' that caused the problem.
If debug.go is compiled into the program , debugFunc prints a human-readable representation of the gob data read from r by calling that file's Debug function.
If several sigsends and signal_recv execute concurrently, it can lead to unnecessary rechecks of sig.mask, but it cannot lead to missed signals nor deadlocks.
In each 2-bit entry, the lower bit holds the same information as in the 1-bit bitmaps: 0 means uninteresting and 1 means live pointer to be visited during GC.
In runtime, we want to be able to build the package with the go tool, and it assumes these generated files already exist (it does not know how to build them).
It is okay to ignore the return value of any particular call to scanner.state: if one call returns scanError, every subsequent call will return scanError too.
It returns a slice with the contents of the given slice followed by that many bytes and a second slice that aliases into it and contains only the extra bytes.
It returns the number of bytes copied into b, the number of bytes copied into oob, the flags that were set on the packet and the source address of the packet.
NOTE(rsc): It is possible that the ODOT and OINDEX cases are not relevant here, since it shouldn't be possible for them to be involved in an overlapping copy.
RoundTrip must always close the body, including on errors, but depending on the implementation may do so in a separate goroutine even after RoundTrip returns.
Similarly, an empty HLIT tree is guaranteed to fail later since the compressed data section must be composed of at least one symbol (the end-of-block marker).
Special case: len/cap is constant when applied to array or pointer to array when the expression does not contain function calls or channel receive operations.
Such a list is an efficient way to transform a string with repeating elements into one with many small valued numbers, which is suitable for entropy encoding.
TODO(gri) re-examine reexportdeplist: Because we can trivially export types in-place, we don't need to collect types inside function bodies in the exportlist.
Tconv already contains all the necessary logic to generate a representation that completely describes the type, so using it here avoids duplicating that code.
That is, a VARKILL annotation asserts that its argument is certainly dead, for use when the liveness analysis would not otherwise be able to deduce that fact.
The Decompressor itself must be safe to invoke from multiple goroutines simultaneously, but each returned reader will be used only by one goroutine at a time.
The dynamic header is on by default, even without any references to dynamic libraries, because many common system tools now assume the presence of the header.
The exception is ranging over an array value (not a slice, not a pointer to array), which must make a copy to avoid seeing updates made during the range body.
The model is to demonstrate what the reference time looks like so that the Format and Parse methods can apply the same transformation to a general time value.
The test ran correctly most of the time, because the background goroutine had usually read even those extra bits by now, but it's not a useful thing to check.
To be fully precise, there are two results of a compilation: the entire .a file used by the link and the subpiece used by later compilations (__.PKGDEF only).
We currently block at every CGO entry point (via _cgo_wait_runtime_init_done) to ensure that the runtime has been initialized before the CGO call is executed.
When the garbage collector finds an unreachable block with an associated finalizer, it clears the association and runs finalizer(obj) in a separate goroutine.
crosscall1 calls into the runtime to set up the registers the Go runtime expects and so the symbol it calls needs to be exported for external linking to work.
g and f should be the same (rounding by SetPrec after SetInt64 using default precision should be the same as rounding by SetInt64 after setting the precision)
redirect output through a trimmer to eliminate trailing whitespace (Input to a tabwriter must be untrimmed since trailing tabs provide formatting information.
typcheck produced values, this part can declare new vars and so it must be typechecked before body, because body can contain a closure that captures the vars.
(the io.Reader interface's contract promises nothing about the return values of Read calls after an error, yet this package does do multiple Reads after error)
3) If there are no level 4 operators or no level 5 operators, then the cutoff is 6 (always use spaces) in Normal mode and 4 (never use spaces) in Compact mode.
A MetaHeadersFrame is the representation of one HEADERS frame and zero or more contiguous CONTINUATION frames and the decoding of their HPACK-encoded contents.
AMOVL into a register zeros the top of the register, so this is not always necessary, but if we rely on AMOVL the optimizer is almost certain to screw with us.
Also this function must not allocate while holding trace.lock: allocation can call heap allocate, which will try to emit a trace event while holding heap lock.
Because now we know what kind of I/O we are interested in (reading/writing), we can call port_associate passing the correct type of event set (POLLIN/POLLOUT).
Check if compiling the preamble by itself causes any errors, because the messages we've printed out so far aren't helpful to users debugging preamble mistakes.
Check that hogCount and lightCount are within a factor of 2, which indicates that both pairs of goroutines handed off the P within a time-slice to their buddy.
Don't test ScanInts and ScanNumbers since some parts of the floats in the source look like (illegal) octal ints and ScanNumbers may return either Int or Float.
Explicit argument indexes: In Printf, Sprintf, and Fprintf, the default behavior is for each formatting verb to format successive arguments passed in the call.
FindReaderIndex returns a two-element slice of integers defining the location of the leftmost match of the regular expression in text read from the RuneReader.
For example, if the argument is rand.Float64, we must scan both crypto/rand and math/rand to find the symbol, and the first call will return crypto/rand, true.
Generate a distribution of (sign, mantissa, exp) values broader than the float32 range, and check Rat.Float32() always picks the closest float32 approximation.
Generate a distribution of (sign, mantissa, exp) values broader than the float64 range, and check Rat.Float64() always picks the closest float64 approximation.
Gloss over this by reading headers until we encounter a bad one, and then only report a ErrFormat or UnexpectedEOF if the file count modulo 65536 is incorrect.
If an error occurs, read returns the error but also records it, so it is safe for callers to ignore the result as long as delaying the report is not a problem.
If the path is a local import path naming a package that can be imported using a standard import path, the returned package will set p.ImportPath to that path.
If the search tells us that the component number is n, then there was a path from node n+1 back to node n, meaning that the function set is mutually recursive.
If we are using the -n flag (just printing commands) drop the parallelism to 1, both to make the output deterministic and because there is no real work anyway.
If we used the address size annotation to construct the argument list, mark that prefix as implicit: it doesn't need to be shown when printing the instruction.
In effect, the method must look schematically like func (t *T) MethodName(argType T1, replyType *T2) error where T, T1 and T2 can be marshaled by encoding/gob.
Instead, once runtime-integrated network poller tells us that the socket is ready, get the SO_ERROR socket option to see if the connection succeeded or failed.
It is natural to think about including build tags in the build ID, but the naive approach of just dumping the tags into the hash would cause spurious rebuilds.
It returns the number of bytes copied into b, the number of bytes copied into oob, the flags that were set on the packet, and the source address of the packet.
Local means make the symbol local even when compiling Go code to reference Go symbols in other shared libraries, as in this mode symbols are global by default.
MissingMethod returns (nil, false) if V implements T, otherwise it returns a missing method required by T and whether it is missing or just has the wrong type.
NOTE(rsc): I wish we could use the Plan 9 behavior here (only bypass the path if file begins with / or ./ or ../) but that would not match all the Unix shells.
One common implementation strategy is to construct a separate value with a layout corresponding to the desired XML and then to encode it using e.EncodeElement.
Runq emptiness affects scheduling decisions and spurious emptiness can lead to underutilization (both runnable Gs and idle Ps coexist for arbitrary long time).
The functions repeatedly generate a pseudo-random number such that low bits are equal to high bits, swap, check that the old value has low and high bits equal.
The iterative method processes n Words by n divW() calls, each of which visits every Word in the incrementally shortened q for a total of n + (n-1) + (n-2) ...
The key name will be used if it's a non-empty string consisting of only Unicode letters, digits, dollar signs, percent signs, hyphens, underscores and slashes.
The second rule means that a build of a cgo-wrapped library like sqlite3 can generate a standalone executable instead of needing to refer to a dynamic library.
There are two transitions that happen when the 'x' is seen: (1) Transition from a before-value state to a start-of-value state without consuming any character.
This file encapsulates some of the odd characteristics of the 64-bit MIPS (MIPS64) instruction set, to minimize its interaction with the core of the assembler.
This was generated by starting with a the contents of src/pkg/go/parser/parser.go at rev 9b455eb64690, then compressing with bzip2 -9, then encoding to base64.
To generate HTML output, see package html/template, which has the same interface as this package but automatically secures HTML output against certain attacks.
errPhase is used for errors that should not happen unless there is a bug in the JSON decoder or something is editing the data slice while the decoder executes.
indirectToJSONMarshaler returns the value, after dereferencing as many times as necessary to reach the base type (or nil) or an implementation of json.Marshal.
ptr ptr INT ptr ptr ptr ptr INT ptr ptr ptr ptr INT ptr ptr ptr ptr INT ptr ptr ptr ptr INT ptr ptr ptr ptr INT ptr ptr ptr ptr INT ptr ptr ptr ptr INT ptr ptr
typecheckaste was used here but there wasn't enough information further down the call chain to know if we were testing a method receiver for unexported fields.
(nb could be 1.) Since we loaded typ.ptrdata/sys.PtrSize bits but are pretending to have typ.size/sys.PtrSize, there might be no replication necessary/possible.
A fixed-size value is either a fixed-size arithmetic type (int8, uint8, int16, float32, complex64, ...) or an array or struct containing only fixed-size values.
Changing mtime and content of runtime/internal/sys/sys.go should have no effect: we're in a release, which doesn't rebuild for general mtime or content changes.
Each exported struct field becomes a member of the object unless - the field's tag is "-", or - the field is empty and its tag specifies the "omitempty" option.
Ensure that the stores above that initialize x to type-safe memory and set the heap bits occur before the caller can make x observable to the garbage collector.
Every import path should be loaded initially with useVendor, and then the expanded version (with the /vendor/ in it) gets recorded as the canonical import path.
If earlyCloseFn is non-nil and Close is called before io.EOF is seen, earlyCloseFn is called instead of fn, and its return value is the return value from Close.
If the non-Go code installs a signal handler for any of the synchronous signals (SIGBUS, SIGFPE, SIGSEGV), then it should record the existing Go signal handler.
If there is already an attribute with X.509 extensions then the extra extensions should be added to it rather than creating a CSR with two extension attributes.
If, later, Reset or Ignore is called for that signal, or Stop is called on all channels passed to Notify for that signal, the signal will once again be ignored.
Imports are not sorted for nodes representing partial source files (i.e., if the node is not an ast.File or a *printer.CommentedNode not wrapping an *ast.File).
In expected operation, the last m has received the SIGQUIT and run crash/exit and the process is gone, all long before any of the 5-second sleeps have finished.
In order to allow profiling when garbage collection is disabled from the beginning of execution, accumulate stats as if a GC just happened, and recount buckets.
In particular, WriteProxy writes the initial Request-URI line of the request with an absolute URI, per section 5.1.2 of RFC 2616, including the scheme and host.
It does not handle all the non-Latin letters, joiners, and combining marks, but it does handle every codepoint that can occur in a numeric literal or a keyword.
It strips leading common prefixes (like tv_ in tv_sec, tv_usec) converts names to upper case, and rewrites _ into Pad_godefs_n, so that all fields are exported.
It uses statistics gathered by the garbage collector to perform enough sweeping so that all pages are swept during the concurrent sweep phase between GC cycles.
It would also exacerbate the problems mentioned earlier, since even programs that are careful to maintain mtimes on files rarely maintain mtimes on directories.
Merge temps with non-overlapping lifetimes and equal types using the greedy algorithm in Poletto and Sarkar, "Linear Scan Register Allocation", ACM TOPLAS 1999.
NOTE(foo): 1 of 4 - this is the first line of note 1 - note 1 continues on this 2nd line - note 1 continues on this 3rd line NOTE(foo): 2 of 4 NOTE(bar): 3 of 4
Non-constant untyped values may appear as the result of comparisons (untyped bool), intermediate (delayed-checked) rhs operands of shifts, and as the value nil.
Note: Could use filepath.Walk instead of walkDirs but that wouldn't necessarily be shorter or clearer after adding the code to terminate early for -short tests.
Otherwise, the import path P denotes the package found in the directory DIR/src/P for some DIR listed in the GOPATH environment variable (see 'go help gopath').
Signed/unsigned is explicit with the extension ops (SignExt*/ZeroExt*) and implicit as the arg to some opcodes (e.g. the second argument to shifts is unsigned).
Some system calls that create new file descriptors can block for arbitrarily long times: open on a hung NFS server or named pipe, accept on a socket, and so on.
Something went wrong in the trailer, we must not allow any further reads of any kind to succeed from body, nor any subsequent requests on the server connection.
StartCPUProfile relies on the SIGPROF signal, but that signal will be delivered to the main program's SIGPROF signal handler (if any) not to the one used by Go.
The 2-bit entries are split when written into the byte, so that the top half of the byte contains 4 high bits and the bottom half contains 4 low (pointer) bits.
The allocBits indicate which unmarked objects don't need to be processed since they were free at the end of the last GC cycle and were not allocated since then.
The lhs is representable as an integer but may not be an integer (e.g., 2.0, an untyped float) - this can only happen for untyped non-integer numeric constants.
The methods on heapBits take value receivers so that the compiler can more easily inline calls to those methods and registerize the struct fields independently.
The outer function's stack may have moved during gcMark (it shrinks stacks, including the outer function's stack), so we must not refer to any of its variables.
This differs from CSS3's wc production because it contains a probable spec error whereby wc contains all the single byte sequences in nl (newline) but not CRLF.
This is due to the fact that IPv4 traffic will not be routed to an IPv6 socket - two separate sockets are required if both address families are to be supported.
Unfortunately, a simultaneous call to adb shell hold open file descriptors, so it is necessary to push then move to avoid a "text file busy" error on execution.
When doing this we must keep track of what kind of events the goroutines are currently interested in, for example a fd may be open both for reading and writing.
_cgo_Cfunc_f invokes the actual C function f with arguments taken from the frame structure, records the results in the frame, and returns to runtime.asmcgocall.
decode is like Decode but returns an additional 'end' value, which indicates if end-of-message padding was encountered and thus any additional data is an error.
for go:linkname Supply environ, __progname and __guard_local, because we don't link against the standard OpenBSD crt0.o and the libc dynamic library needs them.
idiomaticRedecl reports whether this declaration spec can be ignored for the purposes of shadowing, that is, that any redeclarations it contains are deliberate.
labeled statements put labels on a separate line, but here we only care about the start line of the actual statement without label - correct line for each label
services contains minimal mappings between services names and port numbers for platforms that don't have a complete list of port numbers (some Solaris distros).
An appropriate use of a Pool is to manage a group of temporary items silently shared among and potentially reused by concurrent independent clients of a package.
BuildNameToCertificate parses c.Certificates and builds c.NameToCertificate from the CommonName and SubjectAlternateName fields of each of the leaf certificates.
Building an executable that imports both explicit and implicit builds the code from implicit into the executable rather than fetching it from the shared library.
Calling Read on special types like TypeLink, TypeSymLink, TypeChar, TypeBlock, TypeDir, and TypeFifo returns 0, io.EOF regardless of what the Header.Size claims.
Currently, the reader code doesn't verify the fileheader and TOC's crc32 match if they're both non-zero and only the second line above, the TOC, is what matters.
ERROR "import statement" Each of these pairs tests both `` vs "" strings and also use of invalid characters spelled out as escape sequences and written directly.
For more information about the formats and the definition of the reference time, see the documentation for ANSIC and the other constants defined by this package.
For those, the linker stores the build ID as non-instruction bytes at the very beginning of the text segment, which should appear near the beginning of the file.
However, in the case where the called function was one of these wrappers, the rewritten receiver is almost certainly a different type than the original receiver.
If https://codereview.appspot.com/169040043 is submitted, and this test is changed to pass -complete to the compiler, then we can uncomment the copy lines again.
If keys and values have no pointers, the map implementation can keep a list of overflow pointers on the side so that buckets can be marked as having no pointers.
It is an error if a resulting template is non-empty (contains content other than template definitions) and would replace a non-empty template with the same name.
Matching is imprecise (as reflect.Type can be used through a custom interface), so ReflectMethod may be set in some cases when the reflect package is not called.
NOTE(rsc): This function does NOT call the runtime cmpstring function, because we do not want to provide any performance justification for using strings.Compare.
Note that the first and last line are never empty (they contain the opening /* and closing */ respectively) and thus they can be ignored by the blank line check.
Otherwise it refills the cache with a span with an available object and returns that object along with a flag indicating that this was a heavy weight allocation.
Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from it.
Programs that use Contexts should follow these rules to keep interfaces consistent across packages and enable static analysis tools to check context propagation:
SetCgoTraceback records three C functions to use to gather traceback information from C code and to convert that traceback information into symbolic information.
SetFinalizer has a special case for objects potentially coming from tiny allocator, it such case it allows to set finalizers for an inner byte of a memory block.
SetTraceback sets the amount of detail printed by the runtime in the traceback it prints before exiting due to an unrecovered panic or an internal runtime error.
SkipSpace provides Scan methods the ability to skip space and newline characters in keeping with the current scanning mode set by format strings and Scan/Scanln.
The Go linker does not currently know how to handle TLS relocations, hence we have to force external linking for any libraries that link in code that uses errno.
The default output prints one line per symbol, with three space-separated fields giving the address (in hexadecimal), type (a character), and name of the symbol.
The ideal interface would be to pass typecheck a map from importpath to package API text (Go source code), but for now we use data structures (TypeConfig, Type).
The race detector doesn't know that we're waiting for a timeout and thinks that the waitgroup inside httptest.Server is added to concurrently with us closing it.
The spec says: "Although not originally assigned a signature, the value 0x08074b50 has commonly been adopted as a signature value for the data descriptor record.
There are four special operations available for type Pointer that are not available for other types: - A pointer value of any type can be converted to a Pointer.
This file encapsulates some of the odd characteristics of the 64-bit PowerPC (PPC64) instruction set, to minimize its interaction with the core of the assembler.
This is necessary because a sigprof during barrier installation or removal could observe inconsistencies between the stkbar array and the stack itself and crash.
To avoid requesting more OS memory while there are unswept spans, when a goroutine needs another span, it first attempts to reclaim that much memory by sweeping.
Unfortunately, we don't know what to put in the host name section to get the client to connect to us again, so we can't know the right absolute URI to send back.
W.Hormann, G.Derflinger: "Rejection-Inversion to Generate Variates from Monotone Discrete Distributions" http://eeyore.wu-wien.ac.at/papers/96-04-04.wh-der.ps.gz
We may receive another instance of the signal before we restore the Go handler, but that is not so bad: we know that the Go program has been ignoring the signal.
Writing assembly test cases to divine which interpretation the CPU uses might clarify the situation, but more likely it would make the situation even less clear.
chapter 10 proposes an alternative sequence of instructions for architectures (TODO: MIPS64, PPC64, S390X) that do not have a shift right with carry instruction.
gcCreditSlack is the amount of scan work credit that can can accumulate locally before updating gcController.scanWork and, optionally, gcController.bgScanCredit.
impatientInsecureHTTPClient is used in -insecure mode, when we're connecting to https servers that might not be there or might be using self-signed certificates.
spec: "The scope of a type identifier declared inside a function begins at the identifier in the TypeSpec and ends at the end of the innermost containing block."
A generated method with a return value large enough to be initialized by duffzero is not a leaf method, which violated assumptions made by cmd/internal/obj/ppc64.
A year has 53 weeks when Jan 1 or Dec 31 is a Thursday, meaning Jan 1 of the next year is a Friday or it was a leap year and Jan 1 of the next year is a Saturday.
Close indicates whether to close the connection after replying to this request (for servers) or after sending this request and reading its response (for clients).
DataErrReader wraps a Reader and changes its behavior so the final error is returned along with the final data, instead of in the first call after the final data.
Each of these extra m's also has a g0 and a curg that are pressed into service as the scheduling stack and current goroutine for the duration of the cgo callback.
ErrorDetail is not guaranteed to return a non-nil value and like the rest of the http2 package, its return value is not protected by an API compatibility promise.
FoldCategory maps a category name to a table of code points outside the category that are equivalent under simple case folding to code points inside the category.
For normal packages the compiler doesn't even record the lower case functions in its symbol table, but some functions in runtime are hard-coded into the compiler.
For strings, byte slices and byte arrays, however, precision limits the length of the input to be formatted (not the size of the output), truncating if necessary.
For the concurrent garbage collector, the Go compiler implements updates to pointer-valued fields that may be in heap objects by emitting calls to write barriers.
Go spec: The scope of a type identifier declared inside a function begins at the identifier in the TypeSpec and ends at the end of the innermost containing block.
Hence, we opt for forcing the re-scan to scan the frame containing p, which we can do by simply unwinding the stack barriers between the current SP and p's frame.
If content is large, an alternative to setting Content is to set File, which names a file in the testdata/ directory containing the uncompressed expected content.
If enabled (the default), the Reader expects the input to be a sequence of individually gzipped data streams, each with its own header and trailer, ending at EOF.
If it was a read error (because the child died itself), then the extra kill of an already-dead process is harmless (the PID won't be reused until the Wait above).
In either case, the plaintext is returned in em so that it may be read independently of whether it was valid in order to maintain constant memory access patterns.
In other words, given var once Once if once.Do(f) is called multiple times, only the first call will invoke f, even if f has a different value in each invocation.
In theory all the commands we invoke should have the same default computation of these as we do, but in practice there might be skew This makes sure we all agree.
LoadLibraryEx is not available on old Windows, though, and the LOAD_LIBRARY_SEARCH_* flags are not available on some versions of Windows without a security patch.
Malloc block sizes d are always even, so the first shift implements the factors of 2 in d and then the mul and second shift implement the odd factor that remains.
MapType     23 Finally, each message created by a call to Encode is preceded by an encoded unsigned integer count of the number of bytes remaining in the message.
NOTE: Unlike switch and type switch below, we don't care whether a select has a default, because a select without a default blocks until one of the cases can run.
Non-literal codes decode to a sequence of suffixes that are first written right-to-left from the end of the buffer before being copied to the start of the buffer.
Normally we'd do syscall.SetsockoptInt(fd.sysfd, syscall.IPPROTO_TCP, syscall.TCP_KEEPINTVL, secs) here, but we can't because Solaris does not have TCP_KEEPINTVL.
Output: Input: "the go programming language" Output 0: The Go Programming Language Output 1: "The Go Programming Language" Output 2: "The Go Programming Language"
ReplaceAllFunc returns a copy of src in which all matches of the Regexp have been replaced by the return value of function repl applied to the matched byte slice.
StatusCode ProtoMajor ProtoMinor Request.Method TransferEncoding Trailer Body ContentLength Header, values for non-canonical keys will have unpredictable behavior
Strictly speaking, the rebuild is only necessary if the modifications to p change its export metadata, but determining that is a bit tricky, so we rebuild always.
Such characters include letters, marks, numbers, punctuation, symbols, and the ASCII space character, from categories L, M, N, P, S and the ASCII space character.
The gccgo compiler had a bug: mentioning a function type in an expression in a function literal messed up the list of variables referenced in enclosing functions.
The parser accepts a larger language than is syntactically permitted by the Go spec, for simplicity, and for improved robustness in the presence of syntax errors.
The request parser implements this by using CanonicalHeaderKey, making the first character and any characters following a hyphen uppercase and the rest lowercase.
They need to use incref/decref to ensure that they operate on the correct fd in presence of a concurrent close call (otherwise fd can be closed under their feet).
This example demonstrates how to use big.Rat to compute the first 15 terms in the sequence of rational convergents for the constant e (base of natural logarithm).
This is here to work around a bug where we generate negative operands that match C_MOVCON, but we use them with instructions that only accept unsigned immediates.
This makes it possible to see call sites for duffcopy/duffzero in BP-based profiling tools like Linux perf (which is the whole point of obj.Framepointer_enabled).
Two struct types are identical if they have the same sequence of fields, and if corresponding fields have the same names, and identical types, and identical tags.
Unlike gcDrain, there's no need to flush remaining work here because this never flushes to bgScanCredit and gcw.dispose will flush any remaining work to scanWork.
Using a stride other than 1 is meant to visit the instructions in a pseudorandom order, which gives better variety in the set of test cases chosen by -printtests.
Walk the dominator tree from end to beginning, just once, treating SCC components as single blocks, duplicated calculated liveness information out to all of them.
We cannot safely move the stack during an active call to syscall, because we do not know which of the uintptr arguments are really pointers (back into the stack).
We define two kinds of phis, those where the merge happens in a register (a "register" phi) and those where the merge happens in a stack location (a "stack" phi).
We only need a wrapper to support static functions in the prologue--without a wrapper, we can't refer to the function, since the reference is in a different file.
When -shared is passed, we leave the code in the 2-instruction form but assemble (and relocate) them in different ways to generate the initial exec code sequence.
b is the profile bytes after the header, period is the profiling period, and parse is a function to parse 8-byte chunks from the profile in its native endianness.
cgoMmap calls the mmap function in the runtime/cgo package on the callCgoMmap calls the mmap function in the runtime/cgo package using the GCC calling convention.
commentBefore reports whether the current comment group occurs before the next position in the source code and printing it does not introduce implicit semicolons.
createEnvBlock converts an array of environment strings into the representation required by CreateProcess: a sequence of NUL terminated strings followed by a nil.
go:cgo_export_dynamic environ environ go:cgo_export_dynamic __progname __progname This is normally marked as hidden and placed in the .openbsd.randomdata section.
go:cgo_import_dynamic _ _ "libsendfile.so" go:cgo_import_dynamic _ _ "libsocket.so" maxSendfileSize is the largest chunk size we ask the kernel to copy at a time.
go:cgo_import_static x_cgo_sys_thread_create go:linkname x_cgo_sys_thread_create x_cgo_sys_thread_create go:linkname _cgo_sys_thread_create _cgo_sys_thread_create
lines are broken using newlines so comments remain aligned unless forceFF is set or there are multiple expressions on the same line in which case formfeed is used
linesFrom returns the number of output lines between the current output line and the line argument, ignoring any pending (not yet emitted) whitespace or comments.
lookupName returns information about the time zone with the given name (such as "EST") at the given pseudo-Unix time (what the given time of day would be in UTC).
p.To.Type was set to TYPE_BRANCH above, but that makes checkaddr in ../pass.go complain, so set it back to TYPE_MEM here, until p2 itself gets passed to progedit.
readMetaFrame returns 0 or more CONTINUATION frames from fr and merge them into into the provided hf and returns a MetaHeadersFrame with the decoded hpack values.
stripCommonPrefix removes a common prefix from /*-style comment lines (unless no comment line is indented, all but the first line have some form of space prefix).
traceBufs are not allocated from the GC'd heap, so this is safe, and are often manipulated in contexts where write barriers are not allowed, so this is necessary.
unevaluated index arguments load computes src into targ, but if src refers to the len or cap of n.Left, load copies those from xlen, xcap, loading xlen if needed.
A command is a simple value (argument) or a function or method call, possibly with multiple arguments: Argument The result is the value of evaluating the argument.
After the last value has been received from a closed channel c, any receive from c will succeed without blocking, returning the zero value for the channel element.
All multiword objects are 2-word aligned, so we know that the initial word's 2-bit pair and the second word's 2-bit pair are in the same heap bitmap byte, *h.bitp.
Cannot remove VARDEF instruction, because - unlike TYPE handled above - VARDEFs are interspersed with other code, and a jump might be using the VARDEF as a target.
Example functions may include a concluding line comment that begins with "Output:" and is compared with the standard output of the function when the tests are run.
Furthermore if either white object dies before it is reached by the GC then the object can be collected during this GC cycle instead of waiting for the next cycle.
GCM has two modes of operation with respect to the initial counter state: a "fast path" for 96-bit (12-byte) nonces, and a "slow path" for nonces of other lengths.
Go programs that use cgo or SWIG In a Go program that includes non-Go code, typically C/C++ code accessed using cgo or SWIG, Go's startup code normally runs first.
Gs, Ms, and Ps are always reachable via true pointers in the allgs, allm, and allp lists or (during allocation before they reach those lists) from stack variables.
If the string appears to be well-formed but incomplete (i.e., to get the whole Rune we'd need to read past str+length) then we'll set the Rune to Bad and return 0.
In a concurrent garbage collector, one worries about failing to mark a live object due to mutations without write barriers or bugs in the collector implementation.
It is based on the draft JavaScript 2.0 lexical grammar and requires one token of lookbehind: http://www.mozilla.org/js/language/js20-2000-07/rationale/syntax.html
It's possible for a mutator to modify the stack above the lowest un-hit stack barrier if a higher frame has passed down a pointer to a stack variable in its frame.
LineEntries occur in order of increasing PC and each LineEntry gives metadata for the instructions from that LineEntry's PC to just before the next LineEntry's PC.
Output is hardwired to DX only, and DX contains the closure pointer on closure entry, and this "instruction" is scheduled to the very beginning of the entry block.
Perhaps the test should be more explicit and use a HEAD, but tests elsewhere guarantee that zero byte responses generate a "Content-Length: 0" instead of chunking.
Readdir reads the contents of the directory associated with file and returns a slice of up to n FileInfo values, as would be returned by Lstat, in directory order.
TestCMYKToRGBConsistency tests that calling the RGBA method (16 bit color) then truncating to 8 bits is equivalent to calling the CMYKToRGB function (8 bit color).
TestFloatRound24 tests that rounding a float64 to 24 bits matches IEEE-754 rounding to nearest when converting a float64 to a float32 (excluding denormal numbers).
That is, any released version of this package should be able to decode data written with any previously released version, subject to issues such as security fixes.
The following flags are recognized by the 'go test' command and control the execution of any test: -bench regexp Run (sub)benchmarks matching a regular expression.
The generated files contain type information about the symbols exported by the package and about types used by symbols imported by the package from other packages.
The goroutine interacts with the signal handler by calling getprofile() to get the next log piece to write, implicitly handing back the last log piece it obtained.
The other quirk with FreeBSD's sendfile implementation is that it doesn't use the current position of the file -- if you pass it offset 0, it starts from offset 0.
The other quirk with Solaris's sendfile implementation is that it doesn't use the current position of the file -- if you pass it offset 0, it starts from offset 0.
The package's Imports list must include all packages explicitly imported by exports.go, plus all packages referenced indirectly via exported objects in exports.go.
The stack bounds check detects the partial transition here, and (again) signal handlers run with signals disabled, so a profiling signal cannot arrive then anyway.
The whole request body is parsed and up to a total of maxMemory bytes of its file parts are stored in memory, with the remainder stored on disk in temporary files.
There is one exception for performance and complexity reasons: hitting a stack barrier manipulates the stack barrier list without acquiring the stack barrier lock.
These failures happen for several reasons beyond our control, but all of them are safe to retry as they happen before lldb encounters the initial getwd breakpoint.
They are both technically valid characters in JSON strings, but don't work in JSONP, which has to be evaluated as JavaScript, and can lead to security holes there.
This will patch up the .plt slot to point directly at the function so future calls go straight from the call stub to the real function, and then call the function.
Usual reason is that we've merged memory from two different VirtualAlloc calls, and Windows will only let each VirtualFree handle pages from a single VirtualAlloc.
We treat this as a read operation, so we allow it even for unexported data, because the caller has to import "unsafe" to turn it into something that can be abused.
When the function is invoked, reflect turns the arguments into Values, calls swap, and then turns swap's result slice into the values returned by the new function.
conditions array record the required CPSR cond field for the first 5 pairs of conditional execution opcodes higher 4 bits are must set, lower 4 bits are must clear
crosscall_ppc64 calls into the runtime to set up the registers the Go runtime expects and so the symbol it calls needs to be exported for external linking to work.
delayed checks requiring fully setup types context within which the current object is type-checked (valid only for the duration of type-checking a specific object)
detect shells out to ideviceinfo, a third party program that can be obtained by following the instructions at https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libimobiledevice.
golang.org/issue/4741 -- setting only a write timeout that triggers shouldn't cause a handler to block forever on reads (next HTTP request) that will never happen.
iota is a predeclared identifier representing the untyped integer ordinal number of the current const specification in a (usually parenthesized) const declaration.
jsRegexpEscaper behaves like jsStrEscaper but escapes regular expression specials so the result is treated literally when included in a regular expression literal.
list of free stacks, avoids overloading freelist freeindex is the slot index between 0 and nelems at which to begin scanning for the next free object in this span.
AppendQuoteRuneToASCII appends a single-quoted Go character literal representing the rune, as generated by QuoteRuneToASCII, to dst and returns the extended buffer.
Because compilation units can describe multiple regions of the executable, in the worst case SeekPC must search through all the ranges in all the compilation units.
DialIP connects to the remote address raddr on the network protocol netProto, which must be "ip", "ip4", or "ip6" followed by a colon and a protocol number or name.
Doing that could be an interesting test case for go/typechecker: the constraints about working with partial information will likely exercise it in interesting ways.
Even if the child were to close the fd explicitly, it would still be open from the time of the fork until the time of the explicit close, and the race would remain.
FindPkg returns the filename and unique package id for an import path based on package information provided by build.Import (using the build.Default build.Context).
Floats are tricky because you want to scan in the precision of the result, not scan in high precision and convert, in order to preserve the correct error condition.
For example, a float64 with value 300 or a string with value "300" can scan into a uint16, but not into a uint8, though float64(255) or "255" can scan into a uint8.
For example, the first function, cvtInt, takes any value v of signed int type and returns the value converted to type t, where t is any signed or unsigned int type.
Holds variables parsed from GODEBUG env var, except for "memprofilerate" since there is an existing int var for that value, which may already have an initial value.
IF GOSSAHASH is a suffix of the binary-rendered SHA1 hash of the function name THEN compile this function with SSA ELSE compile this function with the old back end.
If More is set non-zero, the function will be called again with the same PC, and may return different information (this is intended for use with inlined functions).
If the output clobbers the input register, make sure we have at least two copies of the input register so we don't have to reload the value from the spill location.
If the token positions are invalid due to parse errors, the resulting end position may be past the file's EOF position, which would lead to panics if used later on.
In either form, the information is used by the runtime to initialize the heap bitmap, and for large types (like 128 or more words), they are roughly the same speed.
IsPrint reports whether the rune is defined as printable by Go, with the same definition as unicode.IsPrint: letters, numbers, punctuation, symbols and ASCII space.
It would be nice to catch the problem sooner, but there is no reliable way to guarantee that timerproc schedules without doing something involving timerproc itself.
NOTE: sysAlloc returns OS-aligned memory, but the heap allocator may use larger alignment, so the caller must be careful to realign the memory obtained by sysAlloc.
Note that obj.Parent() may be different from the returned scope if the object was inserted into the scope and already had a parent at that time (see Insert, below).
Package context defines the Context type, which carries deadlines, cancelation signals, and other request-scoped values across API boundaries and between processes.
Programs that change the memory profiling rate should do so just once, as early as possible in the execution of the program (for example, at the beginning of main).
Since the templates created by ParseFiles are named by the base names of the argument files, t should usually have the name of one of the (base) names of the files.
Size returns how many bytes Write would generate to encode the value v, which must be a fixed-size value or a slice of fixed-size values, or a pointer to such data.
The GIF89a spec, Section 20 (Image Descriptor) says: "Each image must fit within the boundaries of the Logical Screen, as defined in the Logical Screen Descriptor."
The argument boolean, if true, suppresses the output if the user's argument is identical to the actual package path or is empty, meaning it's the current directory.
The run-length encoding works like this: Any sequence of four equal bytes is followed by a length byte which contains the number of repeats of that byte to include.
This function takes care to associate the descriptor only with the subset of events that were previously part of the association, except the one that just happened.
This is necessary for shared libraries where we kickoff runtime initialization in a separate thread and return without waiting for this thread to complete the init.
This test intends to test that sending SIGPROF to foreign threads before we make any cgo call will not abort the whole process, so we cannot make any cgo call here.
This thread is going to run a goroutine and is not spinning anymore, so if it was marked as spinning we need to reset it now and potentially start a new spinning M.
Vendor Directories Go 1.6 includes support for using local copies of external dependencies to satisfy imports of those dependencies, often referred to as vendoring.
canSend is a slice of memory that's reused between frame scheduling decisions to hold the list of writeQueues (from sq) which have enough flow control data to send.
connStmt returns a free driver connection on which to execute the statement, a function to call to release the connection, and a statement bound to that connection.
don't emit pos info for builtin packages (not needed and avoids path name diffs in builtin.go between Windows and non-Windows machines, exposed via builtin_test.go)
done, if non-nil, must be a buffered channel with space for 1 message and is sent the return value from write (or an earlier error) when the frame has been written.
fmtB appends the string of x in the format mantissa "p" exponent with a decimal mantissa and a binary exponent, or 0" if x is zero, and returns the extended buffer.
getUniversalType returns the tag for PrintableString when it sees a string, so if we see a different string type on the wire, we change the universal type to match.
if this is not the last unindent, apply it as it is (likely) belonging to the last construct (e.g., a multi-line expression list) and is not part of closing a block
keysFromMasterSecret generates the connection keys from the master secret, given the lengths of the MAC key, cipher key and IV, as defined in RFC 2246, section 6.3.
length of a board row (+1 for newline) The board must be surrounded by 2 illegal fields in each direction so that move() doesn't need to check the board boundaries.
numLiterals  The number of literals specified in codegen numOffsets   The number of offsets specified in codegen numCodegens  The number of codegens used in codegen
x.typ is typed spec: "If a left-hand side is the blank identifier, any typed or non-constant value except for the predeclared identifier nil may be assigned to it."
(3) The common use of "go install -a ./..." led to reports of problems when the -a forced the rebuild of the standard library, which for some users was not writable.
(If a change to a release tree must be made by hand, the way to force the install is to run make.bash, which will remove the old package archives before rebuilding.)
AddDate normalizes its result in the same way that Date does, so, for example, adding one month to October 31 yields December 1, the normalized form for November 31.
Constraints may appear in any kind of source file (not just Go), but they must appear near the top of the file, preceded only by blank lines and other line comments.
Harder case: increment waiter count try cansemacquire one more time, return if succeeded enqueue itself as a waiter sleep (waiter descriptor is dequeued by signaler)
Hence, there must be a store/store barrier here to ensure the writes to h_spans above happen before the caller can publish a pointer p to an object allocated from s.
However, it's critical to note that ciphertexts must be authenticated (i.e. by using crypto/hmac) before being decrypted in order to avoid creating a padding oracle.
If the next token is token.CHAN we still don't know if it is a channel type or a receive operation - we only know once we have found the end of the unary expression.
If x and y are not equal, the type will be invalid (have a negative array count) and an inscrutable error will come out of the compiler and hopefully mention "name".
In (4), we should URL escape for URL attributes, and for others we have the attribute name available if our conservative assumption proves problematic for real code.
Installing stack barriers forces the G to a safe point, while all other operations that modify stack barriers run on the G and prevent it from reaching a safe point.
It uses a close-on-exec file descriptor itself to determine this, so we know that when cmd.Start returns, at least one close-on-exec file descriptor has been closed.
Level -2 (HuffmanOnly) will use Huffman compression only, giving a very fast compression for all types of input, but sacrificing considerable compression efficiency.
Now they are more like standard object files, in that each symbol is defined by an associated memory image (bytes) and a list of relocations to apply during linking.
Objects exported in phase 1 (compiler-indendepent objects) are by definition only the objects from the current package and not pulled in via inlined function bodies.
Receivers should be careful to use Equal to compare MACs in order to avoid timing side-channels: CheckMAC reports whether messageMAC is a valid HMAC tag for message.
Since this code (selfConnect) is already trying to work around a problem, we make sure if this happens we recognize trouble and ask the DialTCP routine to try again.
Small allocation sizes (up to and including 32 kB) are rounded to one of about 100 size classes, each of which has its own free list of objects of exactly that size.
String returns the serialization of the cookie for use in a Cookie header (if only Name and Value are set) or a Set-Cookie response header (if other fields are set).
TestYCbCrToRGBConsistency tests that calling the RGBA method (16 bit color) then truncating to 8 bits is equivalent to calling the YCbCrToRGB function (8 bit color).
The UTF-8 sequence for a codepoint is never longer than 1 + the number hex digits need to represent that codepoint, so len(s) is an upper bound on the output length.
The all.bash installation script sets it to make installation more efficient, but by default the flag is off so a plain "go test" will do a full test of the package.
The cached value is a uint32 in which the low bits are the "crash" and "all" settings and the remaining bits are the traceback value (0 off, 1 on, 2 include system).
The diff shows common lines prefixed by a tab, lines present only in haveText prefixed by "unexpected: ", and lines present only in wantText prefixed by "missing: ".
The encoding handles 4-byte chunks, using a special encoding for the last fragment, so Encode is not appropriate for use on individual blocks of a large data stream.
The only way we can get here is if we are in a library or archive, we installed a signal handler at program startup, but the Go runtime has not yet been initialized.
The other quirk with DragonFly's sendfile implementation is that it doesn't use the current position of the file -- if you pass it offset 0, it starts from offset 0.
The rounding mode specifies how a result should be rounded to fit into the mantissa bits, and accuracy describes the rounding error with respect to the exact result.
The spec (section 11.2.3) says that "any out-of-range pixel value found in the image data is an error", but some real-world PNG files have out-of-range pixel values.
The upper bits of m.locked record the nesting depth of calls to lockOSThread (counting up by LockInternal), popped by unlockOSThread (counting down by LockInternal).
They must be enabled for writes to higher stack frames before we scan stacks and install stack barriers because this is how we track writes to inactive stack frames.
This is a standard CRC32 like in hash/crc32 except that all the shifts are reversed, causing the bits in the input to be processed in the reverse of the usual order.
This is a torture test for an old implementation of recover that tried to deal with wrapper functions by doing some argument positioning math on both entry and exit.
To determine whether the flags are available, use GetProcAddress to get the address of the AddDllDirectory, RemoveDllDirectory, or SetDefaultDllDirectories function.
We treat these as requiring eager writes to memory, due to the possibility of a fault handler looking at them, so there is not much point in registerizing the loads.
Windows CreateProcess assumes the opposite: it looks for argv0 relative to the current directory, and, only once the new process is started, it does Chdir(attr.Dir).
compiler to assume when computing target paths The build and release tags specify build constraints that should be considered satisfied when processing +build lines.
initfix computes initialization order for a list l of top-level declarations and outputs the corresponding list of statements to include in the init() function body.
newlines affect the current state (p.impliedSemi) and not the state after printing arg (impliedSemi) because comments can be interspersed before the arg in this case
treat recv.meth as a value with recv in it, only happens in ODEFER and OPROC iface.method already leaks iface in esccall, no need to put in extra ODOTINTER edge here
(The netgo tag controls whether package net uses cgo or pure Go for functionality such as name resolution.) Using the installed non-netgo package defeats the purpose.
(We could also require that SP be changed only after g, but the stack bounds check is needed by other cases, so there is no need to impose an additional requirement.)
A value is addressable if it is an element of a slice, an element of an addressable array, a field of an addressable struct, or the result of dereferencing a pointer.
An import path is a pattern if it includes one or more "..." wildcards, each of which can match any string, including the empty string and strings containing slashes.
ArgsSizeUnknown is set in Func.argsize to mark all functions whose argument size is unknown (C vararg functions, and assembly code without an explicit specification).
Changing the value of the element at index i and then calling Fix is equivalent to, but less expensive than, calling Remove(h, i) followed by a Push of the new value.
Connection Name:  Bluetooth Network Connection Network Adapter:  Bluetooth Device (Personal Area Network) Physical Address: N/A Transport Name:   Hardware not present
Connection Name:  VMware Network Adapter VMnet8 Network Adapter:  VMware Virtual Ethernet Adapter for VMnet8 Physical Address: Disabled Transport Name:   Disconnected
Do not allow access to unexported values via Interface, because they might be pointers that should not be writable or methods or function that should not be callable.
First, you can actually run 'go test' in directories that have names that Windows thinks are installer-like, without getting a dialog box asking for more permissions.
Functions that wish to store values in Context typically allocate a key in a global variable then use that key as the argument to context.WithValue and Context.Value.
If a comment is between the line break and the label, the unindent is not part of the comment whitespace prefix and the comment will be positioned correctly indented.
If exactly one exists, it will be returned in *save (if save is not nil), and dotlist will contain the path of embedded fields traversed to find it, in reverse order.
If the Header does not contain a Content-Type line, Write adds a Content-Type set to the result of passing the initial 512 bytes of written data to DetectContentType.
If they can do that then they can learn whether a random value was used (because it'll be different for the same ciphertext) and thus whether the padding was correct.
ImportData imports a package by reading the gc-generated export data, adds the corresponding package object to the packages map indexed by id, and returns the object.
In no event shall the copyright-holder be liable for any incidental, punitive, or consequential damages of any kind whatsoever arising from the use of these programs.
In package runtime, there is only one call that copies results back, in cgocallbackg1, and it does NOT pass a frame type, meaning there are no write barriers invoked.
It applies the same rules that are used with context tags in package go/build, except that the GOOS and GOARCH can appear anywhere in the file name, not just after _.
It is fundamental for slice/string/interface: the garbage collector needs the whole value, not just some of the words, in order to interpret the other bits correctly.
It is intended to be returned by a Split function to indicate that the token being delivered with the error is the last token and scanning should stop after this one.
NOTE: SysReserve returns OS-aligned memory, but the heap allocator may use larger alignment, so the caller must be careful to realign the memory obtained by sysAlloc.
Not sure yet whether this is the real iota, but make a copy of the Node* just in case, so that all the copies of this const definition don't have the same iota value.
Open decrypts and authenticates ciphertext, authenticates the additional data and, if successful, appends the resulting plaintext to dst, returning the updated slice.
ResponseHeaderTimeout, if non-zero, specifies the amount of time to wait for a server's response headers after fully writing the request (including its body, if any).
Scale minimum by 100 to use larger units, allowing minimum value to be scaled down to 0.01, except for callgrind reports since they can only represent integer values.
Single quote and parens are sub-delims in RFC 3986, but we escape them so the output can be embedded in single quoted attributes and unquoted CSS url(...) constructs.
The RGB to CMY inversion cancels out the 'Adobe inversion' described in the applyBlack doc comment above, so in practice, only the fourth channel (black) is inverted.
The default HTTP client's Transport does not attempt to reuse HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/1.1 TCP connections ("keep-alive") unless the Body is read to completion and is closed.
The dynamic linker stores the address of the dynamic resolver and the DSO identifier in the two doublewords at the beginning of the .plt section before the PLT array.
The first sunk spill will be the original, but moved, to an exit block, thus ensuring that there is a definition somewhere corresponding to the original spill's uses.
The items documented here are not actually in package builtin but their descriptions here allow godoc to present documentation for the language's special identifiers.
Think of them as a way to implement sleep and wakeup such that every sleep is paired with a single wakeup, even if, due to races, the wakeup happens before the sleep.
This file tests that when cgo -godefs sees a struct with a field that is an anonymous union, the first field in the union is promoted to become a field of the struct.
This is legal in general, but if we make the tests clean up their statements first, then we can safely verify this is always zero here, and any other value is a leak.
This will just cause steals to fail until credit is accumulated again, so in the long run it doesn't really matter, but we do have to handle the negative credit case.
To keep the leak checker happy, keep track of pending dials and wait for them to finish (and be closed or returned to the idle pool) before we close idle connections.
Unmarshal maps an XML element or attribute value to an integer or floating-point field by setting the field to the result of interpreting the string value in decimal.
When the execution path branches on the condition `v op w` the set of relations is updated to exclude any relation not possible due to `v op w` being true (or false).
an integer constant we can use as an immediate is simpler than a variable - we can use the immediate in the adjustment instruction directly - so it goes on the right.
idiomaticShortRedecl reports whether this short declaration can be ignored for the purposes of shadowing, that is, that any redeclarations it contains are deliberate.
maxBadConnRetries is the number of maximum retries if the driver returns driver.ErrBadConn to signal a broken connection before forcing a new connection to be opened.
mustBeAssignable panics if f records that the value is not assignable, which is to say that either it was obtained using an unexported field or it is not addressable.
numberBlock assigns entry and exit numbers for b and b's children in an in-order walk from a gappy sequence, where n is the first number not yet assigned or reserved.
select statements may introduce flakiness: whether this test contains a race depends on the scheduling (some may argue that the code contains this race by definition)
simpleLetterEqualFold is a specialization of bytes.EqualFold for use when s is all ASCII letters (no underscores, etc) and also doesn't contain 'k', 'K', 's', or 'S'.
tests that Conn.Read returns (non-zero, io.EOF) instead of (non-zero, nil) when a Close (alertCloseNotify) is sitting right behind the application data in the buffer.
1) find reverse postordering 2) find approximate dominators, the actual dominators if the flow graph is reducible otherwise, dominators plus some other non-dominators.
Allocating a 512 GB region takes away 39 bits, and the amd64 doesn't let us choose the top 17 bits, so that leaves the 9 bits in the middle of 0x00c0 for us to choose.
Because a channel cannot be reopened, the later observation of the channel being not closed implies that it was also not closed at the moment of the first observation.
Cannot just b.push(inst.Out, pos, 0) b.push(inst.Arg, pos, 0) If during the processing of inst.Out, we encounter inst.Arg via another path, we want to process it then.
Expression checker functions are generally of the form: func f(x *operand, e *ast.Expr, ...) where e is the expression to be checked, and x is the result of the check.
For all functions accepting callerpc and pc, callerpc is a return PC of the function that calls this function, pc is start PC of the function that calls this function.
For external link, record that we need to tell the external linker -s, and turn off -s internally: the external linker needs the symbol information for its final link.
For instance, in method declarations, the receiver is treated like an ordinary parameter list and thus may contain multiple entries where the spec permits exactly one.
Gob can encode a value of any type implementing the GobEncoder or encoding.BinaryMarshaler interfaces by calling the corresponding method, in that order of preference.
If a node under test supports both IPv6 capability and IPv6 IPv4-mapping capability, we can assume that the node listens on a wildcard address with an AF_INET6 socket.
If any package in a build includes a .cc or other file compiled by the C++ compiler, the go tool will use the -extld option to set the host linker to the C++ compiler.
If n ops run in under a second and the ratio doesn't work out, make n bigger, trying to reduce the effect that a constant amount of overhead has on the computed ratio.
If there is no current lookahead token (because the parser has not called Lex or has consumed the token returned by the most recent call to Lex), Lookahead returns -1.
If we received a client cert in response to our certificate request message, the client will send us a certificateVerifyMsg immediately after the clientKeyExchangeMsg.
In this case, we know getg() always returns the same result within a given function and we want to avoid the temporaries, so we do the rewrite earlier than is typical.
Needs to be a separate phase because it must run after both lowering and a subsequent dead code elimination (because lowering rules may leave dead generic ops behind).
Note: wrote out full expression instead of calling add(p, n) to reduce the number of temporaries generated by the compiler for this trivial expression during inlining.
Now ignore the provided context (which will be canceled) and use a different one to make sure this completes with a valid connection, which we hope to be closed below:
On the other hand, a free list maintained as part of a short-lived object is not a suitable use for a Pool, since the overhead does not amortize well in that scenario.
Or, better: keep a map in DB of query string to Stmts, and have Stmt.Execute do the right thing and re-prepare if the Conn in use doesn't have that prepared statement.
ReplaceAllStringFunc returns a copy of src in which all matches of the Regexp have been replaced by the return value of function repl applied to the matched substring.
ShouldRepeat reports whether it would be worthwhile to use a Repeat to describe c elements of n bits each, compared to just emitting c copies of the n-bit description.
The dst.Set equivalent is a batch version of the algorithm used by color.Palette's Index method in image/color/color.go, plus optional Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion.
The effect can be seen, for example, as time.Sleep(100ms) is actually shorter then 100ms when measured as difference between time.Now before and after time.Sleep call.
The file set is provided to the printer so that it knows about the original source formatting and can add additional line breaks where they were present in the source.
The importer recognizes this mode automatically (i.e., it can import export data produced with debugging support even if debugFormat is not set at the time of import).
The returned context's Done channel is closed when the returned cancel function is called or when the parent context's Done channel is closed, whichever happens first.
This includes bytes blackened in scanned objects, noscan objects that go straight to black, and permagrey objects scanned by markroot during the concurrent scan phase.
This is safe because we cannot expect the interface type to appear in a cycle, as any such cycle must contain a named type which would have been first defined earlier.
To calculate the offset into the section the relocation is referencing, we subtract the vaddr of the start of the referenced section found in the original object file.
To call into the C function f from Go, the cgo-generated code calls runtime.cgocall(_cgo_Cfunc_f, frame), where _cgo_Cfunc_f is a gcc-compiled function written by cgo.
Want to give up and return, but have to unregister first, so that any notewakeup racing with the return does not try to grant us the semaphore when we don't expect it.
We can have a closing brace for a range on the same line as a condition for an "else if" and we don't want that brace to steal the count for the condition on the "if".
We can't use -r to pick them up because we can't combine split-stack and non-split-stack code in a single -r link, and libgo picks up non-split-stack code from libffi.
We used to use 16 because the GC programs do have some constant overhead to get started, and processing 128 pointers seems to be enough to amortize that overhead well.
We're not timing out immediately and there's no way we would be done before we entered the handler, but the race detector doesn't know this, so synchronize explicitly.
Windows CreateProcess takes the command line as a single string: use attr.CmdLine if set, else build the command line by escaping and joining each argument with spaces
adjBlock prints an "adjacent" block (e.g., a for-loop or function body) following a header (e.g., a for-loop control clause or function signature) of given headerSize.
getLength decodes the next uint and makes sure it is a possible size for a data item that follows, which means it must fit in a non-negative int and fit in the buffer.
heapBitsForObject returns the base address for the heap object containing the address p, the heapBits for base, the object's span, and of the index of the object in s.
if the node has associated documentation, include that commentgroup in the range (the comment list is sorted in the order of the comment appearance in the source code)
ticketSupported is set in a resumption handshake if the ticket from the client was encrypted with an old session ticket key and thus a refreshed ticket should be sent.
uevar: upward exposed variables (used before set in block) varkill: killed variables (set in block) avarinit: addrtaken variables set or used (proof of initialization)
01: scalar  not marked 10: pointer not marked 11: pointer     marked 00: scalar      marked Xoring with 01 will flip the pattern from marked to unmarked and vica versa.
AppendQuoteRuneToGraphic appends a single-quoted Go character literal representing the rune, as generated by QuoteRuneToGraphic, to dst and returns the extended buffer.
As a sanity check, the GC has a 'checkmark' mode that retraverses the object graph with the world stopped, to make sure that everything that should be marked is marked.
Because interpreting an interface requires dereferencing the itab word, the misinterpretation will try to deference Inner.P1, causing a crash during garbage collection.
Common case for escapes is 16 bits 000000000xxxEEEE where commonest cases for xxx encoding in-to-out pointer flow are 000, 001, 010, 011  and EEEE is computed Esc bits.
FindAllIndex returns a sorted list of non-overlapping matches of the regular expression r, where a match is a pair of indices specifying the matched slice of x.Bytes().
Go spec: The scope of an identifier denoting a constant, type, variable, or function (but not method) declared at top level (outside any function) is the package block.
If we are approaching a merge point and we are the primary predecessor of it, find live values that we use soon after the merge point and promote them to registers now.
If we're running a long test, start with a long duration because some of the tests (e.g., TestStackBarrierProfiling) are trying to make sure something *doesn't* happen.
In go, we don't have to be so paranoid: since the only mutating method Sort can call is TestingData.swap, it suffices here just to check that the final slice is sorted.
In parallel with the scan through the ytable for the appropriate line, there is a z pointer that starts out pointing at the strange magic byte list in the Optab struct.
It also tests that the connReader stitches together its background 1-byte read for CloseNotifier when CloseNotifier doesn't fire with the rest of the second HTTP later.
It is hard to check for the allocations, but it is easy to check that if you call the function twice at the same stack level, the pointers returned should be different.
It is safe in this package because the referent may only point to something a Value may point to, and that is always in the heap (due to the escapes() call in ValueOf).
It's a bit of a fluke that this is possible without rewriting the instructions more comprehensively, and it only does because we only support a single TLS variable (g).
NewReadLogger returns a reader that behaves like r except that it logs (using log.Print) each read to standard error, printing the prefix and the hexadecimal data read.
Note that the implements of Arg that follow are all sized so that on a 64-bit machine the data can be inlined in the interface value instead of requiring an allocation.
Note: wrote out full expression instead of calling add(p, -n) to reduce the number of temporaries generated by the compiler for this trivial expression during inlining.
Note: wrote out full expression instead of calling addb(p, 1) to reduce the number of temporaries generated by the compiler for this trivial expression during inlining.
On LR machines, if there is a stack barrier on the return from the frame containing sp, this will mark it as hit even though it isn't, but it's okay to be conservative.
Order what's left by id or symbol name, just so that sort is forced into a specific ordering, so that the result of the sort does not depend on the sort implementation.
Second, when returning from a signal handler, the PC and SP updates are performed by the operating system in an atomic update, so the g update must be done before them.
TODO(bradfitz): non-GET/HEAD requests require more work: sending a different status code on matches, and also can't use weak cache validators (those with a "W/ prefix).
That form of instruction must read all the parameters for correctness, and similarly it must not read the out arguments - they won't be set until the new function runs.
The DWARF spec places no restriction on the ordering of attributes in the Abbrevs and DIEs, and we will always write them out in the order of declaration in the abbrev.
The argument skip is the number of stack frames to skip before recording in pc, with 0 identifying the frame for Callers itself and 1 identifying the caller of Callers.
The go command builds most objects in a temporary directory, so go clean is mainly concerned with object files left by other tools or by manual invocations of go build.
The priorities assigned ensure that, all else being equal, the execution prefers to do what it would have done first in a simple depth-first dependency order traversal.
The program is syntactically valid regardless of whether each name is a type or an ordinary identifier, so there will be no syntax errors that might stop parsing early.
The time routines provide no way to get absolute time (seconds since zero), but we need it to compute the right answer for bizarre roundings like "to the nearest 3 ns".
This function assumes that r is entirely within dst's bounds and the translation of r from dst coordinate space to src coordinate space is entirely within src's bounds.
This must not be run from the serve goroutine itself, else it might deadlock writing to sc.wantWriteFrameCh (which is only mildly buffered and is read by serve itself).
Thus we take c.handshakeMutex first and, if we find that a handshake is needed, then we unlock, acquire c.in and c.handshakeMutex in the correct order, and check again.
We also know that ind has the form (Phi min nxt) where nxt is (Add inc nxt) which means: 1) inc dominates nxt and 2) there is a loop starting at inc and containing nxt.
We don't actually know how big the stack is, like we don't know how big any scheduling stack is, but we assume there's at least 32 kB, which is more than enough for us.
When scanning with Scanf, Fscanf, and Sscanf, all non-empty runs of space characters (except newline) are equivalent to a single space in both the format and the input.
When there is a very small live set but a lot of allocation, simply collecting when the heap reaches GOGC*live results in many GC cycles and high total per-GC overhead.
Windows and Plan 9 already do this correctly, but are structured with different syscalls such that they don't use Lstat, so the hook below for testing it wouldn't work.
add method to type unless type was imported before and method exists already TODO(gri) This leads to a quadratic algorithm - ok for now because method counts are small.
maxPostHandlerReadBytes is the max number of Request.Body bytes not consumed by a handler that the server will read from the client in order to keep a connection alive.
mygetpwnam_r is a wrapper around getpwnam_r to avoid passing a size_t to getpwnam_r, because for unknown reasons passing a size_t to getpwnam_r doesn't work on Solaris.
walk traverses the AST x, calling visit(y) for each node y in the tree but also with a pointer to each ast.Expr, ast.Stmt, and *ast.BlockStmt, in a bottom-up traversal.
Apple clang version 1.7 (tags/Apple/clang-77) (based on LLVM 2.9svn) doesn't have -Wno-unneeded-internal-declaration, so we need yet another flag to disable the warning.
But do at least 500 iterations (which should take about 100ms), otherwise TestCPUProfileMultithreaded can fail if only one thread is scheduled during the testing period.
But on real 64-bit systems, where words are larger but the stack limit is not, even timediv is too heavy, and we really need to use just an ordinary machine instruction.
If flush is true, Decode assumes that src represents the end of the input stream and processes it completely rather than wait for the completion of another 32-bit block.
In concurrent GC, this happens during concurrent mark and we depend on addfinalizer to ensure the above invariants for objects that get finalizers after concurrent mark.
In earlier versions of Go, the returned string was used to derive the compiler and linker tool names, the default object file suffix, and the default linker output name.
In order to minimize the amount of information needed to build a tree bzip2 uses a canonical tree so that it can be reconstructed given only the code length assignments.
It allocates a bit vector with (length of input) * (length of prog) bits, to make sure it never explores the same (character position, instruction) state multiple times.
Link, typically invoked as ``go tool link,'' reads the Go archive or object for a package main, along with its dependencies, and combines them into an executable binary.
Note that if buf.Bytes() is non-empty, the caller usually shows buf.Bytes() and does not print err at all, so the prefix here does not make most output any more verbose.
On OpenBSD, interference from TestSelfConnect is mysteriously causing the first attempt to hang for a few seconds, so we throw away the first result and keep the second.
Provided that T2 is no larger than T1 and that the two share an equivalent memory layout, this conversion allows reinterpreting data of one type as data of another type.
Required for moving heap allocations onto stack, which in turn is required by the closure implementation, which stores the addresses of stack variables into the closure.
Rmdir might also return ENOTDIR if given a bad file path, like /etc/passwd/foo, but in that case, both errors will be ENOTDIR, so it's okay to use the error from unlink.
Still in STW but gcphase is _GCoff, reset to _GCmarktermination At this point all objects will be found during the gcMark which does a complete STW mark and object scan.
TLS "var" in initial exec mode: will become a memory address (chosen by the program linker) that the dynamic linker will fill with the offset from the thread local base.
TODO(aram): Once we remove all instances of C calling sysvicallN, make sysvicallN return errors and replace the body of the following functions with calls to sysvicallN.
TempFile creates a new temporary file in the directory dir with a name beginning with prefix, opens the file for reading and writing, and returns the resulting *os.File.
TestReadTruncation test the ending condition on various truncated files and that truncated files are still detected even if the underlying io.Reader satisfies io.Seeker.
The -f flag, valid only when -u is set, forces get -u not to verify that each package has been checked out from the source control repository implied by its import path.
The gccgo sources have a syslog_solaris.go file that implements unixSyslog to return a type that satisfies this interface and simply calls the C library syslog function.
The heap is swept span-by-span both lazily (when a goroutine needs another span) and concurrently in a background goroutine (this helps programs that are not CPU bound).
The operations are needed, however, in order to let the log closer set the high bit to indicate "EOF" safely in the situation when normally the goroutine "owns" handoff.
The test filenames do not end in .go so that they are invisible to gofmt since they contain comments that must not change their positions relative to surrounding tokens.
To make it possible for gcc-compiled C code to call a Go function p.GoF, cgo writes a gcc-compiled function named GoF (not p.GoF, since gcc doesn't know about packages).
We try to run this test with increasingly larger multiples until one works so slow, loaded hardware isn't as flaky, but without slowing down fast machines unnecessarily.
When we see an R_PPC64_REL24 relocation to a dynamic symbol (indicating that the call needs to go through the PLT), we generate up to three stubs and reserve a PLT slot.
a field declaration cannot start with a '(' but we accept it here for more robust parsing and better error messages (parseFieldDecl will check and complain if necessary)
case OTARRAY, OTMAP, OTCHAN, OTSTRUCT, OTINTER, OTFUNC: unreachable - should have been resolved by typechecking case OCLOSURE: unimplemented case OCOMPLIT: unimplemented
configuration passed to constructor handshakeComplete is true if the connection is currently transfering application data (i.e. is not currently processing a handshake).
escapeTemplateBody escapes the given template assuming the given output context, and returns the best guess at the output context and whether the assumption was correct.
line path/to/file:linenumber The //line directive specifies that the source line that follows should be recorded as having come from the given file path and line number.
param parses and returns a function parameter list entry which may be a parameter name and type pair (name, typ), a single type (nil, typ), or a single name (name, nil).
pattern would cause us to hit 2**256, but that causes problems when multiplying as terms end up one bit short of a limb which would require much bit-shifting to correct.
+build ignore This file is run by the x509 tests to ensure that a program with minimal imports can sign certificates without errors resulting from missing hash functions.
6g accepts the program below even though it is syntactically incorrect: Each statement in the list of statements for each case clause must be terminated with a semicolon.
Also, if x is a constant, it must be representable as a value of typ, and if x is the (formerly untyped) lhs operand of a non-constant shift, it must be an integer value.
Any comments that need to appear before that token are printed first, taking into account the amount and structure of any pending white- space for best comment placement.
Column cells must be tab-terminated, not tab-separated: non-tab terminated trailing text at the end of a line forms a cell but that cell is not part of an aligned column.
Each element in a JSON object or array begins on a new, indented line beginning with prefix followed by one or more copies of indent according to the indentation nesting.
HACK: If the first argument of IsInBounds or IsSliceInBounds is a constant and we already know that constant is smaller (or equal) to the upper bound than this is proven.
If a named package cannot be loaded at all (for example, if the directory does not exist), then packages prints an error and does not include that package in the results.
Package dwarf provides access to DWARF debugging information loaded from executable files, as defined in the DWARF 2.0 Standard at http://dwarfstd.org/doc/dwarf-2.0.0.pdf
Rather than calling this function directly, clients should typically use the DWARF method of the File type of the appropriate package debug/elf, debug/macho, or debug/pe.
Some directories contain main packages: Only accept files that belong to the expected package so that parser.ParsePackage doesn't return "multiple packages found" errors.
The Call method waits for the remote call to complete while the Go method launches the call asynchronously and signals completion using the Call structure's Done channel.
The Comments list contains all comments in the source file in order of appearance, including the comments that are pointed to from other nodes via Doc and Comment fields.
The traceback function may be called from an execution thread other than the one that recorded the context, but only when the context is known to be valid and unchanging.
This lock solves that race: the create new fd/mark close-on-exec operation is done holding ForkLock for reading, and the fork itself is done holding ForkLock for writing.
Unfortunately, occasionally the signal is delivered to a Go thread, which winds up discarding it because it was sent by another program and there is no Go handler for it.
We really should verify that "panic" is the predefined function, but without type checking we can't and the likelihood of it being an actual problem is vanishingly small.
cachedOrNewConn returns a cached connection, if available, else waits for one to become available (if MaxOpenConns has been reached) or creates a new database connection.
checkRangeLoop walks the body of the provided range statement, checking if its index or value variables are used unsafely inside goroutines or deferred function literals.
delayed white space Positions The out position differs from the pos position when the result formatting differs from the source formatting (in the amount of white space).
indirectToStringerOrError returns the value, after dereferencing as many times as necessary to reach the base type (or nil) or an implementation of fmt.Stringer or error,
intersperse extra newlines if present in the source and if they don't cause extra semicolons (don't do this in flush as it will cause extra newlines at the end of a file)
numLiterals      The number of literals in literalEncoding numOffsets       The number of offsets in offsetEncoding litenc, offenc   The literal and offset encoder to use
numberBlock returns the smallest number not yet assigned or reserved (i.e., the exit number of the last block visited, plus two, because last.exit+1 is a reserved value.)
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group".
2) If there is a mix of level 5 and level 4 operators, then the cutoff is 5 (use spaces to distinguish precedence) in Normal mode and 4 (never use spaces) in Compact mode.
Any type that implements heap.Interface may be used as a min-heap with the following invariants (established after Init has been called or if the data is empty or sorted):
If a kernel happens to pick local port 50001 as the source for a Dial("tcp", "", "localhost:50001"), then the Dial will succeed, having simultaneously connected to itself.
If the certificate is signed by a certificate authority, the certFile should be the concatenation of the server's certificate, any intermediates, and the CA's certificate.
If there's exactly one rhs initializer, use the same declInfo d1 for all lhs variables so that each lhs variable depends on the same rhs initializer (n:1 var declaration).
If we ask for the end of the data segment but the operating system requires a little more space before we can start allocating, it will give out a slightly higher pointer.
It gathers the C preamble attached to the import "C" comment, a list of references to C.xxx, a list of exported functions, and the actual AST, to be rewritten and printed.
It might make sense to expand this to allow statement patterns, but there are problems with preserving formatting and also with what a wildcard for a statement looks like.
LookupParent follows the parent chain of scopes starting with s until it finds a scope where Lookup(name) returns a non-nil object, and then returns that scope and object.
NOTE: It's possible we could make ppc64 closer to other architectures: ppc64's .plt is like .plt.got on other platforms and ppc64's .glink is like .plt on other platforms.
NOTE: The bitmap for a specific type t should be cached in t after the first run and then simply copied into bv at the correct offset on future calls with the same type t.
On OS X when using external linking to build a shared library, the argument passed here to -o ends up recorded in the final shared library in the LC_ID_DYLIB load command.
PE (Portable Executable) file writing http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/platform/firmware/PECOFF.mspx DOS stub that prints out "This program cannot be run in DOS mode."
RuntimeError is a no-op function but serves to distinguish types that are run time errors from ordinary errors: a type is a run time error if it has a RuntimeError method.
Since PC must be last, there the possible partial transitions in ordinary execution are (1) g alone is updated, (2) both g and SP are updated, and (3) SP alone is updated.
TestLineComments, using a simple test case, checks that consecutive line comments are properly terminated with a newline even if the AST position information is incorrect.
The banner is five lines so that when changes to different sections of the bootstrap script have to be merged, the banners give patch something to use to find its context.
The compiler will lay out the code so that the if body occurs above the *x, so if the liveness info at the *x is used, it will find the liveness at the call to runtime.GC.
The shared library contains a note containing the ABI hash that is mapped into memory and there is a local symbol called go.link.abihashbytes that points 16 bytes into it.
The system uses the token to control access to securable objects and to control the ability of the user to perform various system-related operations on the local computer.
This assumes adding an exported function breaks ABI, which is not true in some senses but suffices for the narrow definition of ABI compatibility the toolchain uses today.
To get the address of such a field (which is the only operation you can do with a zero-sized field) you must take the address of the struct and add the size of the struct.
We don't believe that logic is the right thing to do in general, but when testing against libopcodes it simplifies the comparison if we adjust a few small pieces of logic.
We want to provide access to a broader range of (simulated) files than Native Client allows, so we maintain our own file descriptor table exposed to higher-level packages.
nonnilptr returns the Value, if any, that is non-nil due to b being the successor block of an OpIsNonNil or OpNilCheck block for the value and having a single predecessor.
supportedSignatureAlgorithms contains the signature and hash algorithms that the code advertises as supported in a TLS 1.2 ClientHello and in a TLS 1.2 CertificateRequest.
"shared": combine all packages passed on the command line, and their dependencies, into a single shared library that will be used when building with the -linkshared option.
1) Compute normalized mantissa mant and exponent exp for x such that the lsb of mant corresponds to 1/2 ulp for the precision of x (i.e., for mant we want x.prec + 1 bits).
After the fix to unblock TCP Reads in https://golang.org/cl/15941, this sleep is required on plan9 to make sure TCP Writes before an immediate TCP close go out on the wire.
Because the checks are dynamic, such methods would not cause a compile error if they have the wrong signature: instead the dynamic check would fail, sometimes mysteriously.
Comment content does not correspond to any parsed structure or human-readable content, so the simplest and most secure policy is to drop content interpolated into comments.
Compute maximum common white prefix of all but the first, last, and blank lines, and replace blank lines with empty lines (the first line starts with /* and has no prefix).
DecryptPKCS1v15SessionKey is designed for this situation and copies the decrypted, symmetric key (if well-formed) in constant-time over a buffer that contains a random key.
Design note: It is tempting to eliminate extra blanks occurring in whitespace in this function as it could simplify some of the blanks logic in the node printing functions.
Everywhere in the runtime and reflect packages, it is assumed that there is exactly one *_type per Go type, so that pointer equality can be used to test if types are equal.
For more than 8 characters section names, name contains a slash (/) that is followed by an ASCII representation of a decimal number that is an offset into the string table.
However, if after discovering new work we also observe no idle Ps, it is OK to just park the current thread: the system is fully loaded so no spinning threads are required.
If a struct type T can be reached more than once at a given depth level, then it annihilates itself and need not be considered at all when we process that next depth level.
If name is not an absolute path and is not a known system DLL used by Go, Windows will search for the named DLL in many locations, causing potential DLL preloading attacks.
If printTests is set, we record the coverage value before and after, and we write out the inputs for which coverage went up, in the format expected in testdata/decode.text.
If systemstack is called from the per-OS-thread (g0) stack, or if systemstack is called from the signal handling (gsignal) stack, systemstack calls fn directly and returns.
If the frame size is 8, it's only an LR, so there's no potential for breaking references to local variables by growing the frame size, because there are no local variables.
If the syscall wrote some data but not all (short write) or it returned EINTR, then assume it stopped early for reasons that are uninteresting to the caller, and try again.
In a heavily loaded system, it's possible these will be delayed, so this is designed to succeed quickly if things are working, but to give it some slack if things are slow.
In the rare case in which both operands are constant (e.g. runtime.GOOS and "windows"), we'll only catch mistakes if the LHS is repeated, which is how most code is written.
It should record in the Context field whatever information is needed about the current point of execution to later produce a stack trace, probably the stack pointer and PC.
MatchFile reports whether the file with the given name in the given directory matches the context and would be included in a Package created by ImportDir of that directory.
Nodes may contain additional position info for language constructs where comments may be found between parts of the construct (typically any larger, parenthesized subpart).
One wrinkle: A "naked return" is a silent use of a variable that the Span will not capture, but the compilers catch naked returns of shadowed variables so we don't need to.
Systems that require the initial-exec model, where you load the TLS base into a register and then index from that register, do not reach this code and should not be listed.
Technically the rate is MemProfileRate not 2*MemProfileRate, but early versions of the C++ heap profiler reported 2*MemProfileRate, so that's what pprof has come to expect.
Test for select: Issue 2075 A bug in select corrupts channel queues of failed cases if there are multiple waiters on those channels and the select is the last in the queue.
The analysis assumes that closures and the functions in which they appear are analyzed together, so that the aliasing between their variables can be modeled more precisely.
The decodeOps correspond to consuming and conditionally branching on input bytes, consuming additional fields, and then interpreting consumed data as instruction arguments.
The for loop either exits when a work buffer is found or when _all_ of the work.nproc GC helpers are in the loop looking for work and thus not capable of creating new work.
The original C code, the long comment, and the constants below were from http://netlib.sandia.gov/cephes/cmath/sin.c, available from http://www.netlib.org/cephes/cmath.tgz.
The type of wireType itself is known (it's built in, as is the type of all its components), so we just need to send a *value* of type wireType that represents type "Point".
There may be multiple examples for a given function, constant, or variable, distinguished by a trailing _xxx, where xxx is a suffix not beginning with an upper case letter.
This flag is for bootstrapping a new Go implementation, to generate Go types that match the data layout and constant values used in the host's C libraries and system calls.
This isn't a perfect number scanner - for instance it accepts "." and "0x0.2" and "089" - but when it's wrong the input is invalid and the parser (via strconv) will notice.
Untyped constant expression values that become fully typed must now be representable by the full type (constant sub-expression trees are left alone except for their roots).
Using //export in a file places a restriction on the preamble: since it is copied into two different C output files, it must not contain any definitions, only declarations.
Using SysFault here means that the program will run out of memory fairly quickly in efence mode, but at least it won't have mysterious crashes due to confused memory reuse.
We're very careful here not to have any operation between the e.word and e.typ assignments that would let the garbage collector observe the partially-built interface value.
When the IP node supports IPv4-mapped IPv6 address, we allow an listener to listen to the wildcard address of both IP addressing spaces by specifying IPv6 wildcard address.
addFieldInfo adds finfo to tinfo.fields if there are no conflicts, or if conflicts arise from previous fields that were obtained from deeper embedded structures than finfo.
loadImport scans the directory named by path, which must be an import path, but possibly a local import path (an absolute file system path or one beginning with ./ or ../).
An implementation that always returns "" is valid and may be useful for testing but it is not secure: it means that the HTTP server for foo.com can set a cookie for bar.com.
Annotations in the template refer to elements of the data structure (typically a field of a struct or a key in a map) to control execution and derive values to be displayed.
As ELF section names are not supposed to be special, one looks for a particular note by scanning all SHT_NOTE sections looking for a note with a particular "name" and "tag".
Caution: stmt will emit more than one node for statement nodes n that have a non-empty n.Ninit and where n cannot have a natural init section (such as in "if", "for", etc.).
DeepEqual has been defined so that the same short-cut applies to slices and maps: if x and y are the same slice or the same map, they are deeply equal regardless of content.
ExpectContinueTimeout is unsupported in http2, so if they explicitly asked for it (as opposed to just using the DefaultTransport, which sets it), then disable http2 for now.
For example, a type might implement a Scan method that has nothing to do with fmt.Scanner, but we still want to check the methods that are intended to implement fmt.Scanner.
For example, paths used internally at Google all begin with 'google', and paths denoting remote repositories begin with the path to the code, such as 'github.com/user/repo'.
GobDecode overwrites the receiver, which must be a pointer, with the value represented by the byte slice, which was written by GobEncode, usually for the same concrete type.
If it is a heavy weight allocation the caller must determine whether a new GC cycle needs to be started or if the GC is active whether this goroutine needs to assist the GC.
If the declaration token changed (e.g., from CONST to TYPE) or the next declaration has documentation associated with it, print an empty line between top-level declarations.
If the provided body is also an io.Closer, the returned Request.Body is set to body and will be closed by the Client methods Do, Post, and PostForm, and Transport.RoundTrip.
If there is no package specified or matched, the package in the current directory is selected, so "go doc Foo" shows the documentation for symbol Foo in the current package.
MD5 was designed so that x86 processors can just iterate over the block data directly as uint32s, and we generate less code and run 1.3x faster if we take advantage of that.
Note: wrote out full expression instead of calling subtractb(p, 1) to reduce the number of temporaries generated by the compiler for this trivial expression during inlining.
TestReadResponseCloseInMiddle tests that closing a body after reading only part of its contents advances the read to the end of the request, right up until the next request.
Tests that method calls through an interface always call the locally defined method localT.m independent at which embedding level it is and in which order embedding is done.
The exact temporary names are inconsequential but we are trying to check that there is only one at any given site, and also that none show up in "ambiguously live" messages.
The original C code, the long comment, and the constants below were from http://netlib.sandia.gov/cephes/cmath/atan.c, available from http://www.netlib.org/cephes/cmath.tgz.
The third case is handled by looking to see if any of: - reflect.Value.Call is reachable - reflect.Value.Method is reachable - reflect.Type.Method or MethodByName is called.
The two sizes that follow here can be either 32 bits or 64 bits but the spec is not very clear on this and different interpretations has been made causing incompatibilities.
The upper and lower bounds are possible outputs only if the original mantissa is even, so that IEEE round-to-even would round to the original mantissa and not the neighbors.
These three formatting routines call the Qualifier for each package-level object O, and if the Qualifier returns a non-empty string p, the object is printed in the form p.O.
Unfortunately for us, we need to do our own flag processing because go test grabs some flags but otherwise its command line is just a holding place for pkg.test's arguments.
When a goroutine explicitly frees an object or sets a finalizer, it ensures that the span is swept (either by sweeping it, or by waiting for the concurrent sweep to finish).
checkQueryStringHandler checks if r.URL.RawQuery has the same value as the URL excluding the scheme and the query string and sends 200 response code if it is, 500 otherwise.
emit a pair of "scattered" relocations that resolve to the difference of section addresses of the symbol and the instruction this value is added to the field being relocated
found a potential match spec: "A method call x.m() is valid if the method set of (the type of) x contains m and the argument list can be assigned to the parameter list of m.
issue 12413: invalid variable name x in type switch: code would fail to compile if the variable used in the short variable declaration was previously declared as a constant.
register parses a full register reference where there is no symbol present (as in 4(R0) or R(10) but not sym(SB)) including forms involving multiple registers such as R1:R2.
retryWithBuffer repeatedly calls f(), increasing the size of the buffer each time, until f succeeds, fails with a non-ERANGE error, or the buffer exceeds a reasonable limit.
to make the CaseRanges text shorter If the Delta field of a CaseRange is UpperLower, it means this CaseRange represents a sequence of the form (say) Upper Lower Upper Lower.
waitCondition reports whether fn eventually returned true, checking immediately and then every checkEvery amount, until waitFor has elapsed, at which point it returns false.
we almost always want the original, except in export mode for literals this saves the importer some work, and avoids us having to redo some special casing for package unsafe
(See details in comment above.) Catch calls that might, by replacing the stack guard with something that will trip any stack check and leaving a flag to tell newstack to die.
A 'VARDEF x' annotation in the instruction stream tells the liveness analysis to behave as though the variable x is being initialized at that point in the instruction stream.
A Go function called by C code may take a Go pointer as an argument, but it must preserve the property that the Go memory to which it points does not contain any Go pointers.
As an optimization, we can initialize the min bits to read at a time for the HLIT tree to the length of the EOB marker since we know that every block must terminate with one.
Compute the mutator assist ratio so by the time the mutator allocates the remaining heap bytes up to next_gc, it will have done (or stolen) the remaining amount of scan work.
For client requests, the URL's Host specifies the server to connect to, while the Request's Host field optionally specifies the Host header value to send in the HTTP request.
For example, the socket data structures refer to in_addr and in_addr6 structs but we want to be able to treat them as byte arrays, so the godefs inputs in package syscall say
Gccgo chose the wrong embedded method when the same type appeared at different levels and the correct choice was not the first appearance of the type in a depth-first search.
However, it breaks the invariant that the msb is always the "continuation bit" and thus makes the format incompatible with a varint encoding for larger numbers (say 128-bit).
If an operand implements method String() string, that method will be invoked to convert the object to a string, which will then be formatted as required by the verb (if any).
If another command was kicked off while we were writing the cgo binary, the child process for that command may be holding a reference to the fd, keeping us from running exec.
If there is no match for a particular pattern, downloadPaths leaves it in the result list, in the hope that we can figure out the repository from the initial ...-free prefix.
In all the scanning functions, if an operand implements method Scan (that is, it implements the Scanner interface) that method will be used to scan the text for that operand.
It wraps an io.Reader or io.Writer object, creating another object (Reader or Writer) that also implements the interface but provides buffering and some help for textual I/O.
Must make a copy, because f might keep a reference to it, and we cannot let f keep a reference to the stack frame after this function returns, not even a read-only reference.
NOTE(rsc,rlh): If gcworkbuffree comes back, we need to coordinate with the stealing of gcworkbufs during garbage collection to avoid a race where the workbuf is double-freed.
NewWriteLogger returns a writer that behaves like w except that it logs (using log.Printf) each write to standard error, printing the prefix and the hexadecimal data written.
Open opens a database specified by its database driver name and a driver-specific data source name, usually consisting of at least a database name and connection information.
Queue embedded struct fields for processing with next level, but only if we haven't seen a match yet at this level and only if the embedded types haven't already been queued.
Stack frames and global variables in the data and bss sections are described by 1-bit bitmaps in which 0 means uninteresting and 1 means live pointer to be visited during GC.
That would lead to an inconsistent trace: - either GoSysExit appears before EvGoInSyscall, - or GoSysExit appears for a goroutine for which we don't emit EvGoInSyscall below.
The install command should have created a "shlibname" file for the listed packages (and runtime/cgo, and math on arm) indicating the name of the shared library containing it.
The list is assumed to have two kinds of entries: names without slashes, which are commands, and entries beginning with internal/, which are packages supporting the commands.
The prefix is computed using heuristics such that is likely that the comment contents are nicely laid out after re-printing each line using the printer's current indentation.
The rounding mode can be detected by checking whether huge + tiny is equal to huge, and whether huge - tiny is equal to huge for some floating point number "huge" and "tiny".
The typical use of a Writer is to call Init, maybe call Debug, make a sequence of Ptr, Advance, Repeat, and Append calls to describe the data type, and then finally call End.
There are four reserved names for paths that should not be used for packages to be built with the go tool: - "main" denotes the top-level package in a stand-alone executable.
This process continues building additional simple chains until the first self-signed certificate is a trusted certificate or until an additional simple chain cannot be built.
To further complicate matters, for non-interleaved scans, there is no data for any blocks that are inside the image at the MCU level but outside the image at the pixel level.
file was parsed already - do not add it again to the file set otherwise the position information returned here will not match the position information collected by the parser
issue 7690 - Stack and other routines did not back up initial PC into CALL instruction, instead reporting line number of next instruction, which might be on a different line.
parseWord skips any leading spaces or comments in data and then parses the beginning of data as an identifier or keyword, returning that word and what remains after the word.
runtime.cgocall (below) locks g to m, calls entersyscall so as not to block other goroutines or the garbage collector, and then calls runtime.asmcgocall(_cgo_Cfunc_f, frame).
* If the XML element contains a sub-element whose name matches a field without any mode flags (",attr", ",chardata", etc), Unmarshal maps the sub-element to that struct field.
An Initializer describes a package-level variable, or a list of variables in case of a multi-valued initialization expression, and the corresponding initialization expression.
By default, Linux's "transparent huge page" support will merge pages into a huge page if there's even a single present regular page, undoing the effects of the DONTNEED below.
Compared to the WebSafe, the idea is to reduce the color resolution by dicing the color cube into fewer cells, and to use the extra space to increase the intensity resolution.
Description of testing functions The 'go test' command expects to find test, benchmark, and example functions in the "*_test.go" files corresponding to the package under test.
For example, in the pattern "abcxxxabc", when the first mismatch from the back is found to be in position 3, the matching suffix "xxabc" is not found elsewhere in the pattern.
Given a tag string with the format specified in the package comment, parseFieldParameters will parse it into a fieldParameters structure, ignoring unknown parts of the string.
Gob can decode a value of any type implementing the GobDecoder or encoding.BinaryUnmarshaler interfaces by calling the corresponding method, again in that order of preference.
If the visitor w returned by v.Visit(node) is not nil, Walk is invoked recursively with visitor w for each of the non-nil children of node, followed by a call of w.Visit(nil).
In theory, all GOT should point to the first PLT entry, Linux/ARM's dynamic linker will do that for us, but FreeBSD/ARM's dynamic linker won't, so we'd better do it ourselves.
It's important that any use of gcWork during the mark phase prevent the garbage collector from transitioning to mark termination since gcWork may locally hold GC work buffers.
Making the build sensitive to changes in other state is straightforward: include the state in the build ID hash, and if it changes, so does the build ID, triggering a rebuild.
Modified by Wei-Hwa Huang, Google Inc., on 2004-09-24 This is a slower but "safe" version of the old chartorune that works on strings that are not necessarily null-terminated.
On some Linux systems, glibc uses another set of values for the commands and translates them to the correct value that the kernel expects just before the actual fcntl syscall.
Package image/jpeg is not used explicitly in the code below, but is imported for its initialization side-effect, which allows image.Decode to understand JPEG formatted images.
Since mutually recursive sets of functions are allowed, we don't necessarily raise an error if n depends on a node which is already waiting for its dependencies to be visited.
Technically, if the stack were to consist solely of return PCs we would need two thirds of the stack, but stealing that much breaks things and this doesn't happen in practice.
The Parse function sets both Path and RawPath in the URL it returns, and URL's String method uses RawPath if it is a valid encoding of Path, by calling the EscapedPath method.
The chain of function calls between must propagate the Context, optionally replacing it with a modified copy created using WithDeadline, WithTimeout, WithCancel, or WithValue.
The package scope extent (position information) may be incorrect (files spread across a wide range of fset positions) - ignore it and just consider its children (file scopes).
This is not technically the Linux semantics for abstract Unix domain sockets--they are supposed to be uninterpreted fixed-size binary blobs--but everyone uses this convention.
This looks like it's quadratic in the size of the text, but we are not clearing visited between calls to TrySearch, so no work is duplicated and it ends up still being linear.
Upon returning, rawExpr is recording the types and constant values for all expressions that have an untyped type (those types may change on the way up in the expression tree).
We must do this before signaling that we're no longer working so that other workers can't observe no workers and no work while we have this cached, and before we compute done.
When an import and a declaration collide in separate files, present the import as the "redeclared", because the declaration is visible where the import is, but not vice versa.
arm and amd64 distinguish between moves that *must* sign/zero extend and moves that don't care so they can eliminate moves that don't care without breaking moves that do care.
consumeToken consumes a token from the beginning of provided string, per RFC 2045 section 5.1 (referenced from 2183), and return the token consumed and the rest of the string.
fmtP appends the string of x in the format "0x." mantissa "p" exponent with a hexadecimal mantissa and a binary exponent, or "0" if x is zero, and returns the extended buffer.
in those situations, calling defercheckwidth() stops width calculations until resumecheckwidth() is called, at which point all the checkwidths that were deferred are executed.
pos is the comment position, next the position of the item after all pending comments, prev is the previous comment in a group of comments (or nil), and tok is the next token.
probeIPv6Stack probes both basic IPv6 capability and IPv6 IPv4- mapping capability which is controlled by IPV6_V6ONLY socket option and/or kernel state "net.inet6.ip6.v6only".
A run of value columns (V) can be moved into the type column if there is no type for any of the values in that column (we only move entire columns so that they align properly).
BUG(rsc): FieldByName and related functions consider struct field names to be equal if the names are equal, even if they are unexported names originating in different packages.
Corrupt DNS SRV reply, with its final RR having a bogus length (perhaps it was truncated, or it's malicious) The mutation is the capital "FF" below, instead of the proper "21".
Disable stack growth as we don't want Windows to fiddle with the thread stack limits, which we set ourselves to circumvent the stack checks in the Windows exception dispatcher.
For instance, given three *Int values a, b and c, the invocation c.Add(a, b) computes the sum a + b and stores the result in c, overwriting whatever value was held in c before.
If Strict is set, the type-checker enforces additional rules not specified by the Go 1 spec, but which will catch guaranteed run-time errors if the respective code is executed.
If all samples have the same second-to-the-bottom frame, it strongly suggests that it is an uninteresting artifact of measurement -- a stack frame pushed by the signal handler.
If all tests pump to the same channel, a bug can occur where a test kicks off a goroutine that Fails, yet the test still delivers a completion signal, which skews the counting.
If an operand implements the error interface, the Error method will be invoked to convert the object to a string, which will then be formatted as required by the verb (if any).
If the returned token is a literal (token.IDENT, token.INT, token.FLOAT, token.IMAG, token.CHAR, token.STRING) or token.COMMENT, the literal string has the corresponding value.
If this command is 'go install' with no arguments and the current directory (the implicit argument) is a command, remove any leftover command binary from a previous 'go build'.
If this is a forced GC, don't acquire the transition lock or re-check the transition condition because we specifically *don't* want to share the transition with another thread.
If we receive the FIN between the connectedness check and writing/reading from the socket, we may first learn the socket is disconnected when we get a ERR_SOCKET_NOT_CONNECTED.
In general, a given attribute's value may take on one of several possible classes defined by DWARF, each of which leads to a slightly different interpretation of the attribute.
It must be called by users of NewInterface after the interface's embedded types are fully defined and before using the interface type in any way other than to form other types.
Map values are deeply equal if they are the same map object or if they have the same length and their corresponding keys (matched using Go equality) map to deeply equal values.
Mark termination only needs to re-scan the changed part, so for deep stacks this can significantly reduce GC pause time compared to the alternative of re-scanning whole stacks.
Note: This is doing too much work if the precision of z is less than the sum of the precisions of x and y which is often the case (e.g., if all floats have the same precision).
The compilers assume they can generate temporary variables as needed to preserve the right semantics or simplify code generation and the back end will still generate good code.
The greedy allocator moves values into registers just before they are used, spills registers only when necessary, and spills the value whose next use is farthest in the future.
The pause needs to be big enough to let the select block before we run the helper, but if we lose that race once in a while it's okay: the select will just proceed immediately.
Therefore, if we have a left shifted version of this constant we can find by how many bits it was shifted by looking at which six bit substring ended up at the top of the word.
This is still not a complete fix (see golang.org/issue/14271 and next test) but it is clearly OK and enough to fix both of the two reported instances of the underlying problem.
This script requires that three environment variables be set: GOIOS_DEV_ID: The codesigning developer id or certificate identifier GOIOS_APP_ID: The provisioning app id prefix.
This value will contain at least the union of the regs fields of entries, but may contain additional entries for values that were once in this data structure but are no longer.
Waiting to update arena_used until after the memory has been mapped avoids faults when other threads try access the bitmap immediately after observing the change to arena_used.
We record the target of the first time we see a .a file for a package to make sure that we prefer the 'install' rather than the 'build' location (which may not exist any more).
We test an even stronger restriction, that one store can't shadow another unless the types of the address fields are identical (where identicalness is decided by the CSE pass).
Zero the now unused input area of args, because the Values returned by this function contain pointers to the args object, and will thus keep the args object alive indefinitely.
bodyEOFSignal is used by the HTTP/1 transport when reading response bodies to make sure we see the end of a response body before proceeding and reading on the connection again.
readGCStats fills in the pause and end times histories (up to maxPause entries) and then three more: Unix ns time of last GC, number of GC, and total pause time in nanoseconds.
runnext, if non-nil, is a runnable G that was ready'd by the current G and should be run next instead of what's in runq if there's time remaining in the running G's time slice.
stateE0 is the state after reading the mantissa, e, optional sign, and at least one digit of the exponent in a number, such as after reading `314e-2` or `0.314e+1` or `3.14e0`.
- All the optimal in-place sorting/merging algorithms I found are either unstable or rely on enough different elements in each step to encode the performed block rearrangements.
- msym is the method symbol - t is function type (with receiver) - tpkg is the package of the type declaring the method during import, or nil (ignored) --- for verification only
A more systematic approach would always indent, but this would cause significant reformatting of the code base and not necessarily lead to more nicely formatted code in general.
After calling dropg and arranging for gp to be readied later, the caller can do other work but eventually should call schedule to restart the scheduling of goroutines on this m.
Because the http1 Transport doesn't de-dup TCP dials to outbound hosts (because it doesn't know the protocol), it can get into a situation where it has multiple TLS connections.
Callers must inspect the primary return value to decide whether an error occurred (according to the semantics of the specific function being called) before consulting the error.
ErrNoProgress is returned by some clients of an io.Reader when many calls to Read have failed to return any data or error, usually the sign of a broken io.Reader implementation.
Handler also returns the registered pattern that matches the request or, in the case of internally-generated redirects, the pattern that will match after following the redirect.
If a Flush occurs after all the actual data, the flushing semantics dictate that we will observe a (0, io.EOF) since Read must return data before it knows that the stream ended.
If we discover new work below, we need to restore m.spinning as a signal for resetspinning to unpark a new worker thread (because there can be more than one starving goroutine).
In addition to ordinary import paths, loadPackage accepts pseudo-paths beginning with cmd/ to denote commands in the Go command directory, as well as paths to those directories.
In other words, "parsing" the import data (which happens to be encoded in binary rather textual form) is the best way at the moment to re-establish the syntax tree's invariants.
In that case, v must represent a non-nil pointer to data or be an assignable reflect.Value (v.CanSet()) If the input is at EOF, DecodeValue returns io.EOF and does not modify v.
In this case, "foo" could be a series name registered in Launchpad with its own branch, and it could also be the name of a directory within the main project branch one level up.
Note that even for ResponseWriters that support Flush, if the client is connected through an HTTP proxy, the buffered data may not reach the client until the response completes.
Optimization: If we need to shift right, first remove any trailing zero bits from m to reduce shift amount that needs to be done in decimal format (since that is likely slower).
TestPanicUseStack checks that a chain of Panic structs on the stack are updated correctly if the stack grows during the deferred execution that happens as a result of the panic.
The XML element for a struct contains marshalled elements for each of the exported fields of the struct, with these exceptions: - the XMLName field, described above, is omitted.
The following numeric types are supported: Int    signed integers Rat    rational numbers Float  floating-point numbers The zero value for an Int, Rat, or Float correspond to 0.
The problem is usually something like missing quotes or angle brackets, or can be avoided by refactoring to put the two contexts into different branches of an if, range or with.
The upper and lower bounds are possible outputs only if the original mantissa is even, so that ToNearestEven rounding would round to the original mantissa and not the neighbors.
These two cases are valid as textual representations as described in RFC 4007, but are not valid as address literals with IPv6 zone identifiers in URIs as described in RFC 6874.
This confuses register allocation if it occurs before it is complete, so candidates are recorded, then rechecked and moved after all allocation (register and stack) is complete.
This has better constant-time properties than Euclid's method (implemented in math/big.Int.ModInverse) although math/big itself isn't strictly constant-time so it's not perfect.
UnknownLineError represents a failure to map a line to a program counter, either because the line is beyond the bounds of the file or because there is no code on the given line.
Unless vendoring support is disabled (see 'go help gopath'), when go get checks out or updates a Git repository, it also updates any git submodules referenced by the repository.
go:cgo_import_static x_cgo_set_context_function go:linkname x_cgo_set_context_function x_cgo_set_context_function go:linkname _cgo_set_context_function _cgo_set_context_function
parseVarType accepts any type (including parenthesized ones) even though the syntax does not permit them here: we accept them all for more robust parsing and complain afterwards
should be ok These keys can be computed at compile time but they are not constants as defined by the spec, so they do not trigger compile-time errors about duplicate key values.
Check for extra arguments unless the call accessed the arguments out of order, in which case it's too expensive to detect if they've all been used and arguably OK if they're not.
For example when the sweeper is placing an unmarked object on the free list it does not want the write barrier to be called since that could result in the object being reachable.
However, since we're returning to an earlier stack frame and need to pair with the entersyscall() call made by cgocall, we must save syscall* and let reentersyscall restore them.
In order to save everyone who wishes to run the tests from needing the reference implementation installed, the reference connections are saved in files in the testdata directory.
Return value signals whether the exception has been handled (EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_EXECUTION) or should be made available to other handlers in the chain (EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_SEARCH).
The removed elements form a subring and the result is a reference to that subring (if no elements were removed, the result is still the original value for r.Next(), and not nil).
The resulting regexp will execute correctly but its string representation will not produce the same parse tree, because capturing parentheses may have been duplicated or removed.
The transparentIndex is out of range, which is an error according to the spec, but Firefox and Google Chrome seem OK with this, so we enlarge the palette with transparent colors.
This will have the effect of reading many bits out of b, but once the real bits are shifted out, b will supply as many zero bits as we try to read, which is exactly what we need.
To prevent binaries which only using the HTTP Client code (such as cmd/go) from also linking in the HTTP server, don't use a static type assertion to the server "*response" type.
We delay the allocation until then so that it can be done after exitsyscall makes sure it is okay to be running at all (that is, there's no garbage collection running right now).
We do not use channels because we need to be able to handle writes after and during close, and because a chan byte would require too many send and receive operations in real use.
When linking an object that does not contain the runtime we are creating the moduledata from scratch and it does not have a compiler-provided size, so read it from the type data.
DER demands that "If the encoding represents the boolean value TRUE, its single contents octet shall have all eight bits set to one." Thus only 0 and 255 are valid encoded values.
For qualified names, the returned package is nil (and not created if it doesn't exist yet) unless materializePkg is set (which creates an unnamed package with valid package path).
GOARCH, GOOS, and GOROOT are recorded at compile time and made available by constants or functions in this package, but they do not influence the execution of the run-time system.
If a close-notify alert is waiting, read it so that we can return (n, EOF) instead of (n, nil), to signal to the HTTP response reading goroutine that the connection is now closed.
If the header's and block's size are "small enough" and the block is "simple enough", the block is printed on the current line, without line breaks, spaced from the header by sep.
In particular, package net uses cgo on most systems, and we want to preserve the ability to compile pure Go code that imports net without requiring gcc to be present at link time.
Instead of initializing the variables above in the declarations, schedinit calls this function so that the variables are initialized and available earlier in the startup sequence.
It is embedded in other, public struct types, but always with a unique tag like `reflect:"array"` or `reflect:"ptr"` so that code cannot convert from, say, *arrayType to *ptrType.
It is passed the slice element type, the old slice, and the desired new minimum capacity, and it returns a new slice with at least that capacity, with the old data copied into it.
Not part of httptest.Server's correctness, but assume most users of httptest.Server will be using the standard transport, so help them out and close any idle connections for them.
Second, if you are compiling a Go program not in a work space, you can use a relative path in an import statement in that program to refer to nearby code also not in a work space.
Submatches are matches of parenthesized subexpressions (also known as capturing groups) within the regular expression, numbered from left to right in order of opening parenthesis.
The 2-instruction and 1-instruction forms correspond to the two code sequences for loading a TLS variable in the local exec model given in "ELF Handling For Thread-Local Storage".
The errors in the calls there to Getpeername are discarded, but we can't catch the problem there because those calls are sometimes legally erroneous with a "socket not connected".
The practical effect of this is that the result of t.FieldByName("x") is not well defined if the struct type t contains multiple fields named x (embedded from different packages).
The suggested behavior here is to keep trying with ever-larger buffers, but we don't have a dynamic memory allocator at the moment, so that's a bit tricky and seems like overkill.
We arrive here when parsing an interface type declared inside an exported and inlineable function and the interface declares unexported methods (which are then package-qualified).
We know that the argument type must be assignable to the function parameter type, or the code would not compile, but there is nothing requiring that the types be exactly the same.
When GC finishes marking heap, it preempts P's one-by-one and retakes partial wbufs (filled by write barrier or during a stack scan of the goroutine currently scheduled on the P).
Yet another CA reversed the order of the bit flags in the keyUsage due to confusion over encoding endianness, essentially setting a random keyUsage in certificates that it issued.
check assignment to/declaration of iteration variables (irregular assignment, cannot easily map to existing assignment checks) lhs expressions and initialization value (rhs) types
compute an array with the beginnings of productions yielding given nonterminals The array pres points to these lists the array pyield has the lists: the total size is only NPROD+1
connRequest represents one request for a new connection When there are no idle connections available, DB.conn will create a new connRequest and put it on the db.connRequests list.
indentList reports whether an expression list would look better if it were indented wholesale (starting with the very first element, rather than starting at the first line break).
mayberemovefile removes a file only if it is a regular file When running as a user with sufficient privileges, we may delete even device files, for example, which is not intended.
we must unset GOROOT_FINAL before tests, because runtime/debug requires correct access to source code, so if we have GOROOT_FINAL in effect, at least runtime/debug test will fail.
x.M panics if x is an interface type and is nil, or if x.M expands to (*x).M where x is nil, or if x.M expands to x.y.z.w.M where something along the evaluation of x.y.z.w is nil.
(Pipe is close-on-exec so if exec succeeds, it will be closed.) In the child, this function must not acquire any locks, because they might have been locked at the time of the fork.
If a JSON value is not appropriate for a given target type, or if a JSON number overflows the target type, Unmarshal skips that field and completes the unmarshaling as best it can.
If performance is important, the compiler should be changed to recognize the pattern so that all code doing three-way comparisons, not just code using strings.Compare, can benefit.
If the bit is 0, the pattern is already all 0s, but we can claim that the number of bits in the word is equal to the number we need (c), because right shift of bits will zero fill.
If there's a non-zero remainder, the corresponding fractional part (if it were computed), would have a non-zero sticky bit (if it were zero, it couldn't have a non-zero remainder).
In this case a link went directly to a call, but should really go to the dummy .outN outputs that were created for the call that themselves link to the inputs with levels adjusted.
It is a streamlined version of the usual reflect call: the caller has already laid out the argument frame for us, so we don't have to deal with individual Values for each argument.
It's not safe to skip completion notifications for UDP: http://blogs.technet.com/b/winserverperformance/archive/2008/06/26/designing-applications-for-high-performance-part-iii.aspx
NOTE(rsc): This is probably safe to do always, but when enabled it chooses different encodings than the old cmd/internal/obj/i386 code did, which breaks our "same bits out" checks.
Normally the enforced limit on pointer maps is 16 bytes, but larger ones are acceptable, 33 bytes isn't too too big, and it's easier to generate a pointer bitmap than a GC program.
Note that even though package-level functions are declared in the package scope, the function scopes are embedded in the file scope of the file containing the function declaration.
Note that the tool does not check every possible problem and depends on unreliable heuristics so it should be used as guidance only, not as a firm indicator of program correctness.
Setting the high bit in handoff means that the profiling is over, and the goroutine is now in charge of flushing the data left in the hash table to the log and returning that data.
The prototypes are marked by lines beginning with "//sys" and read like func declarations if //sys is replaced by func, but: The parameter lists must give a name for each argument.
The working directory in Plan 9 is effectively per P, so different goroutines and even the same goroutine as it's rescheduled on different Ps can see different working directories.
These methods return float64 because the dominant use case is for printing a floating point number like 1.5s, and a truncation to integer would make them not useful in those cases.
TrailerPrefix is a magic prefix for ResponseWriter.Header map keys that, if present, signals that the map entry is actually for the response trailers, and not the response headers.
Use of this source code is governed by a BSD-style license that can be found in the LICENSE file Test that structures pack densely, according to the alignment of the largest field.
Walk iterates over fields of a structure and calls f with a reference to that field, the name of the field and a tag ("", "domain", "ipv4", "ipv6") specifying particular encodings.
We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are assumed by the product vendor.
We took care of 1-word and 2-word objects above, so this is at least a 6-word object, so our start bits are shared only with the type bits of another object, not with its mark bit.
determine initialization order by removing the highest priority node (the one with the fewest dependencies) and its edges from the graph, repeatedly, until there are no nodes left.
http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man5/resolv.conf.5 "If the lookup keyword is not used in the system's resolv.conf file then the assumed order is 'bind file'"
if the evaluation of *np would be affected by the assignments in all up to but not including the ith assignment, copy into a temporary during *early and replace *np with that temp.
Because it's racy, we skip this test in short mode, and then retry it several times with an increasing sleep in between our final write (via srv.Close below) and the following read.
Being live all the way to the start of the entry block prevents other values from being allocated to the same slot and clobbering the input value before we have a chance to load it.
Every time we expand a function we generate a new set of tmpnames, PAUTO's in the calling functions, and link them off of the PPARAM's, PAUTOS and PPARAMOUTs of the called function.
Finally, what if there is a variant in which 66 is a mandatory prefix rather than an operand size override, but we know of no corresponding F2/F3 form, and we see both F2/F3 and 66.
Hashing algorithm inspired by xxhash: https://code.google.com/p/xxhash/ cityhash: https://code.google.com/p/cityhash/ +build amd64 amd64p32 arm64 mips64 mips64le ppc64 ppc64le s390x
If an attacker can cause this function to run repeatedly and learn whether each instance returned an error then they can decrypt and forge signatures as if they had the private key.
If the previous sizeclass chose the same allocation size and fit the same number of objects into the page, we might as well use just this size instead of having two different sizes.
In practice, this means that we make the fast path run through entersyscall doing no-split things, and the slow path has to use systemstack to run bigger things on the system stack.
Leaf is the parsed form of the leaf certificate, which may be initialized using x509.ParseCertificate to reduce per-handshake processing for TLS clients doing client authentication.
NOTE: OLABEL is treated as a separate statement, not a separate prefix, so skipping to the last statement in the block handles the labeled statement case by skipping over the label.
Run catching the signal rather than the tRunner as a separate goroutine to avoid adding a goroutine during the sequential phase as this pollutes the stacktrace output when aborting.
Strictly speaking, there is no guarantee that seeing the error at completed:1 (at the end of the file) means we've seen all the errors from earlier in the file, but usually it does.
TODO: Unfortunate cases Non-ideal error message: Since we're looking for Lock methods, sync.Once's underlying sync.Mutex gets called out, but without any reference to the sync.Once.
Test cases assume a lookup of the form a.f or x.f, where a stands for an addressable value, and x for a non-addressable value (even though a variable for ease of test case writing).
That should be impossible, but if it does happen then we end up trying to build the same package twice, usually in parallel overwriting the same files, which doesn't work very well.
The actual representation is not copied, but the name space of associated templates is, so further calls to Parse in the copy will add templates to the copy but not to the original.
The code makes use of the fact that the zero value for a heap bitmap has no live pointer bit set and is (depending on position), not used, not checkmarked, and is the dead encoding.
The function oclass in span.c computes the specific Ytype of an operand and then the set of more general Ytypes that it satisfies is implied by the ycover table, set up in instinit.
The methods operating on spans all require that h has been returned by heapBitsForSpan and that size, n, total are the span layout description returned by the mspan's layout method.

This is not technically the Solaris semantics for abstract Unix domain sockets -- they are supposed to be uninterpreted fixed-size binary blobs -- but everyone uses this convention.
Translate rewrites f.AST, the original Go input, to remove references to the imported package C, replacing them with references to the equivalent Go types, functions, and variables.
We can't hope for the best and do it anyway, like on Darwin, because Solaris might eventually allocate a constant with a different meaning for the value of TCP_KEEPINTVL on illumos.
When compiling multiple packages or a single non-main package, build compiles the packages but discards the resulting object, serving only as a check that the packages can be built.
WriteRune appends the UTF-8 encoding of Unicode code point r to the buffer, returning its length and an error, which is always nil but is included to match bufio.Writer's WriteRune.
clip clips r against each image's bounds (after translating into the destination image's coordinate space) and shifts the points sp and mp by the same amount as the change in r.Min.
decode is like Decode but returns an additional 'end' value, which indicates if end-of-message padding or a partial quantum was encountered and thus any additional data is an error.
generate .tbss section (except for OpenBSD where it's not supported) for dynamic internal linker or external linking, so that various binutils could correctly calculate PT_TLS size.
go:cgo_import_dynamic libc_Getpgid getpgid "libc.so" go:cgo_import_dynamic libc_Getpgrp getpgrp "libc.so" go:linkname libc_Getpgid libc_Getpgid go:linkname libc_Getpgrp libc_Getpgrp
spec: "The blank identifier, represented by the underscore character _, may be used in a declaration like any other identifier but the declaration does not introduce a new binding."
A lead comment is a comment group that starts and ends in a line without any other tokens and that is followed by a non-comment token on the line immediately after the comment group.
A test should call runPending if it wants to make sure that it is not running in parallel with earlier tests, or if it has some other reason for needing the earlier tests to be done.
Additionally, concurrent handshake and application data flow is not permitted so renegotiation can only be used with protocols that synchronise with the renegotiation, such as HTTPS.
Complex subexpressions (e.g. involving quantifiers) are not safe to factor because that collapses their distinct paths through the automaton, which affects correctness in some cases.
Empty but non-nil maps are sent, so if the receiver has not allocated one already, one will always be allocated on receipt unless the transmitted map is nil and not at the top level.
Fields splits the slice s around each instance of one or more consecutive white space characters, returning a slice of subslices of s or an empty list if s contains only white space.
Filenames containing a certificate and matching private key for the server must be provided if neither the Server's TLSConfig.Certificates nor TLSConfig.GetCertificate are populated.
If the program was started with SIGHUP or SIGINT ignored, and Notify is called for either signal, a signal handler will be installed for that signal and it will no longer be ignored.
Most of these have no checks because a real memory reference follows, and the offset is small enough that if x is nil, the address will still be in the first unmapped page of memory.
Okay to round down (truncate) if lower has a different digit or if lower is inclusive and is exactly the result of rounding down (i.e., and we have reached the final digit of lower).
RFC 2616 neither explicitly permits nor forbids an entity-body on a GET request so we permit one if declared, but we default to 0 here (not -1 below) if there's no mention of a body.
Reader, to read numeric response code lines, key: value headers, lines wrapped with leading spaces on continuation lines, and whole text blocks ending with a dot on a line by itself.
Some regexps can be analyzed to determine that they never need backtracking: they are guaranteed to run in one pass over the string without bothering to save all the usual NFA state.
The GIF89a spec, Section 23 (Graphic Control Extension) says: "The scope of this extension is the first graphic rendering block to follow." We therefore reset the GCE fields to zero.
The GNU libopcodes rule, which we implement only in gnuCompat mode, is that F3 beats F2 unless F3 has no special meaning, in which case F3 can be a modified on an F2 special meaning.
These are required to work: according to the Go spec, the internal float mantissa must be at least 256 bits, and these expressions can be represented exactly with a 256-bit mantissa.
This saves the TOC in the TOC save slot, reads the function pointer from x's .plt slot and calls it like any other global entry point (including setting r12 to the function address).
Thus, if we have a named pointer type, proceed with the underlying pointer type but discard the result if it is a method since we would not have found it for T (see also issue 8590).
Unfortunately (and necessarily) morestack is called before the function that calls it sets up its frame and so the PLT ends up smashing the saved TOC pointer for its caller's caller.
We tried using special assignment functions invoked only when not holding a running P, but then some updates to a particular memory word went through write barriers and some did not.
You can do this by setting the CC_FOR_TARGET environment variable when building the toolchain using make.bash, or by setting the CC environment variable any time you run the go tool.
create_user_ns in the kernel (see https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/kernel/user_namespace.c) forbids the creation of user namespaces when chrooted.
don't overwrite any pending comment in the p.comment cache (there may be a pending comment when a line comment is immediately followed by a lead comment with no other tokens between)
zcse does an initial pass of common-subexpression elimination on the function for values with zero arguments to allow the more expensive cse to begin with a reduced number of values.
(The types also distinguish functions from global variables.) If using a standard gcc, cgo can parse the DWARF debug information for the __cgo_enum__N to learn the identifier's value.
* If the XML element contains a sub-element that hasn't matched any of the above rules and the struct has a field with tag ",any", unmarshal maps the sub-element to that struct field.
After emitting the mandatory debug_abbrev section, it calls writelines() to set up the per-compilation unit part of the DIE tree, while simultaneously emitting the debug_line section.
As a special case, if a variable s is of struct type and f is a field within that struct, then Alignof(s.f) will return the required alignment of a field of that type within a struct.
Because the translations are unexported, a Go package should not expose C types in its exported API: a C type used in one Go package is different from the same C type used in another.
By sleeping, we increase the chances that the client sees our FIN and processes its final data before they process the subsequent RST from closing a connection with known unread data.
Clients that require high-performance serialization, especially for large data structures, should look at more advanced solutions such as the encoding/gob package or protocol buffers.
Doing anything on exit is a problem because sometimes functions exit via panic instead of an ordinary return, so panic would have to know to do the same math when unwinding the stack.
Go spec: The scope of a constant or variable identifier declared inside a function begins at the end of the ConstSpec or VarSpec and ends at the end of the innermost containing block.
If a solution is found, solve prints the board after each move in a backward fashion (i.e., the last board position is printed first, all the way back to the starting board position).
Linux introduced getdents64 syscall for N64 ABI only in 3.10 (May 21 2013, rev dec33abaafc89bcbd78f85fad0513170415a26d5), to support older kernels, we have to use getdents for mips64.
Make sure PT_LOAD is aligned properly and that there is no gap, correct ELF loaders will do this implicitly, but buggy ELF loaders like the one in some versions of QEMU and UPX won't.
Most synthesized routines have different cases for constants vs variables and even the generated code has different cases for large and small constants, so try a good range of inputs.
Note that we currently count allocations during GC as both scannable heap (heap_scan) and scan work completed (scanWork), so this difference won't be changed by allocations during GC.
Otherwise, in a full handshake, if we don't have any certificates configured then we will never send a CertificateVerify message and thus no signatures are needed in that case either.
R_ADDRPOWER_TOCREL relocates two D-form instructions like R_ADDRPOWER, but inserts the offset from the TOC to the address of the the relocated symbol rather than the symbol's address.
Replicated copies are not as nice: if there is an array of objects with scalar tails, all but the last tail does have to be initialized, because there is no way to say "skip forward".
SetTracebackEnv is like runtime/debug.SetTraceback, but it raises the "environment" traceback level, so later calls to debug.SetTraceback (e.g., from testing timeouts) can't lower it.
Since we have previously verified that a frame's component identifiers (C_i values in section B.2.2) are unique, it suffices to check that the implicit indexes into d.comp are unique.
TODO(bradfitz): We could be more efficient here and either provide a method to take an existing Stmt (created on perhaps a different Conn), and re-create it on this Conn if necessary.
The number of output bytes in the last fragment is the number of leftover input bytes - 1: the extra byte provides enough bits to cover the inefficiency of the encoding for the block.
The runtime/debug package's SetTraceback function allows increasing the amount of output at run time, but it cannot reduce the amount below that specified by the environment variable.
This breaks the case of a thread created in C that calls sigaltstack and then calls a Go function, because we will lose track of the C code's sigaltstack, but it's the best we can do.
This so-called leftmost-first matching is the same semantics that Perl, Python, and other implementations use, although this package implements it without the expense of backtracking.
This tests that the package associated with the types.Object.Pkg method is the type's package independent of the order in which the imports are listed in the sources src1, src2 below.
Using compare-and-swap to pop from the stack has ABA races, so we simulate a lock by doing an exchange (via casp) to steal the stack head and replace the top pointer with MLOCKED (1).
With the textual export format, the list may also include additional packages that are not strictly required for import processing alone (they are exported to err "on the safe side").
don't trace bexpr - only leads to overly nested trace output prec is precedence of the prior/enclosing binary operator (if any), so we only want to parse tokens of greater precedence.
processLog verifies whether the given ThreadSanitizer's log contains a race report, checks this information against the name of the testcase and returns the result of this comparison.
Architectures that use a link register save its value on the stack in the function prologue and so always have a pointer between the hardware stack pointer and the local variable area.
At some future point we might be able to avoid this round-about way and create the rewritten nodes directly, possibly avoiding a lot of duplicate work (name resolution, type checking).
Callers that create an Encoder and then invoke EncodeToken directly, without using Encode, need to call Flush when finished to ensure that the JSON is written to the underlying writer.
Calling UnreadByte after ReadLine will always unread the last byte read (possibly a character belonging to the line end) even if that byte is not part of the line returned by ReadLine.
Catch this by making assertE2I2 call runtime.GC, which will force a stack scan and failure if there are bad pointers, and then fill the stack with bad pointers and run the type switch.
For example: - the public suffix of "example.com" is "com", - the public suffix of "foo1.foo2.foo3.co.uk" is "co.uk", and - the public suffix of "bar.pvt.k12.ma.us" is "pvt.k12.ma.us".
From the time the second goroutine is created, at least one of c1 and c2 is always ready for receiving, so the select in the second goroutine must always receive from one or the other.
In other words, if there's exactly one operand that - after type-checking by calling get - stands for multiple operands, the resulting getter provides access to those operands instead.
In the most simple case, if the type of the value from the source column is an integer, bool or string type T and dest is of type *T, Scan simply assigns the value through the pointer.
Instead we map the memory information bitmap immediately after the data segment, large enough to handle another 2GB of mappings (256 MB), along with a reservation for an initial arena.
It does not initialize them first, so if the destination is a compound value such as a map, struct, or slice, the decoded values will be merged elementwise into the existing variables.
Now that they've read from the unbuffered channel, they're safely out of the select that also waits on this goroutine to die, so we're allowed to exit now if needed (if alive is false)
The recursive-descent parser is built around a slighty modified grammar of Go to accommodate for the constraints imposed by strict one token look- ahead, and for better error handling.
This makes it possible for a single UDP listener to join multiple different group addresses, for multiple UDP listeners that listen on the same UDP port to join the same group address.
We check off first because we're more likely to have multiple entries with different offsets for the same targetpc than the other way around, so we'll usually fail in the first clause.
We want a small integral part in the result because finding digits of an integer requires divisions, whereas digits of the fractional part can be found by repeatedly multiplying by 10.
Without synchronization, the initialization writes and the "publication" write may be reordered, allowing the other processor to follow the pointer and observe an uninitialized object.
ok to filter these methods early because any conflicting method will be filtered here, too - thus, removing these methods early will not lead to the false removal of possible conflicts
other constants, like big integers or floating point constants, require a mov into a register, so those might as well go on the left, so we can reuse that register for the computation.
ErrContentLength is returned by ResponseWriter.Write calls when a Handler set a Content-Length response header with a declared size and then attempted to write more bytes than declared.
Heuristic: indentList returns true if there are more than one multi- line element in the list, or if there is any element that is not starting on the same line as the previous one ends.
If DIR is a directory listed in the GOPATH, a package with source in DIR/src/foo/bar can be imported as "foo/bar" and has its compiled form installed to "DIR/pkg/GOOS_GOARCH/foo/bar.a".
In Go 1.1 and earlier, each function (represented by a Func) had its own LineTable, and the line number corresponded to a numbering of all source lines in the program, across all files.
In this way, all supported systems use identical instructions to access TLS, and they are rewritten appropriately first here in liblink and then finally using relocations in the linker.
It is tempting to try to save the m for next time, which would eliminate both these costs, but there might not be a next time: the current thread (which Go does not control) might exit.
So now that we have a consistent trace, test that (1) parser does not return a logical error in case of broken timestamps and (2) broken timestamps are eventually detected and reported.
So we need to make sure that values do not have mismatched bracket or quote characters to prevent the browser from restarting parsing inside a string that might embed JavaScript source.
That is, when matching against text, the regexp returns a match that begins as early as possible in the input (leftmost), and among those it chooses a match that is as long as possible.
The typ+val+flag bits describe the receiver r, but the flag's Kind bits say Func (methods are functions), and the top bits of the flag give the method number in r's type's method table.
This choice means that such a time can be parsed and reformatted with the same layout losslessly, but the exact instant used in the representation will differ by the actual zone offset.
This makes the output look a little nicer when debugging, and some kind of space is required if the encoded value was a number, so that the reader knows there aren't more digits coming.
This may race with adding the first special to a span, but in that case addfinalizer will observe that the GC is active (which is globally synchronized) and ensure the above invariants.
This test could only test Go version of expandKey because asm version might use different memory layout for expanded keys This is OK because we don't expose expanded keys to the outside
To send an interface, we send a string identifying the concrete type, followed by the type identifier (which might require defining that type right now), followed by the concrete value.
Use of this source code is governed by a BSD-style license that can be found in the LICENSE file.h Package httptrace provides mechanisms to trace the events within HTTP client requests.
all is the scope of all declared labels, parent the set of labels declared in the immediately enclosing block, and lstmt is the labeled statement this block is associated with (or nil).
an untyped non-constant argument may appear if it contains a (yet untyped non-constant) shift expression: convert it to complex128 which will result in an error (shift of complex value)
gcController implements the GC pacing controller that determines when to trigger concurrent garbage collection and how much marking work to do in mutator assists and background marking.
Although leading space characters (space, tab, carriage return, newline) at the beginning of src are dropped, trailing space characters at the end of src are preserved and copied to dst.
Code should use context.TODO when it's unclear which Context to use or it is not yet available (because the surrounding function has not yet been extended to accept a Context parameter).
Creating a slice causes the runtime to repeat a bitmap, which exercises a different path from making the compiler repeat a bitmap for a small array or executing a repeat in a GC program.
Executing write barriers on p is complicated in the general case because we either need to unwind the stack to get the stack map, or we need the type's bitmap, which may be a GC program.
For backwards compatibility, a zero-valued Config is valid to pass to EncodeAll, and implies that the overall GIF's width and height equals the first frame's bounds' Rectangle.Max point.
For large types containing arrays, the type information has a natural repetition that can be encoded to save space in the binary and in the memory representation of the type information.
For unknown reasons, if the addr16 prefix is repeated, libopcodes displays all but the last as addr32, even though the addressing form used in a memory reference is clearly still 16-bit.
If maxOpen is significantly larger than connectionRequestQueueSize then it is possible for ALL calls into the *DB to block until the connectionOpener can satisfy the backlog of requests.
If the certificate_authorities list is empty then the client MAY send any certificate of the appropriate ClientCertificateType, unless there is some external arrangement to the contrary.
If the path down from rcheck dereferences the address (possibly with a small offset) before writing to memory and before any subsequent checks, it's okay to wait for that implicit check.
It is designed such that only a minimal amount of work needs to be done in the common ASCII case (one test to check for both ASCII and end-of-buffer, and one test to check for newlines).
See the Go compatibility document for background: https://golang.org/doc/go1compat See "Gobs of data" for a design discussion of the gob wire format: https://blog.golang.org/gobs-of-data
Symbols with only file visibility (such as file-level static declarations in C) have a non-zero version distinguishing a symbol in one file from a symbol of the same name in another file
Tests that the server flushes its response headers out when it's ignoring the response body and waits a bit before forcefully closing the TCP connection, causing the client to get a RST.
The resulting Client object has two methods, Call and Go, that specify the service and method to call, a pointer containing the arguments, and a pointer to receive the result parameters.
The sigprof handler must read the instruction at the current PC and if it was the known instruction (for example, JMP BX or MOV R2, PC), use that other register in place of the PC value.
There can only be one allocation from a given span active at a time, so this code is not racing with other instances of itself, and the bitmap for a span always falls on byte boundaries.
They implement the Go rules for comparison of values, except that size and exact type are ignored, so any integer value, signed or unsigned, may be compared with any other integer value.
This does not affect valid PNG images that contain multiple IDAT chunks, since the first call to parseIDAT below will consume all consecutive IDAT chunks required for decoding the image.
This must NOT be go:noescape: if fn is a stack-allocated closure, fn puts g on a run queue, and g executes before fn returns, the closure will be invalidated while it is still executing.
arm and amd64 distinguish between moves that moves that *must* sign/zero extend and moves that don't care so they can eliminate moves that don't care without breaking moves that do care.
otherwise ignore the method TODO(gri): There may be exported methods of non-exported types that can be called because of exported values (consts, vars, or function results) of that type.
variable name conventions: ohv1, hv1, hv2: hidden (old) val 1, 2 ha, hit: hidden aggregate, iterator hn, hp: hidden len, pointer hb: hidden bool a, v1, v2: not hidden aggregate, val 1, 2
2) Otherwise, if there are transition times, and the first transition is to a zone in daylight time, find the first non-daylight-time zone before and closest to the first transition zone.
A fractional second is represented by adding a period and zeros to the end of the seconds section of layout string, as in "15:04:05.000" to format a time stamp with millisecond precision.
Because a complit type may be a qualified identifier which is handled by pexpr (together with selector expressions), complits are parsed there as well (operand is only called from pexpr).
Because these interfaces and primitives wrap lower-level operations with various implementations, unless otherwise informed clients should not assume they are safe for parallel execution.
DisableCompression, if true, prevents the Transport from requesting compression with an "Accept-Encoding: gzip" request header when the Request contains no existing Accept-Encoding value.
For android, we use a disgusting hack that assumes the thread-local storage slot for g is allocated using pthread_key_create with a fixed offset (see src/runtime/cgo/gcc_android_amd64.c).
For each input address, addr2line prints two output lines, first the name of the function containing the address and second the file:line of the source code corresponding to that address.
How handlers set Trailers: declare it ahead of time with the Trailer header, and then mutate the Header() of those values later, after the response has been written (we wrote to w above).
If the command name does not include a file extension, the shell adds the extensions listed in the PATHEXT environment variable, one by one, and searches the directory for that file name.
Instead of figuring out how to emit the write barriers missing in the assembly manipulation, we change the type of the field to uintptr, so that it does not require write barriers at all.
It's often the case that PEM encoded CRLs will appear where they should be DER encoded, so this function will transparently handle PEM encoding as long as there isn't any leading garbage.
Omitting N bytes ...' message, then the ring buffer suffix, and just rearrange the ring buffer suffix when Bytes() is called, but it doesn't seem worth it for now just for error messages.
The code encompassed by a Rgn is defined by the flow graph, starting at enter, flood-filling forward while varno is refahead and backward while varno is refbehind, and following branches.
The global work list is empty, but there can still be work sitting in the per-P work caches and there can be more objects reachable from global roots since they don't have write barriers.
The register optimizer has been changed to respect the same "address taken" flag that the liveness analysis uses, even if it cannot see any address being taken in the actual machine code.
The result of getcallersp is correct at the time of the return, but it may be invalidated by any subsequent call to a function that might relocate the stack in order to grow or shrink it.
The values of these bits should be considered part of the public API and may be used in wire protocols or disk representations: they must not be changed, although new bits might be added.
There is a lookup table of a fixed bit width (huffmanChunkBits), For codes smaller than the table width, there are multiple entries (each combination of trailing bits has the same value).
Vendor directories do not affect the placement of new repositories being checked out for the first time by 'go get': those are always placed in the main GOPATH, never in a vendor subtree.
When calling Encode instead of EncodeAll, the single-frame image is translated such that its top-left corner is (0, 0), so that the single frame completely fills the overall GIF's bounds.
no comment text on the first line: reduce prefix by up to 3 blanks or a tab if present - this keeps comment text indented relative to the /* and */'s if it was indented in the first place
raisebadsignal is called when a signal is received on a non-Go thread, and the Go program does not want to handle it (that is, the program has not called os/signal.Notify for the signal).
runtime.callbackasm is just a series of CALL instructions (each is 5 bytes long), and we want callback to arrive at correspondent call instruction instead of start of runtime.callbackasm.
srcref: src file referring to package objref: object file referring to package file: object file, e.g., /home/rsc/go/pkg/container/vector.a pkg: package import path, e.g. container/vector
A writeRequest is sent by the readLoop's goroutine to the writeLoop's goroutine to write a request while the read loop concurrently waits on both the write response and the server's reply.
Check that Parse (and ParseInLocation) understand that Feb 01 AST (Arabia Standard Time) and Feb 01 AST (Atlantic Standard Time) are in different time zones even though both are called AST
Determine the white space on the first line after the /* and before the beginning of the comment text, assume two blanks instead of the /* unless the first character after the /* is a tab.
For stream and datagram listeners, they will only require named sockets, so we can assume that it's just a request from stream or datagram listeners when laddr is not nil but raddr is nil.
If returnImports is true and name denotes a Go program, matchFile reads until the end of the imports (and returns that data) even though it only considers text until the first non-comment.
If there is any kind of logical race with that blocked thread (e.g. it has already returned from netpoll, but does not set lastpoll yet), this thread will do blocking netpoll below anyway.
In general, reflect.SliceHeader and reflect.StringHeader should be used only as *reflect.SliceHeader and *reflect.StringHeader pointing at actual slices or strings, never as plain structs.
It is a variant of R_ADDROFF used when linking from the uncommonType of a rtype, and may be set to zero by the linker if it determines the method text is unreachable by the linked program.
It's preferable to choose WriterTo over ReaderFrom, since a WriterTo can issue one large write, while the ReaderFrom must read until EOF, potentially allocating when running out of buffer.
MarshalIndent works like Marshal, but each XML element begins on a new indented line that starts with prefix and is followed by one or more copies of indent according to the nesting depth.
That means choosing a year equal to 1 mod 400, so that the first leap year is the 4th year, the first missed leap year is the 100th year, and the missed missed leap year is the 400th year.
The compiler ensures that writes through up-pointers have an accompanying write barrier (it simply doesn't distinguish between writes through up-pointers and writes through heap pointers).
The returned slice points to shared data that may be overwritten by the next call to Token, a call to a Scan function using the ScanState as input, or when the calling Scan method returns.
The table is a sequence of (value, pc) pairs, where each pair states that the given value is in effect from the current position up to the given pc, which becomes the new current position.
This is called out as a special case primarily for 32-bit systems, so that on 32-bit systems the code below can assume all objects are 4-word aligned (because they're all 16-byte aligned).
This is responsible for maintaining the same GC-related invariants as markrootSpans in any situation where it's possible that markrootSpans has already run but mark termination hasn't yet.
This typically happens on file systems with 1-second (or, worse, 2-second) mtime granularity and with automated scripts that write an input and then immediately run a build, or vice versa.
To detect changes in toolchain, we include the toolchain version in the build ID hash for package runtime, and then we include the build IDs of all imported packages in the build ID for p.
We compute the actual heap growth during this cycle and scale that by how far off from the goal CPU utilization we were (to estimate the heap growth if we had the desired CPU utilization).
We need to balance between keeping enough running worker threads to utilize available hardware parallelism and parking excessive running worker threads to conserve CPU resources and power.
We need to take care with errors on both DNS message exchange layer and DNS transport layer because goLookupIP may fail when the IP connectivty on node under test gets lost during its run.
(This encoding ignores the mod bits.) The decoder sees the non-register mod and reads farther ahead to decode the memory reference that isn't really there, causing the size to be too large.
(Typically the block is bigger than sizeof(MLink).) Since assignments to mlink.next will result in a write barrier being performed this cannot be used by some of the internal GC structures.
Between background workers and assists, we don't really know how many workers there will be, so we pretend to have an arbitrarily large number of workers, almost all of which are "waiting".
Execution of the template walks the structure and sets the cursor, represented by a period '.' and called "dot", to the value at the current location in the structure as execution proceeds.
For example, a goroutine was unblocked on a mutex, but another goroutine got ahead and acquired the mutex before the first goroutine is scheduled, so the first goroutine has to block again.
Glibc instead only uses CommonPrefixLen for IPv4 when the source and destination addresses are on the same subnet, but that requires extra work to find the netmask for our source addresses.
If an input file changes after being read but before the object is written, the next build will see an object newer than the input and will incorrectly decide that the object is up to date.
In certain cases, all of which require a memory destination, the REPN and REP prefixes are interpreted as XACQUIRE and XRELEASE from the Intel Transactional Synchroniation Extensions (TSX).
In general we'd need an atomic update here if the concurrent GC were marking objects in this span, because each bitmap byte describes 3 other objects in addition to the one being allocated.
Sibling returns a sibling of x in the dominator tree (i.e., a node with the same immediate dominator) or nil if there are no remaining siblings in the arbitrary but repeatable order chosen.
Some parts are a bit tedious, but overall it nicely factors out the otherwise common code from the multiple scanning functions in this package (Compact, Indent, checkValid, nextValue, etc).
These objects are the full representation of the package's API, and they are the only information a platform-independent tool (e.g., go/types) needs to know to type-check against a package.
This was generated by starting with a 2MB JSON file with actual data about open source revision history, then compressing with bzip2 -9, then encoding to base64 with openssl enc -e -base64.
When growing the table, iterators remain iterating through the old table and must check the new table if the bucket they are iterating through has been moved ("evacuated") to the new table.
assemblyPerSourceLine disassembles the binary containing a symbol and classifies the assembly instructions according to its corresponding source line, annotating them with a set of samples.
big.Word size in bits The following methods are extracted from math/big to make this a stand-alone program that can easily be run without dependencies and compiled with different compilers.
sigmask represents a general signal mask compatible with the GOOS specific sigset types: the signal numbered x is represented by bit x-1 to match the representation expected by sigprocmask.
(The arithmetic value is compared, not the bit pattern, so all negative integers are less than all unsigned integers.) However, as usual, one may not compare an int with a float32 and so on.
An unused data size override should probably be shown, to distinguish DATA16 CRC32B from plain CRC32B, but libopcodes always treats the final override as implicit and the others as explicit.
Because ReadRune is implemented by the interface, Read should never be called by the scanning routines and a valid implementation of ScanState may choose always to return an error from Read.
Darwin external linker on arm64 and on amd64 and arm in c-shared/c-archive buildmode complains about absolute relocs in __TEXT, so if the section is not executable, put it in __DATA segment.
Go spec: A short variable declaration may redeclare variables provided they were originally declared in the same block with the same type, and at least one of the non-blank variables is new.
If there are multiple fields at the same level, and that level is the least nested (and would therefore be the nesting level selected by the usual Go rules), the following extra rules apply:
In contrast to io.LimitReader, MaxBytesReader's result is a ReadCloser, returns a non-EOF error for a Read beyond the limit, and closes the underlying reader when its Close method is called.
In particular, it implements LZW as used by the GIF and PDF file formats, which means variable-width codes up to 12 bits and the first two non-literal codes are a clear code and an EOF code.
In this case, Wait does not complete until the goroutine stops copying, either because it has reached the end of Stdin (EOF or a read error) or because writing to the pipe returned an error.
Internal and External Linking The text above describes "internal" linking, in which cmd/link parses and links host object files (ELF, Mach-O, PE, and so on) into the final executable itself.
Must do now instead of below because the any/all calculation requires walking forward over the block (as this loop does), while the liveout requires walking backward (as the next loop does).
Normally we shy away from making implicit arguments explicit, following the Intel manuals, but adding the arguments seems the best way to express the effect of the segment override prefixes.
On amd64p32, the beginning of return values is 64-bit aligned, so the caller's frame layout (which doesn't have a receiver) is different from the layout of the fn call, which has a receiver.
Rewrite the ELF header to set shnum to 0, so that we can pass the data to elf.NewFile and it will decode the Prog list but not try to read the section headers and the string table from disk.
TODO: implements short string optimization on non amd64 platforms and get rid of strings_amd64.go Index returns the index of the first instance of sep in s, or -1 if sep is not present in s.
The original implementation here was a true queue (using a channel) but it had the effect of getting distracted by low-level leaf actions to the detriment of completing higher-level actions.
The updateExprType method is used to record this final type and update the recorded types: the type-checked expression tree is again traversed down, and the new type is propagated as needed.
These are AWORDS because there is no (afaict) way to generate the addis instruction except as part of the load of a large constant, and in that case there is no way to use r12 as the source.
To make sure that the runtime's chansend can call typeBitsBulkBarrier, we raised the limit to 2048, so that even 32-bit systems are guaranteed to use bitmaps for objects up to 64 kB in size.
We can set it to the current value of wait because any previous waiters are already in the list or will notice that they have already been notified when trying to add themselves to the list.
We pad the bytes we want decoded with enough 0x5Fs that no matter what state the instruction stream is in after reading our bytes, the pops will get us back to a forced instruction boundary.
When parsing a time with a zone offset like -0700, if the offset corresponds to a time zone used by the current location (Local), then Parse uses that location and zone in the returned time.
When parsing, if the seconds value is followed by a decimal point and some digits, that is taken as a fraction of a second even if the layout string does not represent the fractional second.
decode1 is the implementation of Decode but takes an extra gnuCompat flag to cause it to change its behavior to mimic bugs (or at least unique features) of GNU libopcodes as used by objdump.
heapBitsSetType requires that allocSize is a multiple of 4 words, so that the relevant bitmap bytes are not shared with surrounding objects and need not be accessed with atomic instructions.
now total number of bits to copy If the number of bits being repeated is small, load them into a register and use that register for the entire loop instead of repeatedly reading from memory.
pragmaFields is similar to strings.FieldsFunc(s, isSpace) but does not split when inside double quoted regions and always splits before the start and after the end of a double quoted region.
progress counter for evacuation (buckets less than this have been evacuated) If both key and value do not contain pointers and are inline, then we mark bucket type as containing no pointers.
By default, cmd/link will present the same interface it does today: cmd/link main.a produces a file named a.out, even if cmd/link does so by invoking the host linker in external linking mode.
Calling GoroutineProfile twice in a row should find the same number of goroutines, but it's possible there are goroutines just about to exit, so we might end up with fewer in the second call.
Each time analyze is called with a list of functions, every function on that list only calls other functions on the list or functions that have been passed in previous invocations of analyze.
Even if a uintptr holds the address of some object, the garbage collector will not update that uintptr's value if the object moves, nor will that uintptr keep the object from being reclaimed.
For a gif.GIF, the overall bounds' top-left point is always implicitly (0, 0), and any frame whose bounds have a negative X or Y will be outside those overall bounds, so encoding should fail.
GO_RESULTS_INITIALIZED indicates that the assembly function has initialized the stack space for its results and that those results should be considered live for the remainder of the function.
If a subtree has been registered and a request is received naming the subtree root without its trailing slash, ServeMux redirects that request to the subtree root (adding the trailing slash).
If the exponent is too small, we have a denormal number before rounding and fewer than p mantissa bits of precision available (the exponent remains fixed but the mantissa gets shifted right).
If we're sending a non-chunked HTTP/1.1 response without a content-length, the only way to do that is the old HTTP/1.0 way, by noting the EOF with a connection close, so we need to set Close.
Moreover, the Data field is not sufficient to guarantee the data it references will not be garbage collected, so programs must keep a separate, correctly typed pointer to the underlying data.
On the one hand we don't want to retake Ps if there is no other work to do, but on the other hand we want to retake them eventually because they can prevent the sysmon thread from deep sleep.
The compiler should work w/o any loss of functionality with the flag disabled, but the generated code will lose access to inlined function bodies across packages, leading to performance bugs.
The first word in the entry is an index into what DWARF calls the ``abbreviation table.''  An abbreviation is really just a type descriptor: it's an array of attribute tag/value format pairs.
This breaks the write barrier shadow checking mode, and it is also scary: better to have a word that is completely ignored by the GC than to have one for which only a few updates are ignored.
This really doesn't have much to do with escape analysis per se, but we are reusing the ability to annotate an individual function argument and pass those annotations along to importing code.
Thus, the merging goroutine will receive from 'primes' much slower than this goroutine will send to it, making the buffer accumulate and block this goroutine from sending, causing a deadlock.
When linking a shared object, some conceptually "read only" types need to be written to by relocations and putting them in a section called ".rodata" interacts poorly with the system linkers.
common case: single declaration w/o parentheses (if a single declaration is parenthesized, create a new fake declaration below, so that go/doc type declarations always appear w/o parentheses)
determine element size: all bets are off if we don't have position information for the previous and next token (likely generated code - simply ignore the size in this case by setting it to 0)
downloadCache records the import paths we have already considered during the download, to avoid duplicate work when there is more than one dependency sequence leading to a particular package.
A variable's scope extends to the "end" action of the control structure ("if", "with", or "range") in which it is declared, or to the end of the template if there is no such control structure.
An alternate solution might be to split the cmd.Run into separate cmd.Start and cmd.Wait, and then use an RWLock to make sure that copyFile only executes when no cmd.Start call is in progress.
If sub.Go.Name is "_Ctype_struct_foo" or "_Ctype_union_foo" or "_Ctype_class_foo", use that as the Go form for this typedef too, so that the typedef will be interchangeable with the base type.
If the Body is not closed, the Client's underlying RoundTripper (typically Transport) may not be able to re-use a persistent TCP connection to the server for a subsequent "keep-alive" request.
It is used by the http.Transport code to keep the buffering behavior for headers and trailers, but flush out chunks aggressively in the middle for request bodies which may be generated slowly.
Make sure empty body is not interpreted as no inlineable body (see also parser.fnbody) (not doing so can cause significant performance degradation due to unnecessary calls to empty functions).
On 386 PC-relative addressing (for non-call/jmp instructions) assumes that the previous instruction loaded the PC of the end of that instruction into CX, so the adjustment is relative to that.
Registration is typically automatic as a side effect of initializing that format's package so that, to decode a PNG image, it suffices to have import _ "image/png" in a program's main package.
Scanner is implemented by any value that has a Scan method, which scans the input for the representation of a value and stores the result in the receiver, which must be a pointer to be useful.
Session resumption is not allowed if renegotiating because renegotiation is primarily used to allow a client to send a client certificate, which would be skipped if session resumption occured.
This file contains the actual write barrier implementation, markwb, and the various wrappers called by the compiler to implement pointer assignment, slice assignment, typed memmove, and so on.
This shouldn't happen if we're being invoked in background mode since proportional sweep should have just finished sweeping everything, but rounding errors, etc, may leave a few spans unswept.
now, the main state generation loop first pass generates all of the states later passes fix up lookahead could be sped up a lot by remembering results of the first pass rather than recomputing
runTests assures that the package and its dependencies is built with instrumentation enabled and returns the output of 'go test' which includes possible data race reports from ThreadSanitizer.
100 Hz is a reasonable choice: it is frequent enough to produce useful data, rare enough not to bog down the system, and a nice round number to make it easy to convert sample counts to seconds.
Build a GOPATH package (depBase) into a shared library that links against the goroot runtime, another package (dep2) that links against the first, and and an executable that links against dep2.
But we need to set it before we make the span available for allocation (return it to heap or mcentral), because allocation code assumes that a span is already swept if available for allocation.
If a signal is delivered to a non-Go thread, it will act as described above, except that if there is an existing non-Go signal handler, that handler will be installed before raising the signal.
In addition to the build flags, the flags handled by 'go test' itself are: -args Pass the remainder of the command line (everything after -args) to the test binary, uninterpreted and unchanged.
Known networks are "tcp", "tcp4" (IPv4-only), "tcp6" (IPv6-only), "udp", "udp4" (IPv4-only), "udp6" (IPv6-only), "ip", "ip4" (IPv4-only), "ip6" (IPv6-only), "unix", "unixgram" and "unixpacket".
On GNU systems, we can arrange for the dynamic linker to mprotect sections after relocations are applied by giving them write permissions in the object file and calling them ".data.rel.ro.FOO".
On Linux and the BSDs (and probably Solaris), profiling signals are only generated when a process completes a whole scheduling quantum, so this test often gets zero profiling signals and fails.
Operationally, this is similar to a dot import of builtinpkg, except that we silently skip symbols that are already declared in the package block rather than emitting a redeclared symbol error.
ProxyFromEnvironment returns the URL of the proxy to use for a given request, as indicated by the environment variables HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY and NO_PROXY (or the lowercase versions thereof).
That means that if we are shifting by 4 (multiplying by 16), it will add 2 digits when the string prefix is "625" through "999", and one fewer digit if the string prefix is "000" through "624".
The consumed result tells whether XML elements have been consumed from the Decoder until start's matching end element, or if it's still untouched because start is uninteresting for sv's fields.
The output is semantically equivalent to the input as far as the user of package reflect can tell, but the true func representation can be handled by code like Convert and Interface and Assign.
The package name main is no longer reserved, but we reserve the import path "main" to identify the main package, just as we reserve the import path "math" to identify the standard math package.
The parse functions return the widest type (float64, int64, and uint64), but if the size argument specifies a narrower width the result can be converted to that narrower type without data loss:
This also implements the `single array' method from the bzip2 source code which leaves the output, still shuffled, in the bottom 8 bits of tt with the index of the next byte in the top 24-bits.
This way we have one buffer's worth of hysteresis, which amortizes the cost of getting or putting a work buffer over at least one buffer of work and reduces contention on the global work lists.
We could detect this and undo NOHUGEPAGE on the end points as well, but it's probably not worth the cost because when neighboring allocations are freed sysUnused will just set NOHUGEPAGE again.
We hope they are accurate, but we know that they fail in the case of prebuilt Go installations that don't preserve the build mtimes (for example, if the pkg/ mtimes are before the src/ mtimes).
appendIndexedName appends f and index i referring indexed name entry, as encoded in one of "Literal Header field - Indexed Name" representation variants, to dst and returns the extended buffer.
default: false forceObjFileStability enforces additional constraints in export data and other parts of the compiler to eliminate object file differences only due to the choice of export format.
equalFoldRight is a specialization of bytes.EqualFold when s is known to be all ASCII (including punctuation), but contains an 's', 'S', 'k', or 'K', requiring a Unicode fold on the bytes in t.
optional TLS config, used by ListenAndServeTLS MaxHeaderBytes controls the maximum number of bytes the server will read parsing the request header's keys and values, including the request line.
startFrameWrite starts a goroutine to write wm (in a separate goroutine since that might block on the network), and updates the serve goroutine's state about the world, updated from info in wm.
Each line is either blank, or looks like (tag: refs/tags/go1.4rc2, refs/remotes/origin/release-branch.go1.4, refs/heads/release-branch.go1.4) We need to find an element starting with refs/tags/.
For backwards compatibility for Go 1.4 and earlier code, the Config field is optional, and if zero, the width and height is implied by the first (and in this case only) frame's width and height.
Functions that can be inlined use numbered parameters so we can distingish them from other names in their context after inlining (i.e., the parameter numbering is a form of parameter rewriting).
If an Import finds and returns a package using a vendor directory, the resulting ImportPath is the complete path to the package, including the path elements leading up to and including "vendor".
If needm finds that it has taken the last m off the list, its job is - once it has installed its own m so that it can do things like allocate memory - to create a spare m and put it on the list.
On DragonFly BSD, we adjust the ephemeral port range because unlike other BSD systems its default port range doesn't conform to IANA recommendation as described in RFC 6056 and is pretty narrow.
The OID for the named curve may be provided from another source (such as the PKCS8 container) - if it is provided then use this instead of the OID that may exist in the EC private key structure.
The point of this test file is that it references a type from depBase that is also referenced in dep2, but dep2 is loaded by the linker before depBase (because it is earlier in the import list).
* If the XMLName field has an associated tag of the form "name" or "namespace-URL name", the XML element must have the given name (and, optionally, name space) or else Unmarshal returns an error.
6.9.1 The Flow Control Window "If a sender receives a WINDOW_UPDATE that causes a flow control window to exceed this maximum it MUST terminate either the stream or the connection, as appropriate.
As a courtesy to developers installing new versions of the compiler frequently, define that packages are stale if they are older than the compiler, and commands if they are older than the linker.
For example, all the packages in the code.google.com/p/codesearch repo share the same root (the directory for that path), and we only need to run the hg commands to consider each repository once.
If we were able to stop the timer, that means it was running (hadn't yet started the fallback), but we just got an error on the primary path, so start the fallback immediately (in 0 nanoseconds).
In legalese: The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied, with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.
Indent sets the encoder to generate XML in which each element begins on a new indented line that starts with prefix and is followed by one or more copies of indent according to the nesting depth.
Interface types appear first in the list, sorted topologically by dependencies on embedded interfaces that are also declared in this package, followed by all other objects sorted in source order.
Mark defer as started, but keep on list, so that traceback can find and update the defer's argument frame if stack growth or a garbage collection happens before reflectcall starts executing d.fn.
Note: An unmodified AST generated by go/parser will already contain a backward- or double-quoted path string that does not contain any invalid characters, and most of the work here is not needed.
PPARAMOUT is loop depth 0 for writes but considered loop depth 1 for address-of, so that writing the address of one result to another (or the same) result makes the first result move to the heap.
That status change by itself can be viewed as a small preemption, because the GC might change Gwaiting to Gscanwaiting, and then this goroutine has to wait for the GC to finish before continuing.
The Syscall functions in package syscall pass their uintptr arguments directly to the operating system, which then may, depending on the details of the call, reinterpret some of them as pointers.
The arguments to uintptraddr technically have an address but may not be addressable in the Go sense: for example, in the case of T(v).Field where T is a struct type and v is an addressable value.
The implementation compiles a custom codec for each data type in the stream and is most efficient when a single Encoder is used to transmit a stream of values, amortizing the cost of compilation.
The returned context's Done channel is closed when the deadline expires, when the returned cancel function is called, or when the parent context's Done channel is closed, whichever happens first.
To avoid putting the temporary output directory name there (and making the resulting shared library useless), run the link in the output directory so that -o can name just the final path element.
To create the Pos value for a specific source offset (measured in bytes), first add the respective file to the current file set using FileSet.AddFile and then call File.Pos(offset) for that file.
clearLoopCutOff is the (somewhat arbitrary) value above which it is better to have a loop of clear instructions (e.g. XCs) rather than just generating multiple instructions (i.e. loop unrolling).
(For historical reasons the meaning of skip differs between Caller and Callers.) The return values report the program counter, file name, and line number within the file of the corresponding call.
A shadowed variable is a variable declared in an inner scope with the same name and type as a variable in an outer scope, and where the outer variable is mentioned after the inner one is declared.
As a special case, if the "Content-Transfer-Encoding" header has a value of "quoted-printable", that header is instead hidden from this map and the body is transparently decoded during Read calls.
FilterDecl trims the AST for a Go declaration in place by removing all names (including struct field and interface method names, but not from parameter lists) that don't pass through the filter f.
For more details see Hacker's Delight, Chapter 10, and http://ridiculousfish.com/blog/posts/labor-of-division-episode-i.html http://ridiculousfish.com/blog/posts/labor-of-division-episode-iii.html
Generating random text: a Markov chain algorithm Based on the program presented in the "Design and Implementation" chapter of The Practice of Programming (Kernighan and Pike, Addison-Wesley 1999).
If FakeImportC is set, `import "C"` (for packages requiring Cgo) declares an empty "C" package and errors are omitted for qualified identifiers referring to package C (which won't find an object).
If an evaluation yields a function value, such as a function-valued field of a struct, the function is not invoked automatically, but it can be used as a truth value for an if action and the like.
Instead, the compiler assumes that any value whose address is taken without being immediately dereferenced needs to be moved to the heap, and new(T) and slice literals are always real allocations.
Since two case values may have the same "underlying" value but different types we need to also check the value's types (e.g., byte(1) vs myByte(1)) when the switch expression is of interface type.
TODO(brainman): add Load function, as a replacement for NewFile, that does not call removeAuxSymbols (for performance) NewFile creates a new File for accessing a PE binary in an underlying reader.
The SendMail function and the the net/smtp package are low-level mechanisms and provide no support for DKIM signing, MIME attachments (see the mime/multipart package), or other mail functionality.
The gccgo compiler had a bug: if one file in a package did a dot import, then an earlier file in the package would incorrectly resolve to the imported names rather than reporting undefined errors.
The gccgo version of TestTwoGopathShlibs: build a GOPATH package into a shared library with gccgo, another GOPATH package that depends on the first and an executable that links the second library.
There is no guarantee that finalizers will run before a program exits, so typically they are useful only for releasing non-memory resources associated with an object during a long-running program.
This is checked by root marking operations that have to happen only during the first root marking pass, whether that's during the concurrent mark phase in current GC or mark termination in STW GC.
Wait for the goroutine converting context.Done into a write timeout to exist, otherwise our caller might cancel the context and cause fd.setWriteDeadline(aLongTimeAgo) to cancel a successful dial.
comparison of an interface with a non-interface, especially in a switch on interface value with non-interface cases, is not visible to orderstmt, so we have to fall back on allocating a temp here.
fmt.Println("ip has value ", *ip) fmt.Println("flagvar has value ", flagvar) After parsing, the arguments following the flags are available as the slice flag.Args() or individually as flag.Arg(i).
opensslOutputSink is an io.Writer that receives the stdout and stderr from an `openssl` process and sends a value to handshakeComplete when it sees a log message from a completed server handshake.
Anonymous struct fields are usually marshaled as if their inner exported fields were fields in the outer struct, subject to the usual Go visibility rules amended as described in the next paragraph.
Because os.FileInfo's Name method returns only the base name of the file it describes, it may be necessary to modify the Name field of the returned header to provide the full path name of the file.
Consider the following example where the mutator writes into a slot and then loads the slot's mark bit while the GC thread writes to the slot's mark bit and then as part of scanning reads the slot.
IN PARTICULAR, NEITHER THE AUTHORS NOR LUCENT TECHNOLOGIES MAKE ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE MERCHANTABILITY OF THIS SOFTWARE OR ITS FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
If content is very large, an alternative to setting Content or File is to set Size, which will then be checked against the header-reported size but will bypass the decompressing of the actual data.
If math is in another shared library, then that's also the shared library that contains runtime, so something will depend on it and so math's staleness will be checked when processing that library.
If p is transmitted a second time, the type is already known so the output will be just: 07 ff 82 01 2c 01 42 00 A single non-struct value at top level is transmitted like a field with delta tag 0.
If the source start point is higher than the destination start point, or equal height but to the left, then we compose the rows in right-to-left, bottom-up order instead of left-to-right, top-down.
In particular, the list of methods for each embedded interface must be complete (it cannot depend on this interface), and so those methods can be added to the list of all methods of this interface.
Once g is installed, any incoming signals will try to execute, but we won't have the sigaltstack settings and other data set up appropriately until the end of minit, which will unblock the signals.
One common implementation strategy is to unmarshal into a separate value with a layout matching the expected XML using d.DecodeElement,  and then to copy the data from that value into the receiver.
TODO(austin): We could fast path this and basically eliminate contention on c.fractionalMarkWorkersNeeded by precomputing the minimum time at which it's worth next scheduling the fractional worker.
There's not a huge cost to having too many regions: the main processing traces the live area for each variable, which is limited by the number of variables times the area, not the raw region count.
This is separate from the usual GOT entry, just in case the C code assigns to the variable, and of course it only works for single pointers, but we only need to support cgo and that's all it needs.
This means that, by default, command line programs will behave like typical Unix command line programs, while other programs will not crash with SIGPIPE when writing to a closed network connection.
This previous version duplicated code (those lines are in tRunner no matter what), but worse the goroutine teardown implicit in runtime.Goexit was not guaranteed to complete before the test exited.
When this goroutine is done, either because fn(t) returned normally or because a test failure triggered a call to runtime.Goexit, record the duration and send a signal saying that the test is done.
go:cgo_import_static x_cgo_notify_runtime_init_done go:linkname x_cgo_notify_runtime_init_done x_cgo_notify_runtime_init_done go:linkname _cgo_notify_runtime_init_done _cgo_notify_runtime_init_done
loadsys loads the definitions for the low-level runtime and unsafe functions, so that the compiler can generate calls to them, but does not make the names "runtime" or "unsafe" visible as packages.
spec: "If the left operand of a non-constant shift expression is an untyped constant, the type of the constant is what it would be if the shift expression were replaced by its left operand alone.".
Background marking will stop when the work queues are empty and there are no more workers (note that, since this is concurrent, this may be a transient state, but mark termination will clean it up).
C struct fields that cannot be expressed in Go, such as bit fields or misaligned data, are omitted in the Go struct, replaced by appropriate padding to reach the next field or the end of the struct.
Functions may be called concurrently from different goroutines, starting after the call to Transport.RoundTrip and ending either when RoundTrip returns an error, or when the Response.Body is closed.
If you are working in the directory containing the code imported as "unicode" and want to run the tests for "unicode/utf8", you can type "go test ./utf8" instead of needing to specify the full path.
In case a Read results in an error with non-zero bytes read, and the subsequent Write also results in an error, the error from Write is returned, as it is the one that prevented progressing further.
It inserts to the offset of GOT slot for the thread-local symbol from the TOC (the GOT slot is filled by the dynamic linker with the offset of the thread-local symbol from the thread pointer (R13)).
Note that when a signature of a hash of a larger message is needed, the caller is responsible for hashing the larger message and passing the hash (as digest) and the hash function (as opts) to Sign.
Panics caused by user error (that is, everything except run-time panics such as "index out of bounds" errors) do not leave the file that caused them, but are instead turned into plain error returns.
R_ADDRPOWER_PCREL relocates a D-form, DS-form instruction sequence like R_ADDRPOWER_DS but inserts the offset of the GOT slot for the referenced symbol from the TOC rather than the symbol's address.
The array is in order of increasing frequency, and has as its last element a special element with frequency MaxInt32 maxBits     The maximum number of bits that should be used to encode any literal.
The entire test file is presented as the example when it contains a single example function, at least one other function, type, variable, or constant declaration, and no test or benchmark functions.
The fact that it is partial is very important: the input is an AST and a description of some type information to assume about one or more packages, but not all the packages that the program imports.
There is one exception to the rule: a span that consists of a single line, is followed by another paragraph span, begins with a capital letter, and contains no punctuation is formatted as a heading.
These defaults mean that Go-aware build systems can ignore the linking changes and keep running plain 'cmd/link' and get reasonable results, but they can also control the linking details if desired.
When matching against text, the regexp returns a match that begins as early as possible in the input (leftmost), and among those it chooses the one that a backtracking search would have found first.
(A nil interface value is identified by the empty string and transmits no value.) Upon receipt, the decoder verifies that the unpacked concrete item satisfies the interface of the receiving variable.
A more reliable solution is to explicitly annotate tests with required execution order by means of a special "invisible" synchronization primitive (that's what is done for C++ ThreadSanitizer tests).
Because the sql package maintains a free pool of connections and only calls Close when there's a surplus of idle connections, it shouldn't be necessary for drivers to do their own connection caching.
If the Go runtime sees an existing signal handler for the SIGCANCEL or SIGSETXID signals (which are used only on GNU/Linux), it will turn on the SA_ONSTACK flag and otherwise keep the signal handler.
If we have a single rhs expression, it must be a multi- valued expression, in which case handling the first lhs variable will cause all lhs variables to have a type assigned, and we are done as well.
In gc, the only concern is that a nil *rtype must be replaced by a nil Type, but in gccgo this function takes care of ensuring that multiple *rtype for the same type are coalesced into a single Type.
It is called from signal handlers and other limited environments and cannot allocate memory or acquire locks that might be held at the time of the signal, nor can it use substantial amounts of stack.
It is therefore equivalent to fmt.Sprint(args...) except that each argument is indirected (if a pointer), as required, using the same rules as the default string evaluation during template execution.
Its primary job is to wrap existing implementations of such primitives, such as those in package os, into shared public interfaces that abstract the functionality, plus some other related primitives.
The MPEG Software Simulation Group disclaims any and all warranties, whether express, implied, or statuary, including any implied warranties or merchantability or of fitness for a particular purpose.
The main benefits of this system are that cmd/link remains relatively simple (it does not need to implement a complete ELF and Mach-O linker) and that gcc is not needed after the package is compiled.
The reflect.call function does a memmove of the frame structure onto the stack (to set up the inputs), runs the call, and the memmoves the stack back to the frame structure (to preserve the outputs).
This doesn't catch bugs shared between the 1-bit and 4-bit GC program execution, but it does catch mistakes specific to just one of those and bugs in heapBitsSetTypeGCProg's implementation of arrays.
Three common cases: value is exact integer value is exact integer * exact power of ten value is exact integer / exact power of ten These all produce potentially inexact but correctly rounded answers.
Values of the Image interface are created either by calling functions such as NewRGBA and NewPaletted, or by calling Decode on an io.Reader containing image data in a format such as GIF, JPEG or PNG.
When formatting such a fragment, gofmt preserves leading indentation as well as leading and trailing spaces, so that individual sections of a Go program can be formatted by piping them through gofmt.
dominatorsLTOrig runs Lengauer-Tarjan to compute a dominator tree starting at entry and using predFn/succFn to find predecessors/successors to allow computing both dominator and post-dominator trees.
funcbody is normally called after the parser has seen the body of a function but since an interface field declaration does not have a body, we must call it now to pop the current declaration context.
