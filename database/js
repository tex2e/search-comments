The size (dimensions) of the cropped image, specified in the original image's coordinate space.
The stack maintains a current location which may be any element in the stack, not just the top.
The wrapper function should do some stuff, and return a presumably different callback function.
There are also other events, such as `onSubmitEditing` and `onFocus` that can be subscribed to.
There are still more digits in this value, so we must make sure the continuation bit is marked.
This allows computing of touch centroids that have moved after `touchesChangedAfter` timeStamp.
This also allows easier test coverage control by unsetting the global jQuery variable in tests.
This creates a mocha test suite and pipes all supplied info through one of the templates above.
This is implemented by various UI views, but is not declared anywhere as an official interface.
This is maintained as a set of strings for two reasons: (1) It is straightforward to serialize.
This reference is the result of 'getWriteReferenceIfShouldBeConst(variable)', so it's nullable.

We add the code from "lastMapping" to "mapping": First check if there is a new line in between.
We don't know whether the change to the dirstate is at the middle or end of a Mercurial action.
We don't suggest this since it silences all sorts of warnings, but we shouldn't blow up either.
We have no evidence that its status is out of date, so it should remain 'ignored' in the cache.
We have to do this assignment b/c Flow doesn't think "symbol" is something typeof would return.
We will allow the scroll view to give up its lock iff it acquired the lock during an animation.
Windows URIs usually parse all wrong, so we just take matters into our own hands, in this case.

However, if it is big enough, then just slice out the part we want, to save unnecessary copying.
If `display` is specified in the event details, use it as the `hidden` value rather than toggle.
If both are happening, we only set values for the transition and the gesture will catch up later
If clear is set to true, it will set the component to its initial state and re-fetch the images.
If no such Promise is produced, then the Promise returned by this function will resolve to null.
If the grid node has the same sorting as previously, then there is no point in sorting it again.
If this is a block repeat, we want to make sure we only return frag that is bound to this v-for.
If we have reached this point, charA and charB are different, but only one of them is uppercase.
In normal operation, these are only for long filenames or link names, which are rarely very big.
In this way, other module could still overwrite Error.prepareStackTrace to customize stacktrace.
It shows an error when issuing `bower install` and no bower.json is present in current directory
It's possible that the number of rows decreased by more than one increment could compensate for.

Look for for, while and do loops, and inserts *just* at the start of the loop, a check function.
Need to create a resolution response to pass to the bundler to process requires after transform.
No need to remove from the set explicitly since we do that on the marker's onDidDestroy handler.
Normalizes a path, or the path portion of a URL:  - Replaces consequtive slashes with one slash.
Note that if the property changes from one function to another, we don't need to send an update.
Note: The resolution for the resulting mappings is the minimum of this map and the supplied map.
Notice how refs ownership is maintained even when injecting a component into a different parent.
Objects with different constructors are not equivalent, but `Object`s from different frames are.

TODO: We used to use `stream.buffer(stream.filter(...))` for this but it doesn't work in RxJS 5.
The RFC doesn't say what the default encoding is if there is a mediatype so we will return null.
The editor path may get changed (empiracally, prefixed with 'private/'), so we 'getPath()' here.
The idea is to track separately the objects owned by the page and the objects owned by debugger.
The logic below matches latest versions of IE, Firefox, Chrome and Safari on some old platforms.
The previous and the next sibling properties are too set when a child is assigned to its parent.
Then, move the extraLookupPath to the top of the lookup paths list so it will be searched first.

This code was originally written by Brian White (mscdex) for the io.js core querystring library.
This component is used to indicate that the app is loading or there is some activity in the app.
This doesn't happen in normal use but it's useful to be able to truncate the stream for testing.
This function is like `copyObject` except that it accepts a function to customize copied values.
This is a little weird because state changes are triggering commands that trigger state changes.
This is fixed by doing the contains() check on the node's parentNode instead of the node itself.
This is mostly exposed for testing purposes since, unlike `trackActions`, it's side-effect free.
This is only to have a better contract semantic, i.e. another safety net to catch a logic error.
This module contains some utilities for dealing with "container" (pane or pane axis) visibility.
This prevents us having to loop through all of the touches all the time in the most common case.
This primes the cache for the new variables and notifies the caller of changes via the callback.

Trim the selector passed to compile to avoid treating leading and trailing spaces as combinators
We allow an optional additional field, providerName, to indicate the display name of the linter.
We have no evidence that its status is out of date, so it should remain 'modified' in the cache.
We need a cast to `any` here because this test purposefully sends data that Flow does not allow.
We provide our own default comparer because we want to be more strict (by default) than RxJS is.
We'll just report that the repository state changed, which should trigger a full client refresh.
When true, the scroll view will not catch taps, and the keyboard will not dismiss automatically.
When we have an estimated pixels/delta value, we just handle horizontal scrolling entirely here.
When writing this code also evaluating per node was missing out connecting tokens in some cases.

reset end anchor position in case the position was messed up by an external drag-n-drop library.
sort results by number of results found, then by number of hits then by number of matching lines
stopWatching() should be a noop here but we call it just in case we missed a blur event somehow.
the polygon does not (cumulatively) wind around it, but has a negative (counter-clockwise) area.
then `buffering` is true, then `write()` calls are buffered in memory until `flush()` is invoked
this function registers json5 extension, so you can do `require("./config.json5")` kind of thing
this is only acceptable if we're on the very last empty segment of a file with a trailing slash.
- The shorter the result, the closer the length is to what you searched for, so it's more likely.

An instance of the SourceMapGenerator represents a source map which is being built incrementally.
Associate the code between "lastGeneratedColumn" and "mapping.generatedColumn" with "lastMapping"
Both clientHeight and scrollHeight are rounded to integer values, so we tolerate one pixel error.

Given a mode spec (anything that resolveMode accepts), find and initialize an actual mode object.
IE's event fires out of order with respect to key and input events on deletion, so we discard it.
If a .babelrc file doesn't exist in the project, use the Babel config provided with react-native.
If it fails to read, invalidate the in memory cache for the source and delete the entry directory
If not recursing update to navigator at all, may as well avoid computation of navigator children.
If returning `false`, results from the provider will only be shown in the OmniSearch result list.
If set to false, the picker will be disabled, i.e. the user will not be able to make a selection.
If so, collapses the top of impliedEvalAncestorsStack and reports on the original CallExpression.
If the parent node is an export declaration, it will be responsible for printing node.decorators.
If there were no args and we have unknown options, then they are extraneous and we need to error.
If there's no such element (i.e. all elements are smaller than the specimen) returns right bound.
If they do, those comment tags must be intended to appear *after* that child, so move them there.
If we hit EOF and our comment is still unclosed, trigger an error and end the comment implicitly.
If you need to convert an array-like object, like `arguments`, into an array use toArray instead.
Improve performance by isolating this hot code path from the try/catch block in `updateChildren`.
Indicates that we are in the middle of a activate/onDidStopChangingActivePaneItem pair of events.
Method is assumed to be a standard D3 getter-setter: If passed with no arguments, gets the value.
Need to write something to prevent tmp to automatically remove the temp dir (it removes if empty)
Note that owner is not calculated for text nodes because they are not created from real elements.
Note: The resolution for the resulting mappings is the minimium of this map and the supplied map.
Now kill the node and render it on top of server-rendered markup, as if we used server rendering.
Object patterns are sorted and then the first identifier in each of patterns is used for sorting.

Similar to eachField, except that iteration stops as soon as the callback returns a truthy value.
Simulates a top level event being dispatched from a raw event that occurred on an `Element` node.
Since Espree does not return whitespace nodes, fetch the source code and do matching via regexps.
Some git servers do not support shallow clones When that happens, we mark this host and try again

Test setup: Mock out the dependency on HgRepository::_updateStatuses, and set up the cache state.
Tests that debugger works correctly if pause event occurs when DevTools frontend is being loaded.
That way we can skip a lot of extra work when resolving symlinks for bundled dependencies in npm.
The event must have a "type" attribute which corresponds to a type registered in the constructor.
The first caller of `popInitialNotification` will get the initial notification object, or `null`.
The key will persist until the initial stack and its derived stack no longer contains this route.
The only parameter is a raw source map (either as a JSON string, or already parsed to an object).
The tree is used both to go from line numbers to line objects, and to go from objects to numbers.
The value should be between minimumValue and maximumValue, which default to 0 and 1 respectively.
These items are ordered based on the specified priority with which they are added to this object.
This can happen without the full execution of the command to fail, but we want to learn about it.
This enables Relay to synthesize a complete query to fetch the data necessary to render your app.
This enables us to create wrapped "child constructors" for prototypal inheritance and cache them.
This generates events of comments before/after events which are generated the original generator.
This gets deleted in finishOperationAndMoveEditor(), which is called both on success and failure.
This happens if the stream completes since we opened a new buffer when the previous record ended.
This is used in order to check whether or not `this` binding is a reference to the global object.
This is used to conserve memory by avoiding array allocations, and thus sacrifices API cleanness.
This means we expect the on*Change handlers to be in charge of updating our `selectedValue` prop.
This needs to be the canonical type definition so that we can use these in the service framework.
This should never happen because the server must be started with stderr redirected to a log file.
Though this field can have subselections, there is no way we can infer this from `address: null`.
Throughout this file we use Object.defineProperty to prevent redefinition of exported properties.
To add a View as an Atom workspace pane, we return `DiffViewElement` which extends `HTMLElement`.

Used by replaceSelections to allow moving the selection to the start or around the replaced test.
Used to ensure that the line number gutter is still the right size for the current document size.
Warn if there's no key explicitly set on dynamic arrays of children or object keys are not valid.
Warnings help guard against subtle yet significant issues that can impact the quality of the app.
We allow actual time window to be arbitrarily small but don't want the UI window to be too small.
We expect the string to end with a ')', so the last entry in copiedFiles will be an empty string.
We only need an additional one if there was an update, otherwise we just ended with a scopeBreak.
We return an event with a bunch of fields including: url, title, loading, canGoBack, canGoForward
When `locations` is on, you can pass this to record the source file in every node's `loc` object.

Work around bug in node v0.10.0 where the CryptoStream gets stuck and never starts reading again.
`LinkingIOS` gives you a general interface to interact with both incoming and outgoing app links.
`Session` is particular about what order everything is closed in, so we manage it carefully here.

Further, it does not need to be updated since no additional data can be read about a deleted node.
Generate warnings for stuff that used to be allowed core module names like http, events, util, etc
Given a DOM node, return the closest ReactDOMComponent or ReactDOMTextComponent instance ancestor.
Given a payload of data and a path of fields, extracts the `id` of the node specified by the path.
If any result were not transferred from child contexts, this sets the head segments to both cases.
If anyone ever complains about this, then I guess the strategy could be made configurable somehow.
If restoring state, then the project already exists with local directory and wrong repo instances.
If the state of the CircularBuffer changes while it is being iterated, it will throw an exception.
If the task throws an exception (presumably) Node.js restores the domain stack for the next event.
If there are profiles, pre-fill the form with the information from the specified selected profile.
If there is not the `test` part, the `body` path comes from the `init` part and the `update` part.
It loops over all of the valid configuration filenames in order to find the first one that exists.
Jasmine 1.3 does not support `jasmine.objectContaining`, so we need to check the results manually:
List all packages when in interactive mode + json enabled, and always when in non-interactive mode
Make sure that once we render once, we stay rendered even if incrementalGroupEnabled gets flipped.
Make the new number and constrain it to a precision of 6, this matches numbers the engine returns.
Map from property "standard name" to an object with info about how to set the property in the DOM.
Neither will actually show up until you render the component (simply instantiating is not enough).
New selection, which happens on user interaction via select and collapse, resets the tracked node.
Note that in edge cases, some architecture components instance's in-memory cache might be skipped.
On Windows the 'comspec' environment variable is used, so cmd.exe does not need to be on the path.
One of `WhileStatement`, `DoWhileStatement`, `ForStatement`, `ForInStatement`, and `ForStatement`.
Only write to the front of map if existing edge with id is deleted or have an older deletion time.
Receives a state machine signal, performs side effects of the transition and stores the new state.
Returns a reference to the underlying scroll responder, which supports operations like `scrollTo`.
See the License for the specific language governing permissions and limitations under the License.
Set up the cache as if these two other files were already inserted: '/A/blah.js' and '/Z/blah.js'.
Some existing components rely on inst.props even after they've been destroyed (in event handlers).
Suppress optimizelegibility in Webkit, since it breaks text measuring on line wrapping boundaries.
The first segment in the list should be cursors beginning at the top of the range (i.e. first(N)).
The name for the field when serializing the query or interpreting query responses from the server.
The writeFile endpoint accepts the following query parameters:  path: path to the file to written.
There was an initial heartbeat, but we can't be sure if it went before or after we do listen here.
These types are unprintable because they serve as abstract supertypes for other (printable) types.
This considers a property set to undefined to be equivalent to a property that was not set at all.
This controls how often the scroll event will be fired while scrolling (as a time interval in ms).
This function is used because child instances need access to assets defined in its ancestor chain.
This isn't quite as efficient as Q's implementation of denodeify, but it's considerably less code.
This means that the information is first class (it can be passed around), but cannot be inspected.
This node might be from another React instance, so we make sure not to examine the node cache here
This will throw later in _renderValidatedComponent, but add an early warning now to help debugging
Tracks the maximum line length so that the horizontal scrollbar can be kept static when scrolling.
Tracks when resetInput has punted to just putting a short string instead of the (large) selection.
Traversing the AST is an error-prone process and it's hard to be sure we've handled all the cases.
Trying to get currentState when mounting App component will likely to have the initial value here.
Uses props from `this.props` and state from `this.state` to render the structure of the component.
Using the `...` operator causes null/undefined errors, and `Object.assign` bypasses type checking.
WARNING: These callbacks will fire even if a keyboard is displayed in a different navigation pane.
We release all dispatched `SyntheticEvent`s after each event loop, adding them back into the pool.
When data is initially created, via ("key", "val") signature, keys will be converted to camelCase.
When enabled, import/export statements are not constrained to appearing at the top of the program.
When moving two touches in opposite directions, the cumulative distance is zero in each dimension.
While we plan to keep most of the API, the actual format of measurements will change dramatically.
`push` returns new array length, so the first asset will get id 1 (not 0) to make the value truthy
details is an object containing:  - `alertBody` : The message displayed in the notification alert.
exported async module functions //// nextTick implementation with browser-compatible fallback ////
if flushing, and not using null-padding, then need to emit the last chunk(s) sitting in the queue.
important: we want to resolve root + dir to ensure the requested path doesn't traverse beyond root
in production we take use the initially loaded manifest since this should not change in production

numeric x and y parameters for Expr.filter.CHILD remember that false/true cast respectively to 0/1
our loop keyword was actually either in a string or a property, so let's exit and ignore this line
pass env + BOWER_PID so callees can identify a preinstall+postinstall from the same bower instance
should disallow a comment on the next line that's not in turn followed by a blank in "always" mode
stdout should hopefully be set to line-buffering, in which case the string would come on one line.
this is used as the "main" field in package.json and used by bundlers like Webpack and Browserify.
timestampSkewSec:      optional number of seconds of permitted clock skew for incoming timestamps.
'nobody' typically doesn't have permission to write to /tmp even if it's never used, sh freaks out.

Create uses `verbatim` and `n` answer buffer and that implies that untracked files will be ignored.
E.g. resume (V8 request 'continue') does no work correctly when args are empty instead of undefined
Exposing "did clean" flag purely so specs can infer whether things have been cleaned up as intended
FIXME: bring back Animation events as we figure out a way to show them while not cluttering the UI.
First, clone the lookup paths so we're not messing things up for subsequent calls to this function.
First, search the line map for the text node corresponding to, or closest to, the target character.
For IE9 compat: when both class and :class are present getAttribute('class') returns wrong value...
For property(object), the object specifies the names and values of the properties to set or remove.
For radio buttons, being checked means that the radio button's value corresponds to the model value
For summing up the modifiers along the contour, we use respective variables si+, si-, so-, and so+.
For translate-y, usually the view doesn't wish to "remain" responder after one of many touches end.
Format selections should start at the begining of the line, and include the last selected line end.
Here we depart from the documented algorithm, in order to avoid building up an actual levels array.
However, those costs aren't great enough to justify a new abstraction for managing it at this time.
However, to have a reasonable HashMap performance i.e. O(1) for insertion, deletion, and retrieval.
If any cells are in progress, then other updates are skipped because they will just be wasted work.
If new classes are needed, you should re-execute `createHierarchyRenderer` with the same arguments.
If nothing matches, device scale is larger than any available scales, so we return the biggest one.
If pos.column does not exceed the indentation amount, then there must be only whitespace before it.
If the array is large and already in sort order, pass `true` for **isSorted** to use binary search.
If the stream is completed timeout will not return its default value and we will see an EmptyError.
If they are expensive to re-render, wrap them in StaticContainer or other mechanism as appropriate.
If true, a note stating the `default` for this option, if any, will be appended to the help output.
Implement an async ._write(chunk, cb), and it'll handle all the drain event emission and buffering.
Initially when data with children is returned to the Chrome debugger only the ObjectId is returned.

Once we have Camera roll, Toast, Intent (for opening URLs) we should make this consistent with iOS.
Pushing new elements is done relative to the current location not relative to the top of the stack.
Remove the first index, because this is the default connection profile, not a user-created profile.

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket See https://github.com/websockets/ws
Similar to `getConfig`, this is used to create the query corresponding to the `optimisticResponse`.
So here, we restore top of the stack to the previous location before pushing a new nav stack entry.
Some browse builtin objects can report typeof 'function' (e.g. NodeList in old versions of Safari).

TODO(mbolin): Ideally, this Disposable should be garbage-collected if this ContextMenu is disposed.
TODO: Consider a more efficient strategy that does not blindly destroy all of the existing markers.
Target is a commit, so it's a stale target (not a moving target) There's nothing to do in this case
The TypeRegistry is a centralized place to register functions that serialize and deserialize types.
The alternative was to add a *lot* of extra cruft to that file, making it less readable and slower.
The left/right label data are the same, so a before/after label can be replaced by an on-bar label.
The only parameter is the raw source map (either as a JSON string, or already parsed to an object).
The parent directory or something it symlinks to must eventually be in a folder that npm maintains.
The server is asking for replies to the given prompts for keyboard-interactive user authentication.
The subtasks will be run in order so we can take advantage of that and only run build-modules once.
The use preview tabs setting was removed from 'tabs' package in atom 1.6 and moved to core instead.
There is also an `extra` field where additional details about certain kinds of errors are provided.
These are the JSHint options that can take any value (we use this object to detect invalid options)
These fields are similar to connections, but do not support range calls such as `first` or `after`.
This allows for types defined in one service to include types from another service in another file.
This allows to use the fake timing by default and is a direct port from Atom's `spec-helper.coffee`

This includes any client changes (new feature or whatever) that do not work with the older servers.
This is a way to detect if Component is a stateless arrow function component, which is not newable.
This is necessary because assert.deepEqual() gets confused when properties are in different orders.
This is not to be confused with a return value of `null`, which may result from the lack of a node.
This is preserved between calls to `flush` so that it can be resumed if a task throws an exception.
This method is designed to be overridden by subclasses that need to handle missing properties, etc.

Use the capture phase since resize handles stop propagation of the event during the bubbling phase.
We can later filter the errors when they are found to be not an issue in nodes we don't care about.
We do not require precise (breakpoint) location but limit the number of lines to search or mapping.
We don't sort by project relative path as that will interleave diagnostics from different projects.

if we've ended and we have some data left, then emit 'readable' now to make sure it gets picked up.
in a node_modules folder, resolve symbolic links to bundled dependencies when creating the package.
make sure that the _header and such is emitted, and clear out the _currentEntry link on the parent.
since the value of the parameters are  unknown during parsing time we set the value to `undefined`.
whenever we return null, then we set a flag to say that we're awaiting a 'readable' event emission.
"A request-path path-matches a given cookie-path if at least one of the following conditions holds:"
"On-Demand-Dispatched Events":  - On-demand-dispatched events are not returned from `extractEvents`.
(This isn't necessary if the gadget's default location is at the top, but is if it was moved there.)
(Truth: Nothing even uses the indices in this case, but let's make this describe the truth anyways).

Optionally, precede with a call to `applyOptimistic()` to apply an update optimistically to the store.
Override this to do fancier things, like read the "files" array from a package.json file or something.
Passing false causes the minimum necessary scroll to occur, so the selection sticks to the top/bottom.
Pausing it causes it to stop emitting entry events, and also pauses the current entry if there is one.

In addition, the Store will immediately invoke the callback with data currently in the Store, iff there is any.
Instead, it's more useful to identify the group of gadgets to which this one belongs and get it out of the way.
Interacts with the background and text classes because the mode may output tokens that influence these classes.
It is duplicated here to handle tarballs that are created using other means, such as system tar or git archive.
Locate the root containing the tracked node efficiently by using the child-derived containsTrackedNode property
Mix two arrays such that each element of the second array is concatenated onto each element of the first array.

Some apps may see an improvement in perf, but sometimes perf and memory usage can actually get worse with this.
Start a new scope with regard to labels and the `inFunction` flag (restore them to their old value afterwards).
The `onResponderReject` won't fire in that case - it only fires when a *current* responder rejects our request.
The callback is auto-bound to the instance, and this avoids component modules having to rely on the global Vue.
The number of photos wanted in reverse order of the photo application (i.e. most recent first for SavedPhotos).
The only argument is an object with the following properties:  - line: The line number in the generated source.
The only case we haven't checked yet is keys that are in two but aren't in one, which means they are different.
The supplied `callback` will be invoked whenever data returned by the last invocation to `resolve` has changed.
Then, depending on that, we'll figure out whether it's a single-file module, gzipped tarball, or naked tarball.
These are JSHint boolean options which are shared with JSLint where the definition in JSHint is opposite JSLint
This can occur on a reconnect, where the old socket has been closed but its close event is sent asynchronously.
This convenience function would create such OrderedMap instance from a plain JS Array of FileTreeNode instances

This test is executed only once but we still do memoizing since we can use the boxSizingReliable pre-computing.
This will usually be snapped to a 4 milisecond delay, but once we're flushing, there's no delay between events.
To signal this, we wrap them into an opaque-ish object to discourage reaching into it until the API stabilizes.
Trying to access random objects can cause a crash due to insonsistent state of internal properties of wrappers.
Unfortunately, it never clears the dummy parent nodes from the document fragment, so it leaks memory over time.
Unfortunately, this solution changes the semantics of console.log() to be asynchronous rather than synchronous.
Usually a node ends exactly at a token, but due to ASI, sometimes a node's range extends beyond its last token.
Validates that a type does not directly contain any types which are known to directly or indirectly contain it.
We add .fud to Pratt's model, which is like .nud except that it is only used on the first token of a statement.
We cannot use value of natively driven nodes this way as the value we have access from JS may not be up to date
We need to make sure we don't end up in a deadlock where the first reconnection attempt blocks subsequent ones.
We want to invalidate aggressively because an incorrect fix application is far worse than a failed application.
`path.normalize` and `path.join` are used to turn forward slashes in the file path into backslashes on Windows.
center - The image will be scaled down such that it is completely visible, if bigger than the area of the view.
if the tab has already been shown once, always continue to show it so we preserve state between tab transitions
if the vm is being manipulated by a parent directive during the parent's compilation phase, skip the animation.
if we're here then some package(s) doesn't have all its deps satisified so lets just jam those names on the end
in IE11 the "compositionend" event fires AFTER the "input" event, so the input handler is blocked at the end...
instruments always fail with 255 because it expects more arguments, but we want it to only launch the simulator
means that the current buffer couldn't be completely output update this._offset to reflect how much WAS written
verify that y.toArray() returns an array and if we create a new Yallist from that array, we get a list matching
you can put blocks of nulls between entries anywhere, so appending one tarball to another is technically valid.
- Previous 'file' scope messages are invalidated if and only if filePathToMessages contains their key as a path.
150ms is empirically long enough to let the stack clear from this blur event and for the click event to trigger.

Add on and off methods to a constructor's prototype, to make registering events on such objects more convenient.
An optional collision key allows a mutation to identify itself with other mutations that affect the same fields.
Attaches a WebSocket based connection to the Packager to expose Hot Module Replacement updates to the simulator.
Continue from loader breakpoint to hit xdebug_break() which will load whole www repo for evaluation if possible.
Due to a bug in the Gutter API, destroying a Gutter after the editor has been destroyed results in an exception.
Ensure no lingering debounced renders are waiting and will muck with the state of the package between test runs.
Ensure that, if the cursor was in the whitespace at the start of the line, it is moved to the end of that space.
Esprima includes the leading colon (and possibly spaces) as part of the typehint, so we have to strip those out.

Here we poll to unregister it when the editor is no longer in the document, so that it can be garbage-collected.
However, `1.2.4-alpha.notready` should NOT be allowed, even though it's within the range set by the comparators.
I would expect the service framework to send onCompleted when it disconnects, but that seemingly doesn't happen.
IE9 claims to support the input event but fails to trigger it when deleting text, so we ignore its input events.
If `rootNode.form` was non-null, then we could try `form.elements`, but that sometimes behaves strangely in IE8.
If a state update triggers rerendering that in turn fires an onDOMReady, that second onDOMReady should not fail.
If it's a spacebar character, assume that we have already handled it at the keypress level and bail immediately.
If not, then assume it's something that'll be compiled, or some other sort of script, and just call it directly.
If the year-value is greater than or equal to 70 and less than or equal to 99, increment the year-value by 1900.
If this is the third time the process has errored (i.e. the have already been two errors before), stop retrying.
It is safe to call `removeImageForTag()` without first calling `hasImageForTag()`, it will simply fail silently.
Iterate over each mapping between an original source/line/column and a generated line/column in this source map.
Last two args are only used by updateDoc, since they have to be expressed in the line numbers before the update.
Linker functions return an unlink function that tearsdown all directives instances generated during the process.
Make sure the gutters options contains the element "CodeMirror-linenumbers" when the lineNumbers option is true.
Many browsers/platforms do not support this, however (see http://webkit.org/b/16699 and http://crbug.com/12361).
Mark as created if the store did not have a record but disk cache did (either a known record or known deletion).
Multiply to translation matrix on the right rather than translate (which would implicitly multiply on the left).
NOTE: `arguments` has a very significant performance penalty, which is why we don't support unlimited arguments.
Note that this expects indentation to already have been taken into account when breaking, just not resolved yet.
Nuclide URIs disallow use of the `hash` attribute, and any hash characters are interpreted as as literal hashes.
Observable dispose function, which is called on subscription dipsose, on stream completion, and on stream error.

Provides a `CallbackQueue` queue for collecting `onDOMReady` callbacks during the performing of the transaction.
Returns the first child in a collection of children and verifies that there is only one child in the collection.
Reversing the new modules makes sense because we get them through the resolver which returns a BFS ordered list.
Sass 3.3 leaves out the 'names' array, so we deviate from the spec (which requires the array) to play nice here.
Split the parameters into two groups -- all of the trailing optional paramaters, and the rest of the parameters.
Synthetic events are dispatched by event plugins, typically in response to a top-level event delegation handler.
THE CONFIGURATION Is the object passed to the constructor and conceptually shared among all instances in a tree.
The Parser API calls this ArrowExpression, but Esprima and all other actual parsers use ArrowFunctionExpression.
The best way to interact with the Store (if you are a React Component) is to use the decorator in `decorate.js`.
The emptyLines object needs to be created all the way down here so that Lines.prototype will be fully populated.
The first level of defense is to watch for the creation and deletion of the wlock and ignore events accordingly.
The input field is not shown, but is a way for us to bring focus back to a place where we can detect keypresses.
The leaving-paths are paths from `return` statements and `throw` statements in a `try` block or a `catch` block.
The new registry is intended to be analyzed to determine whether its rules should be disabled or set to warning.
The only possible recovery here is reconnecting a new client, but the failed to serialize events will be missed.
The primary difference between this and `createForFields` is whether or not the connection edges are re-fetched.
The reason being is that we simply want to support ES3 environments which doesn't implement computed properties.
Thin wrapper to reprint requires, it's wrapped in a new function in order to easily attach comments to the node.
This allows that identifier to appear as the first word in a comment even if it begins with a lower-case letter.
This call would trigger complete reconstruction of the tree, to reflect the possibly changed derived properties.
This callback will be called once ViewPager finish navigating to selected page (when user swipes between pages).
This can be used to set an existing socket, bypassing normal UI flow to improve iteration speed for development.
This optimistic response is used to pre-emptively update the client cache to simulate an instantaneous response.
This skips testing argument types because type metadata for scalar arguments may be omitted by the Babel plugin.
This will not invoke `shouldComponentUpdate`, but it will invoke `componentWillUpdate` and `componentDidUpdate`.
To have the roots colored consistently we manually add all parents of all of the modified nodes up till the root
Used to invalidate the layout so the parent knows it needs to compensate for the height in the placeholder size.
Uses the .containsSelection child-derived property to efficiently build the list of the currently selected nodes
Verifies that the internal representation of a set of `renderedChildren` accurately reflects what is in the DOM.
We do not want to emit a warning for this, though, as this will already be reported as resource loading failure.
When `snapToInterval` is set, `snapToAlignment` will define the relationship of the snapping to the scroll view.
When strict match is enabled give priority to non-pre-releases We do this by filtering every pre-release version
`AppStateIOS` can tell you if the app is in the foreground or background, and notify you when the state changes.
`View`, `Text`, and `Image` are already provided, and you can create custom ones with `createAnimatedComponent`.
`this._previousEvaluationSubscriptions` can change at any time and are a distinct subset of `this._disposables`.
context: if this is a transcluded component, context will be the common parent vm of this instance and its host.
if every destination was unpiped, either before entering this function, or in the while loop, then stop flowing.
note that raising N higher will mean that the overhead increases, because we're creating more and more watchers.
this._lastSuggestionAtMouse will only be set if hyperclick returned a promise that resolved to a non-null value.
when children is empty, logs won't be passed in at all (asyncMap is weird) so shortcircuit before arg validation
with a single exception that CoverInitializedName when used directly in an Expression, generates an early error.
"Hidden" options and subcmds are ones with the `hidden: true` attribute to exclude them from default help output.

FIXME Should probably have an option in net.Socket to create a stream from an existing fd which is writable only.
FIXME: support debugData.stack_update_needs_step_in flag by calling WebInspector.debugger_model.callStackModified
Failing that, see if there is a cursor-motion command (starting with 'go') bound to the keyname without 'Shift-'.
Forces the potentially scrollable region to redraw so its scrollbars are drawn with styles from the active theme.
Gets the blame for the filePath at the current revision, including uncommitted changes (but not unsaved changes).
Given a mode and a state (for that mode), find the inner mode and state at the position that the state refers to.
Given a prepared measurement object, measures the position of an actual character (or fetches it from the cache).
IE10+ fire input events to often, such when a placeholder changes or when an input with a placeholder is focused.
Ideally this would be a union of Field/Fragment/Mutation/Query/Subscription, but that causes lots of Flow errors.
If error is EXDEV it means that we are trying to rename across different drives, so we copy and remove it instead
If static-only, then we don't need to pass the type hint params since we're not going to do any dynamic checking.
If the dropdown was changed so that selection is no longer the same, notify the value or selectedOptions binding.
If the evaluation of a ko.computed causes side effects, it's possible that it will trigger its own re-evaluation.
If you want esprima to generate .range information (recast only uses .loc internally), pass true for this option.
In Polish language abbraviated months are not commonly used so there is a dispute about the proper abbraviations.
Includes the `nodePath` (ancestor nodes) that can be used to construct an appropriate the JSONPath for the query.
Initially, we assume that none of the subscriptions are still being used (i.e., all are candidates for disposal).
It will receive the route object in the `route` prop, a navigator, and all of the props specified in `passProps`.
Iterate until either we run out of mappings, or we run into a mapping for a different line than the one we found.
No need to pop anything from newPath.stack or oldPath.stack, since newPath and oldPath are fresh local variables.
Now the magic: trying to recover the key comment when it's gotten conjoined to the key or otherwise shenanigan'd.
OOP --------------- If Underscore is called as a function, it returns a wrapped object that can be used OO-style.
Otherwise, `querySet` and `fragmentPointers` will be empty, and `nextVariables` will be equal to `lastVariables`.
Parent property, however, can't be one of the node's immutable fields, otherwise it'd create circular references.
Positive IDs represent objects which live on the server, negative IDs represent objects which live on the client.
Print a console warning and replace the code with a function that will immediately throw an error in the browser.
Prioritizes checking of indices that are most likely to change so that the comparison bails as early as possible.

Simple wrappers around NativeANimatedModule to provide flow and autocmplete support for the native module methods
Special demo text that makes itself untouchable so that it doesn't destroy the experiment and confuse the output.
TODO: Should be `arrayOf(TestRunner)`, but that would require a real object since this is runtime code for React.
The DOM updates done when an operation finishes are batched so that the minimum number of relayouts are required.
The default value is zero, which results in the scroll event being sent only once each time the view is scrolled.
The leftToken should be the last closing parenthesis, and the operatorToken should be the token right after that.
The length of the stack can be either even or odd, depending on whether or not we have a name for the root value.
The most recent save request should trigger another change event, so we'll check for conflicts when that happens.
The sole purpose of wrapping the task is to catch the exception and recycle the task object after its single use.
The spans will have null for their from/to properties when the marker continues beyond the start/end of the line.
These are the ways in which an identifier might be declared, note that these identifiers are safe to use in code.
This "in your face" style of warning allows developers to notice and correct these issues as quickly as possible.
This JS code is a simple facade that provides a clear JS API, real Error objects, and simple non-multi functions.
This function helps you with (2) by freezing the object and throwing if the user subsequently modifies the value.
This gives another reason to use the configuration object sparingly - it is expensive to rebuild the entire tree.
This method is invoked before `getInitialState` and therefore cannot rely on `this.state` or use `this.setState`.
Throw out the first chunk (anything before the first '--- ' sequence), because it is not part of a complete diff.
Tracks when resetInput has punted to just putting a short string into the textarea instead of the full selection.
Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least 30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels.
Unfortunately, this wouldn't be noticed until `dispose()` was called on the result when an error would be thrown.
Used to start the HHVM instance that the dummy connection connects to so we can evaluate expressions in the REPL.
Verifies that the rendered `StatusDisplay` instances match the `props` that were responsible for allocating them.
We only show text nodes inline in elements if the element only has a single child, and that child is a text node.
When the message is an array with multiple elements, the second element onwards comprise the trace for the error.
`TestRunnerPanel` expects an Array so it can render the test runners in a dropdown and maintain a selected index.
`callback` will be invoked with a `permissions` object:  - `alert` :boolean - `badge` :boolean - `sound` :boolean
`parentID` ID of the parent record containing the connection which may have metadata that needs to be re-fetched.
at this point, no one needed a drain, so we just ran out of data on the next readable event, start it over again.
either specified a script locally, in which case, done, or a package, in which case, complete against its scripts
gorilla When removing multiple, defaultValue is applied again, being omitted means that "monkey" will be selected
it'd be nice to asyncMap these, but actually, doing them in parallel generally munges up the output from node-waf
prefer to return the chmod error, if one occurs, but still try to close, and report closing errors if they occur.
the sole purpose of `deferCleanup` is so that we can "deactivate" the vm right now and perform DOM removal later.
"If delta-seconds is less than or equal to zero (0), let expiry-time be the earliest representable date and time."
- When returned from `extractEvents`, deferred-dispatched events contain an "accumulation" of deferred dispatches.
@fileoverview A rule to suggest using of const declaration for variables that are never reassigned after declared.
A floating-point number that determines how quickly the scroll view decelerates after the user lifts their finger.
All comparisons are done based on these tokens directly, so they are always valid regardless of an undefined item.
Calling checkAllFields is too strict when deep is false, because then we only care about this.isSupertypeOf(vDef).
Check if the list of variable declarations is mixed, i.e. whether it contains both require and other declarations.
Compile and execute a filtering function Provide `match` to avoid retokenization if we modified the selector above
Cursor position was documented in a test and is retained here after changes to how text is set in the text editor.
Distributed under an MIT license: http://codemirror.net/LICENSE Utility function that allows modes to be combined.
Do not display a warning if 'default' is the first statement or if there is a special /* falls through */ comment.
Escape the (unlikely) pathalogical case where an observable's current value is itself (or similar reference cycle)
For example, lastAccessed may not be important to some stores and an equality comparison could exclude that field.
If both paths of the `try` block and the `catch` block are unreachable, the next path becomes unreachable as well.
If nothing is responder, then the negotiation should propagate directly to the deepest target in the second touch.
If the selection is a single file or a single collapsed directory, the selection is set to the directory's parent.
If the term starts or ends with non word characters, then the match will not require word boundaries on that side.
If we're in the browser, add `_` as a global object via a string identifier, for Closure Compiler "advanced" mode.
In addition, supplying a `renderLoading` that returns undefined has the same effect as not supplying the callback.
Insert a sentinel executor that will not be called until all of the other promises in the queue have been flushed.
Instead, we're going to have to use the following general formula, that works in a rather Javascript friendly way.
Internal queue of events that have accumulated their dispatches and are waiting to have their dispatches executed.
Keep both the (mapped) and old keys if they differ, just as traverseAllChildren used to do for objects as children
Let's the build system minify keys without losing the ability to dynamically use key strings as values themselves.
Maintain the back-end logic of old timeline, skip console.time() / console.timeEnd() that are not properly nested.
Maximum number of results to render in the table before truncating and displaying a "Max results reached" message.
MutationObservers are desirable because they have high priority and work reliably everywhere they are implemented.
New caches will be created and the unlock returned, allowing direct access to the newly created empty data object.
Note that closeEditor may remove entries if the editor being closed does not have a path (aka has not been saved).
Note that if the record is known to be deleted in the store then it will have been been marked as created already.
Note, however, that they are *not* available on composite components that aren't directly backed by a native view.
Note: If someone maintains a reference to the structure within options they could mutate the ModuleMap's behavior.
Now that the user has selected a build system, we no longer care about what the selected one was the last session.
On Mac OSX El Capitan, bash seems to wipe out the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variables.
Only create a range if `edges` field is present Overwrite an existing range only if the new force index is greater

Returns whether the number should be ignored when used as an array index with enabled 'ignoreArrayIndexes' option.
Router has been initialized, but due to the chrome bug it will not yet actually route HTML5 history state changes.
Since cursors are added at the end of nodes this will keep the most valid cursor that appears deepest in the tree.
Since plain JS classes are defined without any special initialization logic, we can not catch common errors early.
So the easiest way to deal with this is to pass off the responsibility to "cmd /c", which has that logic built in.
Supply the `renderWindowBoundaryIndicator` prop to indicate the boundary to the user, e.g. with a row placeholder.
The ConnectionMultiplexer makes multiple debugger connections appear to be a single connection to the debugger UI.
The absence of this method indicates to clients that they should not expose UI that depends on this functionality.
The event is propagating back up through the currentTarget's ancestors in reverse order, starting with the parent.
The motivation behind this approach is to provide a total order on menu item ordering rather than a partial order.
The typechecks transform has a static-only mode that doesn't actually perform a transform but validates the types.
There is no guarantee that calls to `setState` will run synchronously, as they may eventually be batched together.
This API should be called `delete` but we'd have to make sure to always transform these to strings for IE support.
This call is not really meant to be called directly, as callers have to manipulate the internal buffer afterwards.
This code is taken from deepmerge repo (https://github.com/KyleAMathews/deepmerge) and modified to meet our needs.
This is the type that will be the root of our mutations, and the entry point into performing writes in our schema.
This means we can check all the application code without having to worry about issues caused in the parser tokens.

Update metrics unless they are being edited (if a CSS property is added, a StyleSheetChanged event is dispatched).
Verify that the remote could be parsed and that a protocol is set This case is unlikely, but let's still cover it.
Version 1.1: new BigInteger("0", 10) returns "proper" zero Version 1.2: square() API, isProbablePrime fix (public)
We need to ensure the fragment is properly populated first, breaking out of our lazy approach for just this level.
We should never have UNCACHED status, since we remove frames with UNCACHED application cache status from the tree.
When _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.
When a text editor that we were observing is destroyed, we need to do clean-up even if its grammar hasn't changed.
When executing asynchronously, it's easier to just have this method be the one that calls for removal of the view.
While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.
Won't happen, except if the developer has manually removed some DOM elements (then we're in an undefined scenario)
Work around problem with bounding client rects on ranges being returned incorrectly when zoomed on IE10 and below.
`diffModel` is acting as the action creator for commit view and needs to be passed so methods can be called on it.

@param options.rootPath Absolute path to the directory that contains the .buckconfig file to configure the project.
Always append ourselves to the end of the arguments, to make sure we match the number of arguments the user expects
An optimization is to attach the new elements and THEN detach the old ones instead of detaching and THEN attaching.
Associate the remaining code in the current line with "lastMapping" and add the remaining lines without any mapping
Because RuleTester uses it() and describe() from Mocha, any failures would show up in the output of this test file.
By default, it will extrapolate the curve beyond the ranges given, but you can also have it clamp the output value.
Checks whether or not a given variable is a function declaration or a class declaration in an upper function scope.
Checks whether the given ID was created on the client, as opposed to an ID that's understood by the server as well.
Compare props and variables and reset the internal query variables if outside query variables change the component.
Consume a semicolon, or, failing that, see if we are allowed to pretend that there is a semicolon at this position.
Convenience version of a common use case of `filter`: selecting only objects containing specific `key:value` pairs.

Do not pass these events downstream to ScrollView since they will be registered in ListView's own ScrollResponder.Mixin
Element contains another Purposefully does not implement inclusive descendent As in, an element does not contain itself
Even though this is just a placeholder for a gadget, there's a chance it'll need to be serialized before we replace it.
Finds all instance of components in the rendered tree that are DOM components with the class name matching `className`.
For big changes, we hide the enclosing element during the update, since that speeds up the operations on most browsers.
Given a function that returns bindings, create and return a new object that contains binding value-accessors functions.
Here we need to decide whether the reprinted code for newNode is appropriate for patching into the location of oldNode.
If `value` is not supplied (or null/undefined), user actions that affect the value will trigger updates to the element.
If any edges were missing data (resulting in a split query), then the entire original connection field must be tracked.
If the GET is part of a write operation (PUT or DELETE), then skip past the cache entirely, but still save the results.
If we're at the top, always use real timeline start as a left window bound so that expansion arrow padding logic works.
Inputs come from command-line switches (--target, --dist-url), `process.version` and `process.release` where it exists.
It looks like a string literal, not an object literal, so treat it as a named template (which is allowed for rewriting)
It should not technically be optional in the Babel/Acorn AST format, but it must be optional in the Esprima AST format.
Make sure we set .type before any other properties (setting .value before .type means .value is lost in IE11 and below)
Many host objects are `Object` objects that can coerce to strings despite having improperly defined `toString` methods.
Methods are provided for adding edges (`appendEdge`, `prependEdge`, `addItems`) and removing them (`removeEdgeWithID`).
Note that options does NOT include 'encoding' this ensures that the return value is always a Buffer and never a string.
On certain platforms, this means that a native scroll has assumed control and the original touch targets are destroyed.
Once initialized, the ConnectionMultiplexer can be in one of 3 main states: running, break-disabled, and break-enabled.

Tells if a given comment is trailing: it starts on the current line and extends to or past the end of the current line.
The derived fields are calculated from the options, from the configuration values and even from chieldren's properties.
The public lifecycle API includes events for keyboard interaction, responder interaction, and scrolling (among others).
The second argument is the type object, which encodes all of the information required to marshal / unmarshal the value.
There are so many media events, it makes sense to just maintain a list rather than create a `trapBubbledEvent` for each
They can just handle serializing only the state (if they need serialization at all) by implementing `serializeState()`.
This data is commonly needed by many different interaction logic modules so precomputing it is very helpful to do once.
This event will not fire on an `touchEnd/mouseUp` event, only move events while the user is depressing the mouse/touch.
This function shouldn't be used, really, but it's pretty convenient sometimes, when you just want to work with a regex.
This influences support for strict mode, the set of reserved words, support for getters and setters and other features.
This is a temporary workaround that allow calculating important characters on the fly rather than relying on the index.
This is equivalent to the AST produced by `babel-relay-plugin` and is intended for use in serializing RelayQuery nodes.
This is not fully correct, since some scripts/fonts/browsers also treat other configurations of code points as a group.
This method's implementation was heavily influenced by the scanPunctuator function in the Esprima parser's source code.
This rule handles a given node as multiline when the closing parenthesis and the last element are not on the same line.
Unfortunately we have to support ES3 and cannot have `Map.prototype.size` be a getter method but just a regular method.
Wait for the promise to call the next chain That isn't synchrnously guranteed because it happens on `process.nextTick`.
We now have to re-walk the contents of the would-be class to re-translate any characters that were passed through as-is
We save the initial value so that `ReactDOMComponent` doesn't update `textContent` (unnecessary since we update value).
Were this schema executing on the server side, you could write a resolve method that fetches live data from a database.
When un/re-doing restores text containing marked spans, those that have been explicitly cleared should not be restored.
When we're responding to the user having checked/unchecked a checkbox, add/remove the element value to the model array.
Work out how much base64 we used, then drop all non-base64 chars from the beginning up to this point in the the string.
check the SHA of the package we have, to ensure it wasn't installed from somewhere other than the registry (eg, a fork)
context and single paged ids require getting children from the debuggee and converting them from dbgp to chrome format.
intervals get rescheduled when executed, so there's never more than a single scheduled function with a given timeoutKey
make sure this is an actual loop command by searching backwards to ensure it's not a string, comment or object property
we replace children with a new array object instead of mutating it because mutating it results in weird failure states.

Establish the root object, `window` (`self`) in the browser, `global` on the server, or `this` in some virtual machines.
Everything else is currently unsupported, most notably precision, unsigned numbers, non-decimal numbers, and characters.
Feel free to add to or remove from this list of extension modules to configure the precise type hierarchy that you need.
For all statusDisplays that existed in the previous iteration of the sequence, verify that the state has been preserved.

If the Set of selected items is new, like when navigating the tree with the arrow keys, scroll the first item into view.
If we get something that is not a buffer, string, null, or undefined, and we're not in objectMode, then that's an error.
Invoke the callback on just the original child paths, regardless of any modifications made to the array by the callback.
It has special keys `_args` (the remaining args from `argv`) and `_order` (gives the order that options were specified).
No API exists for adding breakpoints to source files that are not yet known, store it locally and try to add them later.
Note that regardless of `interspersed` the presence of '--' will stop option parsing, as all good option parsers should.
Note that this is a copy of the internal array used for storing the members so that no one can mess with internal state.
Note: This function is called only from parseObjectProperty(), where EOF and Punctuator tokens are already filtered out.
Note: This mirrors logic in the fs read operations that are employed during tarball creation, in the fstream-npm module.
Possible values: 'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).
Previously, we were doing simple string matching that would give us false positives when checking if paths were in PATH.
Primes the store by sending requests for any missing data that would be required to satisfy the supplied set of queries.
Prior to 0.4.1 you would have to specify the args in your range behaviors in the same order they appeared in your query.

S5.3 step 11 - "If the cookie store contains a cookie with the same name, domain, and path as the newly created cookie:"
Set this property to `false` to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.
Since the ScrollView is wrapped add the style props to the AndroidSwipeRefreshLayout and use flex: 1 for the ScrollView.
Since we need to serialize gadgets as placeholders, we can't let users define `serialize()` (which Atom calls) directly.
So here we temporarily walk around this by following hack, until https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9641 get addressed.
So let's disregard transforms, scrolling and relative layer positioning and choose the largest dimensions of all layers.
So to avoid calling _selectedNodeChanged() twice, first check if _selectedDOMNode is the same node as the one passed in.
Store a relative adjustment to the scroll position in the current operation (to be applied when the operation finishes).
TODO(ostrulovich) if we're really nice, we should probably check edit distance and suggest the right name the user meant
The clone methods suck in the new data and compute a diff for each row so ListView knows whether to re-render it or not.
The function will return all the default configuration functions overriden by those found on `rn-cli.config.js`, if any.
The toggle command first negates this, and then if this is true shows a datatip, otherwise it hides the current datatip.
The user should never get here because projects are inited by using `react-native-cli` from outside a project directory.
The writeFile endpoint accepts the following query parameters:  path: path to the file to read (it must be url encoded).
Therefore, if we detect that there was a change during the fetch we schedule another right after the first has finished.
These technically contain all the fields listed above, but we don't really have a good use for them so they are omitted.
These two private variables are accessed by outsiders because ListView uses them to iterate over the data in this class.
This allows a developer to provide an event object that can remove the listener (or listener map) during the invocation.
This is a very strange case in the AST where we are in a shorthand property but key and value do not have the same type.
This is meant to be overridden in specific implementations if you want specialized behavior for metadata (i.e. caching).
This is only needed for iOS, which puts the constants in the ViewManager namespace instead of UIManager, unlike Android.
This means that we need to avoid the state when same node node is contained in the .children map of several other nodes.
This meant that empty fields, would be stripped instead of being used to produce an intersection with the tracked query.
This way you can provide both, but tell Nuclide to ignore the `linter` provider so that duplicate results do not appear.

Unfortunately, this does not seem to kill Atom appropriately when the output of atom-script is piped to another process.
Vararg function that assumes that all elements except the last are numbers, as the last argument is a callback function.
We cannot perform a single traversal for the entire collection of events because each event may have a different target.
We have to be particularly careful of recursion with this mode because a root node can represent itself AND an ancestor.
We invoke require() in the context of a Domain so we can have multiple sets of modules running separate from each other.
Were React allowed to delete and creates nodes at its will it would have caused an abrupt stop in the scrolling process.

Despite being static, they must be defined outside of the "statics" key under which all other static methods are defined.
For example when editing a Working set all ancestors of a selected node must have either partial or a complete selection.
For style(object) or style(object, string), the object specifies the names and values of the attributes to set or remove.
If it wasn't returned, this means its status may have changed, in which case it should be removed from the hgStatusCache.

Initialize the directive, mixin definition properties, setup the watcher, call definition bind() and update() if present.
JSON.stringify and util.inspect have some collision potential as well, though less, and collision detection is expensive.
Like JavaScript's built-in Error class, but supports a "cause" argument which is wrapped, not "folded in" as with VError.
Looks for a node with the given URI in the sub branch - returns the deepest found ancesstor of the node being looked for.
Make the drawer take the entire screen and draw the background of the status bar to allow it to open over the status bar.
Mixed is safer than any, but that safety comes from Flow forcing you to inspect a mixed value at runtime before using it.
Mutations to this object fires off high level events to listeners such as UI controllers, giving them a chance to update.
Note that the children of an ElementRange may be aggregated into ranges whose size is larger than the debuggeee pagesize.
Now if the number is positive, you're pretty much done, you can just leverage the unsigned translations and return those.
On the selectionchange event, the target is just document which isn't helpful for us so just check activeElement instead.
Once the printer outputs plain values the filter step can be removed or simplified (might want to still filter metadata).
Once we provide all diagnostics, instead of just the current file, we can probably remove the activeTextEditor parameter.
Otherwise bring back whatever was previously saved (if anything), falling back to the empty string if nothing was stored.
Otherwise, return a function that always gets the latest binding value and registers a dependency on the binding updater.

Test whether there exists a collapsed span that partially overlaps (covers the start or end, but not both) of a new span.
That said, although this attribute improves things, the resulting styles still do not match exactly what you see in Atom.
The items in this array are not fetchable by ID, so nothing else could have fetched additional data for individual items.
These are JSHint boolean options which are shared with JSLint where the name has been changed but the effect is unchanged
This code changes such instances back 'var' and 'closure' so that the code in JSHINT.data() doesn't think they're unused.
This is a silly query (we don't need the `first(1)` call here) but was seen in the wild and should be handled gracefully.
This problem does not impact ASAP because Safari 6.0 supports mutation observers, so that implementation is used instead.
This test also verifies that if multiple transitions are created at the same time, the last transition becomes the owner.
To make sure we only have one copy of sessionId, we store it as a property of `global` object with SESSION_ID_KEY as key.

all *.gyp files are renamed to binding.gyp for node-gyp but only when they are in the same folder as a package.json file.
don't include anything that's always handled just fine in the normal header, or only meaningful in the context of nodetar

We only handle completions in which non-placeholder and placeholder chunks alternate, starting with non-placeholder chunk.
We probably want to replace all existing uses of "get", replace them with "doGet()", and then rename "doGet()" to "get()".
We use `concat` to create a new array - mutating `this._data`, e.g. with `this._data.push(newRowData)`, would be an error.

When there are more than three length categories, an outer switch first dispatches on the lengths, to save on comparisons.
if the reader is waiting for a drain event from this specific writer, then it would cause it to never start flowing again.
jsc doesn't play so well with tracebacks that go into eval'd code, so the stack trace here will stop at the `eval()` call.
optimist default API requires you to write the command name three time This is a small wrapper to accept an object instead
we fire _end internally *after* end, so that we don't move on until any "end" listeners have had their chance to do stuff.
(Currently all move have the same timeStamp, but later we should add some threshold for what is considered to be "moving").

NOTE: this method currently ignores the passed-in text, and instead diffs against the currently saved contents of the file.
Non zero offset implies this block is neither a removal or an addition, and is thus equal in both versions of the document.
Note that this is date will be displayed in the local time zone of the viewer rather than that of the author of the commit.

Remove any tree elements that no longer have this node as their parent and save all existing elements that could be reused.
Reports `import`, `export`, `as`, and `from` keywords of a given node if usage of spacing around those keywords is invalid.
Since the browser may natively replace the target node during composition, we can use its position to find its replacement.
Since the input might not even be in a form, let's just use the global `querySelectorAll` to ensure we don't miss anything.
Starting from the given a node (a property.key node here) looks forward until it finds the colon punctuator and returns it.
TODO (t8045823) Convert the return type of ::getBlameAtHead to a Map when the service framework supports a Map return type.
TODO: When HHVM handles the 'stop' message correctly, we don't need to await this promise, and we can delete this if check.
The following default field values are used in the payload: important: false parsedOk: true implicit: false disabled: false
The toggle command first negates this, and then if this is true shows a type hint, otherwise it hides the current typehint.
The top node is always a branch node, and is the document object itself (meaning it has additional methods and properties).
These two are, on init, called from the constructor because they have to be initialized before the editor can start at all.
This code would be cleaner if the drawer layout provided an `isOpen` prop and allowed us to pass a `onDrawerClose` handler.
This is not a controlled component*, e.g. if you don't update the value, the component won't be reset to its initial value.
This method's implementation was heavily influenced by the scanNumericLiteral function in the Esprima parser's source code.
Use a custom d3.transform to parse a decomposed transform, since JSDOM doesn't support consolidating SVG transform strings.
Value x means that (1 - x) fraction of the page at "position" index is visible, and x fraction of the next page is visible.
We did not find the exact element, and there is no next-closest element than the one we are searching for, so we return -1.
When the value is a function, the function is still evaluated only once per element even if there are multiple class names.
When we open a file for the first time, make sure we pass 'clean' to getDiagnostics to reset any server state for the file.
Whether or not we are updating children of navigator and if so (not `null`) which index marks the beginning of all updates.

cURL command expected to run on the same platform that DevTools run (it may be different from the inspected page platform).
current is optionally the current stat, provided here so that subclasses can avoid statting the target more than necessary.
ranges of * ALWAYS count as a match, because when downloading we allow prereleases to match * if there are ONLY prereleases
the value is an array, it should produce a URI like /Table/(4,5,8) and store.get() should handle that as an array of values
we always consider deps provided by a shrinkwrap as "correct" or else we'll subvert them if they're intentionally "invalid"
Allow code injection via the URL OR load code from localStorage OR prime the playground with some default 'hello world' code
As a result, `touchableHandlePress` will be called when lifting up, even if `touchableHandleLongPress` has also been called.

Group the parameter names so that all of the trailing optional parameters are together with the last non-optional parameter.
Gutter.destroy seems to fail after text editor is destroyed, and Gutter.onDidDestroy doesn't seem to be called in that case.
I chose these semantics over cleverly invoking the callback on new elements because this way is much easier to reason about.
IE6 sometimes throws "unknown error" if you try to write to .selected directly, whereas Firefox struggles with setAttribute.

If you do out the computations:  0xffff - 128 + 1 0xffff - 127 0xff80  You can then encode this value as the signed version.
In older browsers we can't create a null-prototype object so we have to defend against key collisions with built-in methods.
Instead, send the HMR updates right away and clear the bundles cache so that if the user reloads we send them a fresh bundle
It also keeps cowboy devs at bay from introducing exotic syntax, stage 0 features, and/or obscene module systems like Haste.
It exists from the moment the quick-open UI becomes visible until it gets closed, either via file selection or cancellation.
It is set on all token types that can be followed by an expression (thus, a slash after them would be a regular expression).
Mapping from lowercase registration names to the properly cased version, used to warn in the case of missing event handlers.
Note that even if the browser supports DOMTokenList, it probably doesn't support it on SVG elements (which can be animated).
Note that the visitor object is the prototype of Context.prototype, so all visitor methods are inherited by context objects.
Note:** This function only supports cloning values with tags of `Boolean`, `Date`, `Error`, `Number`, `RegExp`, or `String`.
Older versions of IE throws unspecified error when touching document.activeElement in some cases (during loading, in iframe)

The paths are returned in absolute from code analysis tools but github works on paths relative from the root of the project.
The reprinting code leaves leading whitespace untouched unless it has to reindent a line, or you pass false for this option.
The summary output we get should be unfiltered, showing everything installed, so we clear these options before calling `ls`.
There are a number of idiomatic ways of expressing types, so this function serves to coerce them all to actual Type objects.
They are opaque tokens that are used by Relay containers to read data that is then passed to the underlying React component.
This "getter" function checks if the index has previosly been "set", and if so returns the index * the value previously set.
This is coordinated outside this component so the parent can syncronize this re-render with managing the placeholder sizing.
This is used to: - Determine if the scroll view has been scrolled and therefore should refuse to give up its responder lock.
This is useful when performing operations that could remove dom nodes and place them back in, resulting in focus being lost.
This makes it possible for get-def to operate on the unsaved content in the user's editor rather than what is saved on disk.
This performs the same function as the `cloneWithRows` function but here you also specify what your `sectionIdentities` are.
Unfortunately, page-title-set never seems to fire, so we listen for frame loads and update the title based on those instead.
Use `renderComponent` in `beforeEach` to return the component so the test methods have a chance to modify the default props.
We avoid the cracks by checking slightly above and slightly below the mouse and seeing if we hit the same element each time.
We do not cache the result of this check because we have unit tests that temporarily redefine the value of process.platform.
We generate random numbers for React root IDs and if there's a collision the events and DOM update system will get confused.
What we have here, is three divs with refs (div1/2/3), but a single moving cursor ref `hopRef` that "hops" around the three.
While restore opened files, the remote port might have been changed if the server restarted after upgrade or user killed it.
`ReactInstanceMap` maintains a mapping from a public facing stateful instance (key) and the internal representation (value).
runAllTimers doesn't actually run all timers with nested timer functions inside Promises, so we have to call it extra times.
this is an example of using npm.commands.search programmatically to fetch data that has been filtered by a set of arguments.
'file': The 'filePaths' option determines which files' messages to clear 'project': all 'project' scope messages are cleared.
As of jQuery 1.7.1, jQuery parses the HTML by appending it to some dummy parent nodes held in an in-memory document fragment.
Assuming our invariants hold, if this case fires, that means that there is more than one status bar provider, which is weird.
Avoid duplicate updates and avoid moving the status away from FAILED, to let any existing work die out when the server fails.
Caution: if `circular` is false and `parent` contains circular references, your program may enter an infinite loop and crash.
Complex objects that are passed are expected to have a top-level `id` attribute, which is used for later lookup + inspection.
Convenience method that attaches a DOM event listener to the directive element and autometically tears it down during unbind.

If the server's certs has been updated or there is no previous successful connection, null (resolved by promise) is returned.
If there's a baseUrl, then use it as the base URL (i.e. uri must be specified as a relative path and is appended to baseUrl).
If we clean up the buffer before the `openUriInPane` finishes, the pane will be closed, because it could have no other items.
If you'd like to manage it in some other way (e.g. Flux), just call `this.forceUpdate()` whenever your store's state changes.
Ignore all non-export top level program elements including: imports, statements, variable declarations, function declarations
Internal instances should fully constructed at this point, so they should not get any new fields added to them at this point.
Invoked when the item is "active" (in that it is still eligible to become a "select") but the touch has left the `PressRect`.
It returns a minimal set of queries that will fulfill the difference, or an empty array if the query can be resolved locally.
It's possible for state to be mutable but such change should trigger an update of the owner which would recreate the element.

The "stall" time is defined as the amount of time in access of the acceptable threshold, which is typically around 100-200ms.
The following two methods are the only places we need to integrate Bootstrap or jQuery with the components lifecycle methods.
The method updates the child to the new node (which create a new parent instance) and call recursively for the parent update.
The old and new text editor contents use offsets to create a global line number identifier being the line number with offset.
The print function is the right choice because it gives us the opportunity to reprint such nodes using their original source.
Therefore, we include the Systrace module before the main module, and it will set itself as property on the require function.
These annotations are copy/pasted from the built-in Flow definitions for Native Promises with some non-standard APIs added in
These characters have special meaning to the parser and must not appear in the middle of a token, except as part of a string.
This function takes a previous set of keys and a new set of keys and merges them with its best guess of the correct ordering.

Uses a set of changes plus the current scroll position to determine which DOM updates have to be made, and makes the updates.
Utility Functions ----------------- Run Underscore.js in *noConflict* mode, returning the `_` variable to its previous owner.
We accept any tag to be rendered but since this gets injected into arbitrary HTML, we want to make sure that it's a safe tag.
When listener(s) are available those callbacks are invoked, otherwise the "*" event is emitted and those actions are invoked.
When mounting, calls to `setState` by `componentWillMount` will set `this._pendingStateQueue` without triggering a re-render.
When the scroll view is disabled, this defines how far your touch may move off of the button, before deactivating the button.
hasNumericValue: Whether the property must be numeric or parse as a numeric and should be removed when set to a falsey value.

skip the regexp for non-magical patterns unescape anything in it, though, so that it'll be an exact match against a file etc.
"If the cookie's http-only-flag is true, then exclude the cookie if the cookie-string is being generated for a "non-HTTP" API"
'touch' is the least permissive invalidation strategy: It will invalidate for changes that touch the marked region in any way.

But let's at least keep the local cache updated.) In this case, we just want to remove the deleted file if it is in the cache.
Do not remove old categories if not handling a user gesture, as there's chance categories will be added later during start-up.
Ensure we have the right element, and that the user is not dragging a selection (this matches native `select` event behavior).
FIXME: there used to be registry completion here, but it stopped making sense somewhere around 50,000 packages on the registry
FireFox implements `key` but returns `MozPrintableKey` for all printable characters (normalized to `Unidentified`), ignore it.
Having too many tests running concurrently on saucelabs causes timeouts and errors, so we have to run them in smaller batches.
If the test runner is debuggable, and the user has checked the box, then we will launch the debugger before running the tests.
If we did traverse, this fragment reference would lead us to create an object with a __dataID__ instead of the desired `null`.
If you *are* setting the userconfig explicitly then it will override your explicit intent, and that IS harmful and unexpected.
If you are looking for a function that creates an Array instance based on an "Array-like" object, use createArrayFrom instead.
In order to retrieve the image dimensions, the image may first need to be loaded or downloaded, after which it will be cached.
In this way, writing to Error.prepareStackTrace will put the new prepareStackTrace functions in a wrapper that calls the hook.

Note the native date picker dialog has some UI glitches on Android 4 and lower when using the `minDate` and `maxDate` options.
Note: A self closing tag gets its own scope, but a non-self closing tag will use the scope opened up in the parent JSXElement.

Responder being granted: ------------------------  - Touch starts, moves, and scrolls can cause an ID to become the responder.
Set the text content of the first node after the opening comment, and remove all following nodes up until the closing comment.
So, let's blacklist conservatively for now and we can add cases later if we observe Flow crashes that do not fit this pattern.
The Relay backend implements this call and is initialized from the injected script whereas this file is called from the Panel.
The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

The base implementation of `_.keys` which doesn't skip the constructor property of prototypes or treat sparse arrays as dense.
The key concept is that marshalling functions can be recursive, calling other marshalling functions, ending at the primitives.
The major downside of using request instead of our hand-rolled implementation is that it has a lot of dependencies of its own.
The mapping object should have the following properties:  - generated: An object with the generated line and column positions.
The source can't be part of the message because we want to be able to populate a filter menu before we even have any messages.
The system should check `isPersistent` to determine whether the event should be released into the pool after being dispatched.
There are two additional methods for controlling the traversal:  - `traverse(parent, state)`: Visits all children of `parent`.
These arrays only have two items show up in the AST, so we need to look at the token to verify that there's no dangling comma.
These should be set up in the constructor, but as a convenience for simpler class abstractions, we set them up after the fact.
This ensures that the hackery done here doesn't break future Nuclide compatibility with Atom, or tooling like flow and eslint.
This is done without actually changing the view hierarchy, and in general is easy to add to an app without weird side-effects.
This test can't actually perform a search because path-search uses watchman and we don't have a good way to mock dependencies.
Unterminated `patternNode` is the same as containing every descendant sub-field, so `subjectNode` must be in the intersection.
Use this for the top level methods that result in large amounts of computation/mutations that would need to be safety checked.
We should not cache results for files that failed, in order to guarantee that next execution will process those files as well.
Web desktop polyfills only need to construct a fake touch event with identifier 0, also abandoning traditional click handlers.
`nextIndex` will increment for each child in `nextChildren`, but `lastIndex` will be the last index visited in `prevChildren`.
because of weirdness in react-routers match function we replace the wrapped returned in props with the first one we passed in.
because rootMarkup is retrieved from the DOM, various normalizations will have occurred which will not be present in `markup`.
check if picture was found check if user has no picture check if user has default picture set user.picture from oauth provider
hasSelection will be the case when there is a lot of text in the textarea, in which case reading its value would be expensive.
make sure to add the child with correct parent if this is a transcluded component, its parent should be the transclusion host.
props could contain dashes, which will be interpreted as minus calculations by the parser so we need to camelize the path here
the filter regex check might give false positive for pipes inside strings, so it's possible that we don't get any filters here
- A component created via React.createClass() - Has a single child subComponent - the return value from the .render() function.
/: Once the environment supports Proxies, we shoulds switch to them (so that we're not trampling on the component's namespace).
@return An Object with some details about the output of the command: pid: The process id of the running app, if 'run' was true.
@return HyperclickMatch if (textEditor, position) identifies a file path that resolves to a file under the specified directory.
Also unregister that callback if it was a one time timer (setTimeout), and not unregister it if it was recurring (setInterval).
An interpolation maps input ranges to output ranges, typically using a linear interpolation but also supports easing functions.
As "clean" as that solution is, watchers require setting up, and are a departure from how the Atom development ecosystem works.
At this point the negotiation events have been dispatched as part of the extraction process, but not the side effectful events.

Don't "declare class exports" directly, otherwise in error messages our show up as "exports" instead of "Map" or "MapPolyfill".
Don't "declare class exports" directly, otherwise in error messages our show up as "exports" instead of "Set" or "SetPolyfill".
During execution the body wrapper will be passed the correct values whereas during the annotator the arguments don't exist yet.
Each mutation corresponds to a field on the server which is used by clients to communicate the type of mutation to be executed.
For example, as decimals: 1 becomes 2 (10 binary), -1 becomes 3 (11 binary) 2 becomes 4 (100 binary), -2 becomes 5 (101 binary)
For example, as decimals: 2 (10 binary) becomes 1, 3 (11 binary) becomes -1 4 (100 binary) becomes 2, 5 (101 binary) becomes -2
Gets the DOM ID of the React component that is the root of the tree that contains the React component with the supplied DOM ID.
Ideally, if multiple subfolders of an Hg repo are used as project roots in Atom, only one HgRepositoryClient should be created.
If the exact position the target in the file cannot be determined position property of the target location will be set to null.
If the file ends in /, then it can only match a a pattern that ends in /, unless the pattern just doesn't have any more for it.
If there are not enough substitutions for the current substitutionIndex just output the format specifier literally and move on.
If this is the view that was last serialized, render synchronously and immediately so the side-bar appears quickly on start up.
If we find a key character on the starting line, then the user is typing a single-line method (it doesn't need to be indented).
It also indexes by height, and is used to convert between height and line object, and to find the total height of the document.
Now that the initial VCS statuses are set, subscribe to changes to the Repository so that the VCS statuses are kept up to date.
Optimized version of general operation applications that can be used when the target matrix is known to be the identity matrix.
Run the given mode's parser over a line, update the styles array, which contains alternating fragments of text and CSS classes.
Since previous versions didn't check for Content-Encoding header, ignore any invalid values to preserve backwards-compatibility
The await here is subtle, it ensures that the shutdown call is sent on the socket before the socket is closed on the next line.
The returned Promise is resolved with null if another showPanel() gets called while this.panel(panelName) Promise is in flight.
This callback gets called whenever there is a text editor event, such as a file save, that should trigger a run of diagnostics.
This is intended as a generic filter module and therefore contains no special logic for handling requisite or generated fields.
This logic protects us from incorrect indices passed from above, and allows us to passively account for profiles being deleted.
This property will be used as the internal size variable to disallow writing and to issue warnings for writings in development.
This terribly fragile set of tests matches the character combinations that suffer from this phenomenon on the various browsers.
Thus, `textInput` is the best available event to identify the characters that have actually been inserted into the target node.
Unfortunately we can't elegantly reuse isFunction and isString, here, because this code is executed while defining those types.
Utility to make it easier to register a file extension with a grammar, overwriting existing registrations or adding duplicates.
We do not show "scroll beyond end of file" span for one line documents, so we need to check if "document has one line" changed.
We hide the horizontal overflow in the PanelComponent because the presence of the scrollbar throws off our height calculations.
When the "+" button is clicked (the user intends to add a new connection profile), open a new dialog with a form to create one.
While `parent` is still responder, we create new handlers that verify the ordering of propagation, restarting the count at `0`.
Worse, Flow will assume that *any* string key will yield a valid ServerStatus result, so we won't get protection against typos.
based on transition type: - transition: remove class now, wait for transitionend, then done if there's no explicit js callback.
create the two objects needed to store the corked requests they are not a linked list, as no new elements are inserted in there
this is necessary because if we set it on props, even when empty, it'll trigger the default pull-to-refresh behavior on native.
this will listen to traffic on port 1337 The purpose is to redirect any user who is direct to https instead of http by mistake.
use step hook for back compat - use cssHook if its there - use .style if its available and use plain properties where available
very conservative rule (eg: only one space between the start of the comment and the first character) to relax the maxlen option
we ignore errors here, because they can legitimately happen, for instance, bundled modules will be in both node_modules folders

But refs rely on it -- so we check that we can find a ref at arbitrary points in the tree, even if other nodes don't have a ref.
By default, Underscore uses ERB-style template delimiters, change the following template settings to use alternative delimiters.
Checks if `value` is in `cache` mimicking the return signature of `_.indexOf` by returning `0` if the value is found, else `-1`.
Decodes the next base 64 VLQ value from the given string and returns the value and the rest of the string via the out parameter.
Ensures that, when possible, the selection range (currently selected text input) is not disturbed by performing the transaction.
Fixing jsdom's quirky behavior -- in reality, the parser should strip off the leading newline but we need to do it by hand here.
For methods which are defined more than once, call the existing methods before calling the new property, merging if appropriate.
For node-create mutations, maintains an index of the mutation to the client ID of an optimistically created node (if it exists).
General constructor for creating RelayGraphQLMutation instances with optional `files`, `callbacks` and `collisionKey` arguments.
Global runtime evaluation on dummy connection does not care about which frame it is being evaluated on so choose top frame here.
If a gen function is supplied, then the promise it returns will block execution of tasks already in the queue until it resolves.
If a paint doesn't have a corresponding graphics layer id, it paints into its parent so add an effectivePaintId to these events.
If it  ncounters a node that is not in `cachedRecords`, it will queued that node by adding it into the `pendingNodeStates` list.
If it's the only child, treat the name as if it was wrapped in an array so that it's consistent if the number of children grows.
If the expected value is a Date object, the actual value is equivalent if it is also a Date object that refers to the same time.
If the user requested help, show the command's help Do the same if the actual command is a group of other commands (e.g.: cache)
If there are one or more projects set previously, this replaces them all with the one(s) provided as the argument `projectPath`.
If there is dataShow left over from a stopped hide or show and we are going to proceed with show, we should pretend to be hidden
If we have a valid `dataID`, ensure that a record is created for it even if we do not actually end up populating it with fields.
If we were successful, then we know the item is up-to-date, so there's no need to update it and we can move on to the next item.
Images are stored in memory only, and must be manually deleted when you are finished with them by calling `removeImageForTag()`.
In case of redirect request id is reassigned to a redirected request and we need to update _nodesByRequestId and search results.
In this case we need to listen for incoming connections to attach to, as well as on the port that the dummy connection will use.
Instead of showing the user a bunch of un-mounted blank space, WLV sets contentInset to prevent scrolling into unrendered areas.
Invoked by ReactTestUtils.Simulate so that any errors thrown by the event handler are sure to be rethrown by rethrowCaughtError.
It also allows the ability to add new primitives, ranging from Buffer to NuclideUri that are not handled at the transport layer.
It should technically live in core's test suite but I'll leave it here to indicate that this is an issue that needs to be fixed.
Make a caret selection inside the new element if there isn't a range selection and there isn't already a caret selection inside.
Mutates and returns a nested `SplitQueries` structure, updating any deferred "ref queries" to actually reference their contexts.
Note: this a generic base implementation of __iterate in terms of __iterator which may be more generically useful in the future.
One `Animated.Value` can drive multiple properties in a synchronized fashion, but can only be driven by one mechanism at a time.
Returns a Promise which will be invoked an object containing `action`, `hour` (0-23), `minute` (0-59) if the user picked a time.
Returns a function that is the composition of a list of functions, each consuming the return value of the function that follows.
Shared markers (across linked documents) are handled separately (markTextShared will call out to this again, once per document).
Simulate the providers serializing their own state -- they would start out hidden if we exited Nuclide in distraction-free-mode.
So, ignore any nodes that have already been removed, and include any nodes that have been inserted among the previous collection
Store a mapping from function name to a structure holding both the local implementation and the type definition of the function.
Streams a fired top-level event to `EventPluginHub` where plugins have the opportunity to create `ReactEvent`s to be dispatched.

TODO: - on "end", a callback hook for `onResponderEndShouldRemainResponder` that determines if the responder lock should remain.
Tests that scripts tab is populated with inspected scripts even if it hadn't been shown by the moment inspected paged refreshed.
The `size` property on a map object is a regular property and not a computed property on the prototype as described by the spec.
The drawer can be locked in 3 states: - unlocked (default), meaning that the drawer will respond (open/close) to touch gestures.
The empty .build() here means that an EmptyStatement can be constructed (i.e. it's not abstract) but that it needs no arguments.
The function sets the directories (terminated by a separator) as keys in the `directories` Map, and bumps the value accordingly.
The only reason to modify this file is to add more warnings and troubleshooting information for the `react-native init` command.
This component is used to wrap strings in elements so that they can undergo the same reconciliation that is applied to elements.
This is currently used to help focus on child textviews, but can also be used to quickly scroll to any element we want to focus.
This is not called by default due to perf overhead but it's useful if you want to find traces which spend too much time in JSON.
This is stronger than any kind of break, a break will not happen if a noBreak is within the break's contiguous chain of markers.
This was fixed in io.js version 1.5.0 As of 2015-07-20, it is still unfixed in node: https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/25657
Underscore templating handles arbitrary delimiters, preserves whitespace, and correctly escapes quotes within interpolated code.
We don't need to dispose of the contextDisposable when the provider is disabled - it needs to be handled by the provider itself.
We run all of our assertions twice: once for finish, once for close There are 6 assertions, two fixed, plus 4 lines in the file.
We use concatMap instead of flatMap to ensure that the order doesn't change, in case one event takes especially long to marshal.
We want to override the extra space within the first node of a class body, so we do one hard break and then throw in a no break.
When a top-level event is fired, this method is expected to extract synthetic events that will in turn be queued and dispatched.
When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb) internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes buffered up.
in order to honor the cacheFile option if specified this option should not have a default value otherwise it will always be used
invoke the ArrayIndex internal `set` operator to ensure that there's getters/setters defined for the determined length so far...
multiSet and multiMerge take arrays of key-value array pairs that match the output of multiGet, e.g. Returns a `Promise` object.
the debug module is configured globally, we need to enable debugging before* requiring any packages that use `debug` for logging
there are some very rare and pathological edge-cases where a cycle can cause npm to try to install a never-ending tree of stuff.
this is necessary so that the fragment can keep track of its contained components in order to call attach/detach hooks for them.
@return An Observable that returns output from buck, as described by the docblocks for `buildWithOutput` and `installWithOutput`.
A map from each file that has messages from any diagnostic provider to the set of diagnostic providers that have messages for it.
Although message channels yield to any queued rendering and IO tasks, they would be better than imposing the 4ms delay of timers.
By default, `PanResponder` holds an `InteractionManager handle to block long-running JS events from interrupting active gestures.
CHILDREN HANDLING In order for the tree traversal and modifications to be efficient one often needs to find the parent of a node.
Calling path.get("child") multiple times always returns the same child Path object, for both performance and consistency reasons.
Checks whether a set of calls on a connection supply enough information to fetch the range fields (i.e. `edges` and `page_info`).
Dbgp protocol does not seem to support uncaught exception handling so we only support 'all' and treat all other states as 'none'.
Do this after creating the global so that if an AMD module wants to call noConflict to hide this version of jQuery, it will work.
Due to a previous bug in the sshPort type, we may need to do this cast to correct bad state that was persisted in users' configs.
Extension: Intended for developers who want to provide both interfaces to cater towards people who use only the `linter` package.
For each line in the refs, extract only the heads Organize them in an object where keys are branches and values the commit hashes
Fragments can be skipped because these will always be composed into, and therefore tracked by, their nearest non-fragment parent.
Ideally this should be executed as a microtask, so we leverage MutationObserver if it's available, and fallback to setTimeout(0).
If one of the callbacks throw an error, the execution will be aborted and the returned promise be rejected with the thrown error.
If the term ends in a word character (a-z0-9_), ensure a word boundary at the end, so that substrings do not get falsely matched.
If tool-bar is disabled, stop updating the button state and remove tool-bar related cleanup from this package's disposal actions.
If you do not need precise scroll position tracking, set this value higher to limit the information being sent across the bridge.
It can be a superset of the actual response payload if certain fields that are affected have not been queried by the client, yet.
It requires each resolver defined in config.resolvers and calls its "match" to check if given resolves supports given decEndpoint
Its type is one of ObjectExpression, ObjectPattern, ArrayExpression, ArrayPattern, ImportDeclaration, and ExportNamedDeclaration.
Like most implementations of mkdirp, if it fails, it is possible that directories were created for some prefix of the given path.
Log error and mark the directory as dirty so the failed subscription will be attempted again next time the directory is expanded.
Look here: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/master/pkg/nuclide-diagnostics-provider-base/ for a complete list of options.
Mutating the event's members allows us to not have to create a wrapping "dispatch" object that pairs the event with the listener.
NOTE: if request was called as `http.request(options, cb)` then there is one action, which we can't detect in handleHttpResponse.
Node.js does not return get/set property descriptors now (v0.11.11), therefore we can't fully implement 'accessorPropertiesOnly'.
On Mac Os X / macports there's only the ossp-uuid package that provides uuid On Linux there's uuid-runtime which provides uuidgen
Only use the user's last saved remote server command if there has been no change (upgrade) in the official remote server command.
Prevents the path to the current file to be prepended, so that the overwritten XHR.open can properly prepend the new path prefix.
Re-enable Atom's bundled 'tree-view' when this package is disabled to leave the user's environment the way this package found it.
Remove parameters from the previous response, unless this is the second request for a server that requires digest authentication.
Resolves synchronously if already resolved, otherwise resolves asynchronously and caches the resolved constructor on the factory.
Returns an array of logical lines that continue the visual line started by the argument, or undefined if there are no such lines.
Rhino's regular expression parser is flaky and throws uncatchable exceptions, so don't do detection if we are running under Rhino
Select the final connection profile in the list because one of the above conditions means the current selected index is outdated.
So instead we track any node that the context is attached to, and dispose the computed when all of those nodes have been cleaned.
TaskQueue instances are self contained and independent, so multiple tasks of varying semantics and priority can operate together.
The MarshallingContext is opaque to the TypeRegistry and allows for adding per-connection context to marshalling transformations.
The _direct propery is saved by the manager when .newly is specified It may happen pkgMeta is undefined if package is uninstalled
The `compositeConnectionProfiles` is the combination of the default connection profile plus any user-created connection profiles.
The controller uses the currently active file to decide when and what to reveal in the file tree when revealActiveFile is called.
The id field should not technically be optional in the Esprima AST format, but it must be optional in the Babel/Acorn AST format.
The test function is applied sequentially to each element in items until one returns a Promise that resolves to a non-null value.
This can still be an instance in case of factory components but we'll count this as time spent rendering as the more common case.
This means that there are rare edge cases where one JavaScript engine complains about your regular expression while others don't.
This should also be the path prefix checked by the handler we register with `atom.project.registerOpener()` to open remote files.
This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side, since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.
Utility for applying a change to a line by handle or number, returning the number and optionally registering the line as changed.
When bindings are static (won't be updated because of a binding context update), just return the value accessor from the binding.
When capturing/bubbling the "shouldSet" event, we want to skip the target (deepest ID) if it happens to be the current responder.
When something is selected, it is present in the textarea, and selected (unless it is huge, in which case a placeholder is used).
When true, the scroll view bounces vertically when it reaches the end even if the content is smaller than the scroll view itself.
`RecentFileService` listens for `onWorkspaceDidStopChangingActivePaneItem`, which debounces calls to `onDidChangeActivePaneItem`.
create a new export function, used by both the main export and the .ctor export, contains common logic for dealing with arguments
if we request more results but get the same number, we replace (in case there were deleted items, different items, or reordering)
this looks simpler, and is strictly *faster*, but will tie up the JavaScript thread and fail on excessively deep directory trees.
(With old-style refs, it's impossible to get a ref to this div because Wrapper is the current owner when this function is called.)
- data is passed down via `scope`, which flows from a parent field down through intermediary fragments to the nearest child field.
@param A callback that will be called immediately with any stored data, and called whenever the BufferedProcessStore has new data.
Check for protocol - the remote check for hosts supporting shallow cloning is only required for HTTP or HTTPS, not for Git or SSH.
Checks that an assignment to an identifier only assigns 'this' to the appropriate alias, and the alias is only assigned to 'this'.
Do a bulk-read of the DOM positions and sizes needed to draw the view, so that we don't interleave reading and writing to the DOM.
Does not check if a matching directory entry is a file, and intentionally only searches for the first file name in this.fileNames.
Don't use `actions.expandNode` because it causes a re-render, which queues a real fetch and might populate the children of `dir1`.
Each child view of the `ViewPagerAndroid` will be treated as a separate page and will be stretched to fill the `ViewPagerAndroid`.
Example: A browser system caches DOM nodes based on component ID and must remove that cache entry when this instance is unmounted.
Executes the provided `callback` once for each enumerable own property in the object and constructs a new object from the results.
Fake originalEvent to avoid donor's stopPropagation, but if the simulated event prevents default then we do the same on the donor.
Find out if any of the individual longhand properties of the shorthand are used, if none are then the shorthand is overloaded too.
Functions like coordsChar, that need to do a lot of measurements in a row, can thus ensure that the set-up work is only done once.
Handlers: Subclasses of `RelayCacheProcessor` can implement this method to actually perform work after a root/node read completes.
If all of the children are needed it's easier to return as promise, to make the caller oblivious to the way children were fetched.
If coordinating scrolling with keyboard movement, always* use these hooks instead of listening to your own global keyboard events.
If iterable.size is undefined, the size of the realized sliceSeq is unknown at this point unless the number of items to slice is 0
If the parent context is watching any obsevables, the new child context will automatically get a dependency on the parent context.
In the future this may be used to indicate that required data for the fragment has not been fetched or was evicted from the cache.
It would be annoying if the user had to save before using the jump-to-definition feature to ensure he or she got accurate results.
Like `Rx.Observable.fromPromise`, but the resulting Observable sequence does not automatically complete once the promise resolves.
Lines with gutter elements, widgets or a background class need to be wrapped, and have the extra elements added to the wrapper div
Merge all the properties of source into target, source wins in conflict, and by default null and undefined from source are applied
Note that rows must be the same height when they are re-mounted as when they are unmounted otherwise the content will jump around.
Once the connection is re-established, the `onDidAddRemoteConnection` logic above will restore the editor contents as appropriate.
Otherwise, you would always wonder if the scroll responder is currently in a state where it recognizes new keyboard positions etc.
Quick object check - this is primarily used to tell Objects from primitive values when we know the value is a JSON-compliant type.
Record index of the last subscriber so we do not later unintentionally invoke callbacks that were subscribed after this broadcast.
Returns `true` if the feature with the given name is disabled either directly or because the 'nuclide' package itself is disabled.
Set to true if this is an 'arrayOf' type that collects multiple usages of the option in process.argv and puts results in an array.
Since we're now later in the nested arrays our value is more important so we need to calculate it and override the existing value.
TODO(jonaldislarry): Currently xdebug provides no way to eval at arbitrary stack depths, it only supports the current stack frame.
The `jsApiReporter` also receives spec results, and is used by any environment that needs to extract the results  from JavaScript.
The invariant message will be stripped in production, but the invariant will remain to ensure logic does not differ in production.
The newNode is assumed to be prevNode after some manipulateion done to it therefore they are assumed to belong to the same parent.
The only job of react-native-cli is to init the repository and then forward all the commands to the local version of react-native.
The only other requirement is that the `pageX, pageY` values be in the same coordinate system that events' `pageX/Y` are reported.
These identifiers are useful for assigning response payloads to their corresponding queries when sent in a single GraphQL request.
This component contains the entire view in which the user inputs their connection information when connecting to a remote project.
This function checks that the required inputs to a connection profile are non-empty (i.e. required strings are at least length 1).
This is extended further to allow Objects to describe the values they represent, by way of `valueOf` or `equals` (and `hashCode`).
This is required as Atom's builtin coffeescript package need to show coffeescript stacktrace by customize Error.prepareStackTrace.
This registry keeps track of the React IDs of the components that rendered to `null` (in reality a placeholder such as `noscript`)
This test exists to protect against implementation details that incorrectly query escaped IDs using DOM tools like getElementById.
While user keyboard layout determines the actual meaning of each `keyCode` value, almost all function keys have a universal value.
test if name starts with hike/waypoint/basejump/zipline fix for bug that saved different challenges with incorrect challenge types
- Consider caching this for the lifetime of the component, or possibly being able to share this cache between any `ScrollMap` view.
- Non-spacing and enclosing combining characters (general category code Mn or Me in the Unicode database) have a column width of 0.
Add --one option to `apm test` to ensure no deprecated APIs are used: http://blog.atom.io/2015/05/01/removing-deprecated-apis.html.
Bidirectional ordering algorithm See http://unicode.org/reports/tr9/tr9-13.html for the algorithm that this (partially) implements.
By default, a gutter will be destroyed when its editor is destroyed, so there is no need to register a callback via onDidDestroy().
Emits a destroy event that's used to unmount the attached React component and invalidate the cached view instance of the Diff View.
Expand the .loc of the node responsible for printing the decorators (here, the decorated node) so that it includes node.decorators.
FIXME: find a way of generating this mapping or getting it from combination of LayoutStyleConstants and CSSSelector.cpp at runtime.
Files are related if they have the same filename but different extension, or if the filename is appended with `Internal` or `-inl`.
Finally, the literal on the left side must be less than or equal to the literal on the right side so that the test makes any sense.
Find the mapping that best matches the hypothetical "needle" mapping that we are searching for in the given "haystack" of mappings.
If it's determined that a component should not update, we still want to set props and state but we shortcut the rest of the update.
If the element has a class name or if we're passed "false", then remove the whole classname (if there was one, the above saved it).
If the feature is explicitly enabled or disabled, then the config value will be set regardless of when `atom.config.get` is called.
If the user has manually shown any provider they have probably forgotten they are in distraction-free mode, and intend to enter it.
If we are currently composing (IME) and using a fallback to do so, try to extract the composed characters from the fallback object.
If we did traverse, this fragment reference would lead us to create an object with a __dataID__ instead of the desired `undefined`.
In case you want to use the Rotten Tomatoes' API on a real app you should create an account at http://developer.rottentomatoes.com/
Includes additional information that is useful to the UI, but redundant or nonsensical for providers to include in their responses.
It exports the FS on http via the endpoint: http://your.server:your_port/fs/method where method is one of readFile, writeFile, etc.
It's best to store the information in this method and then take any action at a later point (either in `keyboardDidShow` or other).
Measurement can be split in two steps, the set-up work that applies to the whole line, and the measurement of the actual character.
Need to subtract 2: one to move from 1-indexed to 0-indexed, another to account for the open paren we had to add on the first line.
Normally, SELECT elements and their OPTIONs can only take value of type 'string' (because the values are stored on DOM attributes).
Note that this is somewhat dangerous b/c it calls setState() again, effectively mutating the component before all the work is done.
Now double-hash to avoid leaking timing information - there's no easy constant-time compare in JS, so we use this approach instead.
Only mixin to components which have simple props and state, or use `forceUpdate()` when you know deep data structures have changed.
Represent the known event types in a compact way, then at runtime transform it into a hash with event name as key (for fast lookup)
Right now our internals discard the information about the relationship between the queries that is encoded in the nested structure.
Since these tests are triggered inside the end event of the above topic, transitions will inherit ids from the original transition.
So whenever we want to set a reactive property without forcing conversion on the new value, we wrap that call inside this function.
That means that for the web, `pageXOffset/pageYOffset` should be added to to getBoundingClientRect to make consistent with touches.
The ConnectionMultiplexer will close only if there are no connections and if either the attach or launch DbgpConnectors are closed.
The actual message transformations are tested in the tests from linterMessageToDiagnosticMessage -- no need to duplicate them here.
The algorithm used to determine whether a regexp can appear at a given point in the program is loosely based on sweet.js' approach.
The following post provides a lot of thoughts into how to build this loop: http://gafferongames.com/game-physics/fix-your-timestep/
The other important side effects are the highlight abstract method invocations (internal callbacks) to be implemented by the mixer.
This data structure is designed to hold the top K scores from a collection of N scores where scores become available one at a time.
This has the advantage that Git will take care of using stored credentials and any additional negotiation that needs to take place.
This is an implementation of binary search which will always try and return the next lowest value checked if there is no exact hit.
This is used by a bazillion of npm modules we don't control so we don't have other choice than defining it as an env variable here.
Traverses the ID hierarchy and invokes the supplied `cb` on any IDs that should would receive a `mouseEnter` or `mouseLeave` event.
Use this as an opportunity to operate on the DOM when the component has been mounted (initialized and rendered) for the first time.
Used to only resize the line number gutter when necessary (when the amount of lines crosses a boundary that makes its width change)
Utilities used by GraphQLStore for storing ranges  GraphQLStore stores all of the parts of a range in a single GraphQLRange object.
Verify the expected results were returned by delegating to the HackService, and that local file paths are converted to NuclideUris.
We don't need to dispose of the menuItemDescriptions when the provider is disabled - it needs to be handled by the provider itself.
We don't want to enqueue any updates if any cells are in the middle of an incremental render, because it would just be wasted work.
We have already missed the change events from the disconnect time, watchman could have died, so the last clock result is not valid.
We store the original promise that we use to retrieve the last suggestion so callers can also await it to know when it's available.
We support ES6 inheriting from React.Component, the module pattern, and stateless components, but not ES6 classes that don't extend
What we can do to mitigate use getters and setters in development to disallow and issue a warning for changing the `size` property.
When the operation throws, the transaction should throw, but all of the error-free closers should execute gracefully without issue.
When true, the scroll view bounces horizontally when it reaches the end even if the content is smaller than the scroll view itself.
You may want to call this when you know that some deeper aspect of the component's state has changed but `setState` was not called.
`node`s within a connection are a special case as the ID used here must match the one generated prior to storing the parent `edge`.
and an array of objects is returned, each with the following properties:  - line: The line number in the generated source, or null.
http://blog.evanyou.me/2014/01/03/composition-event/ skip this for Android because it handles composition events quite differently.
in dev environment, we reread the manifest on every call this means we do not need to restart server on every change to client code
in some rare cases (e.g. working with nerf darts), there are segmented "private" (underscore-prefixed) config names -- don't export
not an actual buffer we keep track of, but a measurement of how much we're waiting to get pushed to some underlying socket or file.
should already be established as a File type XXX Todo: preserve hardlinks by tracking dev+inode+nlink, with a HardLinkReader class.
suffix exists, make sure someone didn't purposely put the suffix there by checking against the actual text associated with the node
the point at which it stops calling _read() to fill the buffer Note: 0 is a valid value, means "don't call _read preemptively ever"
there are many cases where the instance must become a fragment instance: basically anything that can create more than 1 root nodes.
- Other format characters (general category code Cf in the Unicode database) and ZERO WIDTH SPACE (U+200B) have a column width of 0.
@deprecated  Used temporarily by GraphQLStore, but all updates to this object are now handled through a `RelayRecordStore` instance.
@return An Observable with the following implementations: onNext: Calls the Observer with successive strings from stdout and stderr.
@returns A record containing the name of the method, and a FunctionType object encoding the arguments and return type of the method.
Also, an important relationship between these methods must be upheld: if two values are equal, they *must* return the same hashCode.
Augments `CopyConstructor` to be a poolable class, augmenting only the class itself (statically) not adding any prototypical fields.
Both the iframe and the host element for the React component are children of the root element that serves as the item for the panel.
Copied from lib/utils/git, because we need to use it before calling npm.load and lib/utils/git uses npm.js which doesn't allow that.
Explanation of some of the non-obvious fields:  - moveX/moveY: If no move event has been observed, then `(moveX, moveY)` is invalid.
For example, a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.
If nextProp is not a function, then don't bother changing prevProp since nextProp will win and go into the updatePayload regardless.
If path is null, empty or undefined, then return the connection which matches the hostname and ignore the initial working directory.
If the parent and child instances have a common owner ancestor, start with that -- otherwise we just start with the parent's owners.
If we have pending requests and a socket gets closed a new one needs to be created to take over in the pool for the one that closed.
Intentionally fetch the filesystem contents after getting the committed contents to make sure we have the latest filesystem version.
It's unclear why the 1-based to 0-based indexing works the way that it does, but this has the desired effect in the UI, in practice.
Mark as new so that a conflict for this target always require a choice Also allows for the target to be converted in case of being *
Note: The scheduler for promises (`Promise.resolve().then`) runs on the same queue as `process.nextTick` but with a higher priority.
Pass a mocked component module to this method to augment it with useful methods that allow it to be used as a dummy React component.
Prevent binding on the dynamically-injected text node (as developers are unlikely to expect that, and it has security implications).
Returns `true` if `node` is considered "empty", which means that it contains no non-generated fields, and no ref query dependencies.
Since providers can be slow, the pane-change and edit events are emitted immediately in case the UI needs to clear outdated results.
So we suppress finish from being emitted here, and only emit it after our target stream is closed and we've moved everything around.
Suppose an event handler in each root enqueues an update to the childControl element -- the two updates should get batched together.
TODO: make this configurable somehow, we probably don't want to explicitly list out all of the lowercase html tags that are built-in
Tell the controller to re-render only if it exists so test runner services won't force construction if the panel is still invisible.
The `event.nativeEvent` object passed to this callback will have following fields: - position - index of page that has been selected
The first element in info will be for the declaration itself, the second will be for its direct semantic parent (if it exists), etc.
The lstat endpoint is the same as the stat endpoint except it will return the stat of a link instead of the file the link points to.
There are three productions that can be parsed in a parentheses pair that needs to be determined after the outermost pair is closed.
This diverges from the typical responder callback pattern (without using `PanResponder`), but avoids more dispatches than necessary.
This is necessary because handling an `edges` field also requires information about the parent connection field (see `_writeEdges`).
This is pulled out into its own function rather than using localeCompare directly in case we every choose another sorting algorithm.
This means we need to wrap the appropriate functions so they do not include the extra information added by Chromium's chatty logger.

We may receive an `observedTopOfStack` without ever requesting it - native can instigate pops of its own with the backswipe gesture.
We wrap `fn` instead of passing it directly to `.forEach` so it only gets called with one arg (i.e. it matches the Flow annotation).
When including a file with a negated rule, it's relevant if a directory partially matches, since it may then match a file within it.
attrs on the component template root node, if replace:true (child scope)  If this is a fragment instance, we only need to compile 1.
based on transition type: - transition or animation: wait for end event, remove class, then done if there's no explicit js callback.
if sub-queries are split then this *entire* field will be tracked, therefore we don't need to merge the `trackedNode` from each item
ignore files beginning with a dot, but not files in a parent or ancestor directory (which in relative format will begin with `../`).
(Modern browsers have events that indicate IME taking place, but these are not widely supported or compatible enough yet to rely on.)
(The Firstname Lastname may not appear sometimes.) If `useShortName` is true, then the author portion will contain only the username.
2) Other module's customization to Error.prepareStackTrace, no matter before or after the hook is added, will still work as expected.
@param returnType - The type of object that this function returns, so the the transport layer can register the appropriate listeners.
All state for the file tree will be kept in FileTreeStore and the only way to update the store is through methods on FileTreeActions.

Given a DOM node, return the ReactDOMComponent or ReactDOMTextComponent instance, or null if the node was not rendered by this React.
If _read pushed data synchronously, then `reading` will be false, and we need to re-evaluate how much data we can return to the user.
If change and propertychange bubbled, we'd just bind to it like all the other events and have it go through ReactBrowserEventEmitter.
If passed an array of button configurations, each button should include a `text` key, as well as optional `onPress` and `style` keys.
If the data, order, and number of resolved records has not changed since the last call to `resolve`, the same array will be returned.
If the remote-projects package hasn't loaded yet remote directories will be instantiated as local directories but with invalid paths.
If we made it all the way through the loop, provider must be lower priority than all of the existing providers, so add it to the end.
If we're updating to null or undefined, we should remove the property from the DOM node instead of inadvertantly setting to a string.
If we're updating to null or undefined, we should remove the property from the DOM node instead of inadvertently setting to a string.
In modern browsers (i.e., not IE8 or IE9), the input event is exactly what we want so fall through here and trigger an abstract event
In order to avoid exponential backtracking, we use two flags to denote if the production can be binding element or assignment target.
Items with lower priority values appear earlier in the context menu (i.e., items appear in numerical order with respect to priority).
Keep track of the provided types, union the types if they already exist, which allows for prototype subclasses to provide more types.
Makes sure a certain child node is present in the file tree, creating all its ancestors, if needed and scheduling a chilld key fetch.
Most of the methods defined on the Doc type are also injected into CodeMirror.prototype, for backwards compatibility and convenience.
Next we need to exclude the closing ` from the .loc of the last quasi element, in case the parser accidentally decided to include it.
Nullify .loc information for the child declaration so that we never try to reprint it without also reprinting the export declaration.
Once the user has interacted with distraction-free mode it would be weird if another package loading triggered a change in the state.
Record is known not to exist (either as the result of a mutation, or because the server returned `null` when queried for the record).
Replace every Unicode escape sequence with the equivalent BMP character or a constant ASCII code point in the case of astral symbols.
Reset the current text selection only if the click is done outside of the selection and 'resetSelectionOnContextMenu' option is true.
Save version/tag/commit in the release Note that we can't store branches because _release is supposed to be an unique id of this ref.
TODO: Now that all calls to _data and _removeData have been replaced with direct calls to data_priv methods, these can be deprecated.
The pass through stream is from readable-stream and is thus a current streams3 implementation that is free of these bugs even on 0.8.
The projections must have mutually exclusive clip regions on the sphere, as this will avoid emitting interleaving lines and polygons.
These are packages we want to activate, including some which come bundled with atom, or ones widely used in conjunction with nuclide.
These properties are a subset of our styles that are consumed by the layout algorithm and affect the positioning and sizing of views.
This allows having multiple StatusBar components and the one that is added last or is deeper in the view hierachy will have priority.
This fetches the 'default' connection configuration supplied to the user regardless of any connection profiles they might have saved.
This function generates the definitions if the they don't exist, and caches the proxy module if it has already been generated before.
This module calls into get-uid-gid.js, which sets the uid and gid to the supplied argument, in order to find out their numeric value.
This only works in a few limited cases (where there is no function return value, and the function operates mutatively on parameters).
This probably breaks for non-sibling dirs, but that is not a problem as buildconf only checks for pecl as either a child or a sibling
This utility unwraps contiguous leading and trailing markers from lines and then inserts pre and post before adding the markers back.
Using plain for loops here because this will be called in the getter of any watcher with filters so it is very performance sensitive.
Version of ServerConnectionConfiguration that uses string instead of Buffer for fields so it can be translated directly to/from JSON.
We create an overlay to always display the resize cursor while the user is resizing the panel, even if their mouse leaves the handle.
We do this during transclusion instead at compile time so that the distribution is decoupled from the compilation order of the slots.
We know that we're about to delete this one, and also what the next least recently used key will be, so just go ahead and set it now.
We should never depend on the order of registration of the `onDidChangePaths` event, which also dispose consumed service's resources.
When used to scope for completion on a *sub-command* (e.g. for "git log" on a "git" tool), then it would have a value (e.g. "__log").
Without this first invariant, passing a non-DOM-component triggers the next invariant for a missing parent, which is super confusing.
if we got an error we'll try to put back the original module back, succeed or fail though we want the original error that caused this
the actual outgoing request is not started until start() is called this function is called from both the constructor and on redirect.

However, if we ever elect to use timers in Safari, the prevalent work-around is to add a scroll event listener that calls for a flush.
IE8 fails to fire propertychange on the first input event after setting `value` from a script and fires only keydown, keypress, keyup.
If the editor of the new location matches the current location, then the current location is updated, otherwise a new entry is pushed.
If we are ignoring linter errors, replace the input with empty string if it doesn't already at least start or end a multi-line comment
In order to qualify as leading, a comment must be separated from fn by an unbroken series of whitespace-only gaps (or other comments).
In practice, `rangeInfo` is `undefined` if unfetched, `null` if the connection was deleted (in which case `connectionID` is null too).

Insets define the minimum margin for these components and can be used to effectively align Toolbar content along well-known gridlines.
Inspired by require("ast-types").NodePath.prototype.needsParens, but more efficient because we're iterating backwards through a stack.
Jest does not allow running only one tick, so just assert that broadcasts occurring twice means `mockCallback` was invoked separately.
Keep in sync with the clang Python binding (../fb/lib/python/clang/cindex.py) The order of the keys matches the ordering in cindex.py.

Shrink crumbs one at a time by applying the shrinkingFunction until the crumbs fit in the container or we run out of crumbs to shrink.
Simple flat clone using prototype, accepts only objects, usefull for property override on FLAT configuration object (no nested props).
The order of iteration should follow the order of assignment, which happens to match numerical index order, but we don't rely on that.
This is an implementation of binary search which will always try and return the index of the closest element if there is no exact hit.
This test ensures that the broad matching is not done when the matched module is not a direct child of the module doing the requiring.
We can only do something meaningful for elements and comment nodes (in particular, not text nodes, as IE can't store domdata for them)
We don't want to be precise, but rather pick something least affected by animationtransforms, so that we don't change scale too often.
We expect what plugins doesn't have equal methods, events or types, otherwise we throw an error, because this is unsolvable situation.
We need to collect RegExp flags and append they to description, or open issue in NodeJS same as 'RegExp text serialized without flags'
an overlay marker at a buffer range with row x renders under row x + 1 so, use range at bufferRow - 1 to actually display at bufferRow

For style(name, string) or style(name, string, priority), set the style property with the specified name, using the specified priority.
GraphQLRange nodes can also support static queries like surrounds, find, whose contents won't ever change for a given set of arguments.
If it's not, then it's likely a mistake so we'll warn you to use the static property, property initializer or constructor respectively.

In response, Atom will create a generic Directory for this URI, and add it to the list of root project paths (atom.project.getPaths()).
Internally, all KO objects are attached to koExports (even the non-exported ones whose names will be minified by the closure compiler).
It's fine the user connected to a different project on the same host: we should still be able to restore this using the new connection.
Note that the state variable would need to be updated as the user selects a value and changes the index, as shown in the example below.
Note: files loaded via invokeRemoteMethod() use a variety of ES6/7+ features to verify that Babel transpilation is working as intended.

The flush function processes all tasks that have been scheduled with `rawAsap` unless and until one of those tasks throws an exception.
The require parameter is needed because require is bound differently in each file, and we need to execute this in the caller's context.
This may have side effects, but any external subscriptions or data created by this method must be cleaned up in `componentWillUnmount`.
This re-assigns the method in order to preserve function names in stack traces (which are detected by modern debuggers via heuristics).
To change the animation or gesture properties of the scene, provide a `configureScene` prop to get the config object for a given route.
Two elements created in two different places should be considered equal for testing purposes and therefore we hide it from enumeration.

Get a regular expression object for this pattern-flag pair, or `null` in case the current environment doesn't support the flags it uses.
Handles the payload for a range edge deletion, which removes the edge from a specified range but does not delete the node for that edge.
However, because --keep-going was specified, the build report should have still been written unless any of the target args were invalid.
If a component renders to null or if another component fatals and causes the state of the tree to be corrupted, `node` here can be null.
If the user's input matches this string (meaning the user hasn't changed it), the user's input will not be saved as part of the profile.
If this ever fires, either ensure that your test closes all RemoteConnections or we can add a force shutdown method to ServerConnection.
If you call the DOM-manipulating functions on ko.virtualElements, you will be able to read and write the state of that virtual hierarchy
In that case, we don't want to throw if we can't find the source - we just want to return null, so we provide a flag to exit gracefully.
Lines with gutter elements, widgets or a background class need to be wrapped again, and have the extra elements added to the wrapper div
Mobile Safari does not fire properly bubble click events on non-interactive elements, which means delegated click listeners do not fire.
No other item will be selected if there aren't any other profiles, so make sure that view gets cleared when the last profile is removed.
Not doing this results in an "Runtime.getProperties failed" error in node-inspector since that call is only valid during a paused state.
Note that `require('module')._resolveFilename(path, module)` is equivelent to `require.resolve(path)` under the context of given module.
Note: getLengthSync DOESN'T calculate streams length As workaround one can calculate file size manually and add it as knownLength option
Once attached, the observer converts target object's property keys into getter/setters that collect dependencies and dispatches updates.
Plugins can override original methods, events or types, so we don't need to throw error on conflict, we only print a warning to console.
Probably in the "in body" parsing mode, so we outlaw only tag combos where the parsing rules cause implicit opens or closes to be added.
Results may be `null` if the data was marked as deleted or `undefined` if the fragment was either not fetched or evicted from the cache.
See: https://our.intern.facebook.com/intern/dex/nuclide/writing-an-integration-test/ for instructions on how to write integration tests.

The default location of assets bundled with the app, located by resource identifier The Android resource system picks the correct scale.
The enter-key is technically both printable and non-printable and can thus be captured by `keypress`, no other non-printable key should.
There is unfortunately no standard format to report an error, so we have to write a specific converter for each tool we want to support.
This helper class stores information about text content of a target node, allowing comparison of content before and after a given event.
This way, another package could require nuclide-logging during activation without worrying about introducing a significant startup cost.
Though once we start supporting ordinary .cpp files, then we likely need to be even more careful about choosing the architecture flavor.
Use a fake platform so the platform's PATH is not used in case the test is run on a platform that requires special handling (like OS X).
Use this inside `PanelComponent` rather than just file-tree so any scrollable panels created with this component are styled accordingly.
We know that it's not enough to fill up a whole block, because otherwise it would have been emitted above, but there may be some offset.

diffProperties takes two sets of props and a set of valid attributes and write to updatePayload the values that changed or were deleted.
fnparam means that this identifier is being defined as a function argument prop means that this identifier is that of an object property
forRect is used by rectangular selections, and tries to estimate a character position even for coordinates beyond the right of the text.
if we have a canonical ID for the module imported here, we use it, so that require() is always called with the same id for every module.
if we inspect a stateless component we can't use the getPublicInstance method therefore we use the internal _instance property directly.
isValid's strategy (with containsNode) does not work because render trees may be nested and we don't want a false positive in that case.
request will not pay attention to the NOPROXY environment variable if a config value named proxy is passed in, even if it's set to null.
text: this._request.content // TODO: pull out into a boolean flag, as content can be huge (and needs to be requested with an async call)
- A primitive DOM component - which has many renderedChildren, each of which may have a name that is unique with respect to its siblings.

Android doesn't trigger composition events for language input methods e.g. Chinese, but instead triggers them for spelling suggestions...
Atom is smart about only displaying a separator when there are items to separate, so there will never be a dangling separator at the end.
Attach a DOM node disposal callback so that the computed will be proactively disposed as soon as the node is removed using ko.removeNode.
BuckToolbarActions and BuckToolbarStore implement an older version of the Flux pattern which puts a lot of the async work into the store.
But we increment the length without the trimming since the next time we view the length any trailing whitespace will have been important.
Check if there's a resolution that resolves the conflict Note that if one of them is marked as unresolvable, the resolution has no effect
During execution of guarded functions we will capture the first error which we will rethrow to be handled by the top level error handler.
Each array corresponds to a supplied render method and contains the instances returned by that render method in the order it was invoked.
Extension: Overrides `grammarScopes` and triggers the linter on changes to any file, rather than just files with specific grammar scopes.
For horizontal scroll views, a distance of 30 from the left of the screen is the standard maximum position to start touch responsiveness.
Force original file even if user hasn't changed comments since they may have nagivated away from it within the iframe without us knowing.
However, the watchman update for the files that have changed due to the Mercurial action may arrive before the update for the wlock file.
IE does not dispose attachEvent handlers automatically (unlike with addEventListener) so to avoid leaks, we have to remove them manually.
If a task throws an exception, `flush` ensures that its state will remain consistent and will resume where it left off when called again.
If containersByReactRootID contains the container we find by crawling up the tree, we know that this instance of React rendered the node.
If we are not in a transition from this index, make sure opacity is 0 to prevent the enabled scene from flashing over the presented scene
If we were to continue synchronously here, the debugger would no longer be paused when the remaining subscribers' callbacks were invoked.
In case a subscription was disposed during the arrayForEach cycle, check for isDisposed on each subscription before invoking its callback
It can be a subset if certain fields are impossible to create on the client (and if views are expected to handle the data inconsistency).
It should be noted that our approach makes it super simple to manage your gadget state using React (`setState()`) but doesn't require it.
Lowercase jquery is used because AMD module names are derived from file names, and jQuery is normally delivered in a lowercase file name.
Mutations with the same collision are sent to the server serially and in-order to avoid unpredictable and potentially incorrect behavior.
Note that safeSpawn() often overrides options.env.PATH, but that only happens when options.env is undefined (which is not the case here).
Note that the list returned by this function is a copy of the internal supertypeList, *without* the typeName itself as the first element.
Now we unmount the component, as if caused by a non-React event handler for the same click we're about to simulate, like closing a layer:
Option overwriting strategies are functions that handle how to merge a parent option value and a child option value into the final value.
Since the regex in "getVersion" is not strict semver (so that it can be read in python) this test enforces that it is truly semver valid.
Since we augment the global scope using configuration, we need to update references and remove the ones that were added by configuration.
That may lead to a sequence calls: lockFileChange(false) then lockFileChange(true), stopping future events from being sent to the client.
The "composite hash" is similar to the concrete instance hash, but it also differentiates between varying variable values or route names.
The ids are generated on the client API side and must be unique, so the check below shouldn't be hit unless someone is bypassing the API.
The math is pretty obscure, but this cool website has nice visual illustrations of what they represent: http://xaedes.de/dev/transitions/
The rendered element will be initialized with an empty value, the prop `defaultValue` if specified, or the children content (deprecated).
This contrasts with JSMs which are singletons, Domains allows us to optionally load a CommonJS module twice with separate data each time.
This directly kills the servers without removing the RemoteConnections so that restarting Nuclide preserves the existing workspace state.
This does influence the API, so keep that in mind when it seems a little trickier to do something compared to a fully synchronous system.
This file contains a set of custom matchers for jasmine testing, which can be used to get more detailed / useful diffs on various reults.
This is to maintain compatibility with W3C touch "end" events, where the active touches don't include the set that has just been "ended".
This logic can technically be fooled if the node has parentheses but there are comments intervening between the parentheses and the node.
This object exists in other packages outside of any model, so objects vended early must still always manipulate the latest model's state.
This should not be named `constructor` since this may not be the function that created the element, and it may not even be a constructor.
This will be un-marked in unmarkExtraneous, where we mark as not-extraneous everything that is required in some way from the root object.
Unfortunately, `onScrollBeginDrag` also fires when *stopping* the scroll animation, and there's not an easy way to distinguish a drag vs.
Update scale, tolerating zero or NaN from tween.cur() And breaking the loop if scale is unchanged or perfect, or if we've just had enough
Use the fastest means possible to execute a task in its own turn, with priority over other events including network IO events in Node.js.
We may want to figure out which other paths we want to invalidate if it turns out that linters regularly return messages for other files.
When a key in this map is used in a way that would cause it to be required, the value is the module that is required rather than the key.
Without the `TouchableWithoutFeedback`, taps on this inspector pane would change the inspected element to whatever is under the inspector

You can tell JSHint that you don't use break intentionally by adding a comment /* falls through */ on a line just before the next `case`.
`enqueue` takes a Task object with either a simple `run` callback, or a `gen` function that returns a `Promise` and puts it in the queue.
cover - The image will be resized such that the entire area of the view is covered by the image, potentially clipping parts of the image.
insert() is O(lg K) getTopScores() is O(K lg K)  Therefore, finding the top K scores from a collection of N elements should be O(N lg K).
one-shot build optimizes build by asking compiler to build several objects at once, reducing overhead of starting new compiler processes.
- Ensure that `onResponderTerminate` is called on touch cancels, whether or not `onResponderTerminationRequest` returns `true` or `false`.

A series of a non-extending char + any number of extending chars is treated as a single unit as far as editing and measuring is concerned.
An ancestor walk builds up an array of ancestor nodes (including the current node) and passes them to the callback as the state parameter.
Because Node uses an event-loop, we do not have to worry about a call to write() coming in from another thread between our two calls here.
Because behavior goes wacky when you set `__proto__` on objects, we have to prefix all the strings in our set with an arbitrary character.
By default, this can scroll with negative offset, pulling the content down so that the target component's bottom meets the keyboard's top.
CAUTION: This is an experimental component and should only be used together with javascript implementation of list view (see ListView.js).

Each render method is invoked with the classes created using the render methods that come after it in the supplied list of render methods.
Extra arguments are stored as the mode's dependencies, which is used by (legacy) mechanisms like loadmode.js to automatically load a mode.
Flag that indicates whether we currently expect input to appear (after some event like 'keypress' or 'input') and are polling intensively.
Flow naively thinks that since we are in a closure, fileToMessages could have been reassigned to something null by the time this executes.
Get the binding from the provider within a computed observable so that we can update the bindings whenever the binding context is updated.
Given a ReactCompositeComponent instance, return a list of its recursive owners, starting at the root and ending with the instance itself.
However, we cannot just call `get` and then check it against null because T may be a nullable type, in which case this would break subtly.
If `value` is not supplied (or null/undefined), user actions that change the selected option will trigger updates to the rendered options.
If the last suggestion had multiple ranges, we have no choice but to fetch suggestions because the new word might be between those ranges.
If we put this type on the definition, use sites will not see the individual properties in the Server object for things like autocomplete.
In case several nodes were selected, the topmost (first in the natural visual order) is considered to be the reference point for the move.
In practice, we query for a subset of those fields because we intersect the fat query with the tracked query we have for a given node (ie.
In turn, `TouchableMixin` expects us to implement some abstract methods to handle interesting interactions such as `handleTouchablePress`.
It is somewhat obscure, because it works in character codes rather than characters, and because operator parsing has been inlined into it.
Line separator U+2028 and Paragraph Separator U+2029 are the potential issues here, as they can show up in JSON but must be escaped in JS.
Once again, Sass deviates from the spec and supplies the version as a string rather than a number, so we use loose equality checking here.
Previously, if you had a dep in your shrinkwrap then anything that required that dependency would count as a match, regardless of version.
Reads the file contents and returns empty string if the file doesn't exist which means it was removed in the HEAD dirty repository status.
Save the generic parts of all stack traces so we can avoid hardcoding Node-specific implementation details in our testing of stack traces.
Some of the pretty-printer code (such as that for printing function parameter lists) makes a valiant attempt to prevent really long lines.
Some users were relying on this funky behavior, so after removing the aggressive normalization from non-hosted URIs, we brought this back.
The Def object d returned from Type.def may be used to configure the type d.type by calling methods such as d.bases, d.build, and d.field.
The context stack is used to superficially track syntactic context to predict whether a regular expression is allowed in a given position.
The prevInput test prevents this from firing when a context menu is closed (since the resetInput would kill the select-all detection hack)
The shasum's already been checked, but we haven't ever had a peek inside, so we unpack it here just to make sure it is what it says it is.
This allows simple future calls of the service by name and arguments or http-triggered endpoint calls with arguments serialized over http.
This component is used to wrap strings between comment nodes so that they can undergo the same reconciliation that is applied to elements.
This returns true if the highWaterMark has not been hit yet, similar to how Writable.write() returns true if you should write() some more.
Walk through the file-system "database" of installed packages, and create a data object related to the installed versions of each package.
We accumulate these as we go, so we can be sure to trigger them after the whole `Program` entity is parsed, even for top-of-file comments.
We are making a copy of the buffered messages list, so that the messages are sent event when pauseEvents() is called before the next tick.
We can't wrap only `onSocket` for handling all requests, there is one case, when `onSocket` will be never called (Agent + no free sockets)
We should show a better message but properly doing so probably requires refactoring how we load the panel and communicate with the bridge.
When `compareCommitId` is null, the `HEAD` commit contents is compared to the filesystem, otherwise it compares that commit to filesystem.
When there is no exact match, BasicSourceMapConsumer.prototype._findMapping returns the index of the closest mapping less than the needle.
While `isCollapsed` is available on the Selection object and `collapsed` is available on the Range object, IE11 sometimes gets them wrong.
XXX This should be more like how -C works, so you can explicitly set a root dir, and also explicitly set a pathname in the tarball to use.
https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.0.8  Note on periods: Using the extension "cats" will match the files "file.cats" and "cats".
if we haven't asked to stat everything, then just assume that everything in there exists, so we can avoid having to stat it a second time.
@internal  Traverses a query and data in the record store to determine if there are additional nodes that needs to be read from disk cache.
Adding this assertion here ensures that all of the values are valid ServerStatus options, while yielding better Flow behavior at use sites.
Among cookies that have equal-length path fields, cookies with earlier creation-times are listed before cookies with later creation-times."
As of the introduction of atom.workspace.buildTextEditor(), it is no longer possible to subclass TextEditor to create a ReadOnlyTextEditor.
At this point the parent folder should be deleted To test against the in-memory cache, we create a folder manually and request the versions
Browsers without "deltaMode" is reporting in raw wheel delta where one notch on the scroll is always +/- 120, roughly equivalent to pixels.
By default, it will request all notification permissions, but a subset of these can be requested by passing a map of requested permissions.
Creates a new instance of a rule configuration set  A rule configuration set is an array of configurations that are valid for a given rule.
Finds the next node in the tree in the natural order - from top to to bottom as is displayed in the file-tree panel, minus the indentation.
For example, if the URL is "https://www.facebook.com", the system browser will be opened, or the "choose application" dialog will be shown.
Future: - Restore document/overflow scroll positions that were unintentionally modified via DOM insertions above the top viewport boundary.
Gets the connectionIDs for all variations of calls for the given base schema name (Ex: `posts.orderby(recent)` and `posts.orderby(likes)`).
However, the bound on the number of services is the number of remote connections initiated during this Nuclide session, plus the local one.
If HgStatusOption.ALL_STATUSES was passed and a file does not appear in the results, it must mean the file was removed from the filesystem.
If `props` is present but `done` is false, then sufficient data is ready to render, but some data dependencies have not yet been fulfilled.
If the click did not happen on the dialog or on any of its descendants, the click was elsewhere on the document and should close the modal.
If there is a declaration and the kind is 'type', the declaration must be a type alias of some sort which already includes the word 'type'.
Invoked when the item is long pressed - meaning the interaction ended by letting up while the item was in `RESPONDER_ACTIVE_LONG_PRESS_IN`.
Like Array.prototype.some, the final result is either true or false to indicates whether the callback returned true for any element or not.
Mark a component as needing a rerender, adding an optional callback to a list of functions which will be executed once the rerender occurs.
Note it should be possible to get the HTML via MarkdownPreviewView.getHTML(), but that was causing this script to lock up, for some reason.
Only the code that actually adds its `nodeHandle` (`tag`) as a child of a container can confidently record that in `ReactNativeTagHandles`.
Parse a semicolon-enclosed block of statements, handling `"use strict"` declarations when `allowStrict` is true (used for function bodies).
Push the node's children on the stack in reverse order so that when they are popped off the stack, they are iterated in the original order.
Return a regular expression object for this pattern-flag pair, or `null` in case the current environment doesn't support the flags it uses.
Since using `List` is really just the implementation detail, we don't want to accept `routeNodes` as `list` from constructor for developer.
Supports string shapes by extracting numbers so new values can be computed, and recombines those values into new strings of the same shape.
TODO: Instead of making gestures recompute filtered velocity, we could include a built in velocity computation that can be reused globally.
The Tab-key is considered non-printable and does not have a `charCode`, presumably because it does not produce a tab-character in browsers.
The front-end therefore needs to check for `consts.inspected` on received objects, and can thereby display object proxies and inspect them.
Therefore, if a file is included in the WorkingSet, then the file-tree must have a way to know that it must include its parent directories.
This catches EF BB BF (the UTF-8 BOM) because the buffer-to-string conversion in `fs.readFileSync()` translates it to FEFF, the UTF-16 BOM.
This class encapsulates all the state of the packager so as to keep the Activation class (which brings together various RN features) clean.
This helps to capture the propType error at run-time, where as `NavigationTypeDefinition` capture the flow type check errors at build time.
This is to (at least) handle the case where the user is moving three fingers, and then one of the fingers stops but the other two continue.
This method is invoked as part of initialize(), and so, it should be safe to invoke any of the getter methods on this class in this method.
This pipes all of our console logging functions to native logging so that JavaScript errors in required modules show up in Xcode via NSLog.
Unfortunately, there is no way to register for resize events on a DOM element: it is only possible to listen for resize events on a window.
We did not find the exact element, and there is no next-closest element which is less than the one we are searching for, so we return null.
We use `stopTogether: false` here because otherwise tracking will break because the second animation will get stopped before it can update.
WebKit Bug 13343 - getComputedStyle returns wrong value for margin-right Work around by temporarily setting element display to inline-block
What we're going to want to do is basically create the unsigned equivalent of our representation and pass that off to the wuint* functions.
`touchHistory` isn't actually on the native event, but putting it in the interface will ensure that it is cleaned up when pooled/destroyed.
default: This is a nested attribute configuration where all the properties were removed so we need to go through and clear out all of them.
over and underflow not realistically a concern: V8's getTime() seems to store something larger than a 32-bit time_t (even with 32-bit node)
this.props.onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed  Standard Keyboard Hide Sequence:  this.props.onKeyboardWillHide this.props.onKeyboardDidHide
An object containing properties and methods that should be defined on the component's constructor instead of its prototype (static methods).
Any partial character found at the end of the buffer is buffered up, and will be returned when calling write again with the remaining bytes.
Calling atom.project.repositoryForDirectory gets the real path of the directory, which requires a round-trip to the server for remote paths.
Checks if a provided path is a directory and returns a glob string matching all files under that directory if so, the path itself otherwise.

Empirically, doing an initial search speeds up the next search much more than simply doing the setup kicked off by 'fileSearchForDirectory'.
Ensure it's a real array, as we're about to reparent the nodes and we don't want the underlying collection to change while we're doing that.
However, if a TextEditor is created via some other means, (such as a building block for a piece of UI), then it must be observed explicitly.
If "Reveal File on Switch" is enabled, ensure the scroll position is synced to where the user expects when the side bar shows the file tree.
If any field in `patternNode` is unterminated (i.e. has no sub-fields), we treat the field as though it contains every descendant sub-field.
If encountered, nodes of these types should be either left alone or desugared into AST types that are fully supported by the pretty-printer.
If isFunction.check(from), and from is not a built-in constructor, assume from is a binary predicate function we can use to define the type.
If resolution is a commit, we need to clone the entire repo and check it out Because a commit is not a named ref, there's no better solution
If the connection isn't present (because it wasn't in the fat query or because it didn't survive query intersection), validation is skipped.
If the response content is being decoded, the Content-Encoding header of the response doesn't represent the piped content, so don't pass it.
If this is a strict mode function, verify that argument names are not repeated, and it does not try to bind the words `eval` or `arguments`.
In order to return the same Def instance every time Type.def is called with a particular name, those instances need to be stored in a cache.
In other browsers, doing so is slower or neutral compared to the other order (in Firefox, twice as slow) so we only do this inversion in IE.
It's prefer that mixins determine state in this way, having the class explicitly mix the state in the one and only `getInitialState` method.
Normally we'd insert a comment node, but since this is a situation where React won't take over (static pages), we can simply return nothing.
Note that if x is not monotonic, it's possible that the slope will be infinite, so we protect against NaN by setting the coordinate to zero.
Note: because of this extension, the key equality of Immutable.Map and the value equality of Immutable.Set will differ from ES6 Map and Set.
On press down, the opacity of the wrapped view is decreased, which allows the underlay color to show through, darkening or tinting the view.
Only after 1.7.10 --branch accepts tags Detect those cases and inform the user to update git otherwise it's a lot slower than newer versions
Partially apply a function by creating a version that has had some of its arguments pre-filled, without changing its dynamic `this` context.
Plus, for many of the individual attributes in S5.3 it says to use the "attribute-value of the last attribute in the cookie-attribute-list".
Rather than crash on mismatched plurality of fragment/ids just warn and resolve as if the fragment's pluarity matched the format of the ids.
Return true if the next token matches the specified contextual keyword (where an identifier is sometimes a keyword depending on the context)
Returns a Promise with photo identifier objects from the local camera roll of the device matching shape defined by `getPhotosReturnChecker`.
Returns a list of client mutation IDs for queued mutations whose optimistic updates are affecting the record corresponding the given dataID.
Save current transaction state -- if the return value from this method is passed to `rollback`, the transaction will be reset to that state.
Since JS doesn't have multiple prototypal inheritance, this class prototypally inherits from Readable, and then parasitically from Writable.
So, in order to not ask hyperclick for the same thing again and again which will be anyway null, we check if the mouse position has changed.
TODO (balpert): Wrap iOS native components in a composite wrapper, then ReactInstanceMap.get here will always succeed for mounted components
TODO(mbolin): Buck does have an option where the user can customize the name of the build file: https://github.com/facebook/buck/issues/238.
TODO: This will be deprecated because state should always keep a consistent type signature and the only use case for this, is to avoid that.
That could contain a resolution postfix, we need to find that image (or the closest one to it's resolution) in one of the project roots:  1.
The BMP character to use as a replacement for astral symbols when translating an ES6 "u"-flagged pattern to an ES5-compatible approximation.
The Darwin patch below results in callbacks first for the write and then for the error handler, so make sure we only call our callback once.
The client seems to want a copy of this Lines object, but Lines objects are immutable, so it's perfectly adequate to return the same object.
The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.
The following functions define the column width of an ISO 10646 character as follows: - The null character (U+0000) has a column width of 0.
The primary purpose of this method is to "tap into" a method chain, in order to perform operations on intermediate results within the chain.
Therefore the parent property is never given to the node's constructor, but rather set by the parent itself when the node is assigned to it.
This is similar to Atom's `Pane::findOrCreateXmostSibling` methods, but these positions are absolute (i.e. don't depend on the active pane).
This means that any state that affects the height, such as tap to expand, should be stored outside the row component to maintain continuity.
This must be a valid UTF-8 string, and will be sent exactly as specified, with no additional encoding (e.g. URL-escaping or base64) applied.
To change this behavior this comparator return -1 in the case events startTime's are equal, so both events got placed into the result array.
We need to provide this childFactory so that ReactCSSTransitionGroupChild can receive updates to name, enter, and leave while it is leaving.
When constructed, RemoteDirectorySearcher must be passed a function that it can use to get a 'FindInProjectService' for a given remote path.
You don't really gain a lot from having a large number of commands spawned at once, so it isn't super important for this number to be large.
create an anchor and insert it synchronously, so that we can resolve the correct order without worrying about some elements not inserted yet
execute code only when the state's not being updated by switching tab this avoids re-displaying the error, which comes after a certain delay
fetch the data modify to remove the version in question If no versions remaining, then DELETE else, PUT the modified data delete the tarball
for expressions containing literal numbers and booleans, there's no need to setup a prop binding, so we can optimize them as a one-time set.
if they specified a common name for the package that contains the library, tag some useful defaults on to the end of the path to be searched
on Windows, A/V software can lock the directory, causing this to fail with an EACCES or EPERM if the directory contains newly created files.
similar to chmodr except it add permissions rather than overwriting them adapted from https://github.com/isaacs/chmodr/blob/master/chmodr.js
(We do this here so we can pull in new versions of node-inspector without having to worry about what modifications we've made to the source.)
- If a node becomes the responder, it should convey visual feedback immediately to indicate so, either by highlighting or moving accordingly.
Besides checking for the condition being in the loop, we want to check the function that this modifier is belonging to is called in the loop.
Comparing to log4js's console appender(https://fburl.com/69861669), you can expand and explore the object in console logged by this Appender.
Convert a warning term into a RegExp which will match a comment containing that whole word in the specified location ("start" or "anywhere").
Each request is sent with a unique ID that the server should send back to signal that the message has been written to the appropriate stream.
File paths are used as event names for the _fileChangeEmitter, so a second emitter is used for other events to prevent event name collisions.
For most uses this works great, but in some cases this may cause flickering - one common cause is preventing edits by keeping value the same.
I'm leaving it here since this behavior belongs to the old propTypes system yet is currently implemented in the core ReactCompositeComponent.
If _read called its callback synchronously, then `reading` will be false, and we need to re-evaluate how much data we can return to the user.
If there are still any unknown options, then we simply die, unless someone asked for help, in which case we give it to them, and then we die.
If we are only doing script debugging, then the dummy connection listener's port can also be used to listen for the script's xdebug requests.
In `return` (and `break`/`continue`), the keywords with optional arguments, we eagerly look for a semicolon or the possibility to insert one.
It is incorrect to continuously take all active *and* recently moved touches, find the centroid, and track how that result changes over time.
Mock `Date.now` to use the fake Jasmine clock so `advanceClock` can be called synchronously and call appropriate callbacks deterministically.
Otherwise: Let cookie-path be the attribute-value."  We'll represent the default-path as null since it depends on the context of the parsing.
Really we should create references to unique objects so when we insert a marker it's impossible that it has appeared elsewhere in the source.
Similarly to "child" contexts, provide a function here to make sure that the correct values are set when an observable view model is updated.
Support: Android 2.3 Check if div with explicit width and no margin-right incorrectly gets computed margin-right based on width of container.
Suppress StyleInvalidator StyleRecalcInvalidationTracking invalidations because they will be handled by StyleInvalidatorInvalidationTracking.
TODO: Looks like there is bug in Node fs.createReadStream it doesn't respect `end` options without `start` options Fix it when node fixes it.
TabView checks for the existence of this method and uses it if it is available: https://github.com/atom/tabs/blob/master/lib/tab-view.coffee.
The CreateConnectionProfileForm will do basic validation on the inputs: It checks that the fields are non-empty before calling this function.
The `this` value is used if it's the global object to avoid Greasemonkey's restricted `window` object, otherwise the `window` object is used.
The user deleted everything and never applied a new property value via Up/Down scrolling/live editing, so remove the tree element and update.
These tests are a part of the continues build and are executed by the devtools_sanity_unittest.cc as a part of the Interactive UI Test suite.
This is primarily useful for literal values like toType(null), but it has the additional advantage of allowing toType to be a total function.
This is required because Firefox fires `keypress` events for key commands (cut, copy, select-all, etc.) even though no character is inserted.
This will be set to an array of strings when copying, so that, when pasting, we know what kind of selections the copied text was made out of.
This won't be valid JSON, but since we are using a real JS parser we need to make sure that this sort of input doesn't do really weird stuff.
Unfortunately, `hg log -Tjson` is not Observable-friendly because it will not parse as JSON until all of the data has been printed to stdout.
We can ignore unchecked radio buttons, because some other radio button will be getting checked, and that one can take care of updating state.
We subscribe to its resize events and use that as a proxy for the panel being resized and update the width of the FixedDataTable accordingly.
When the image has rounded corners, specifying an overlayColor will cause the remaining space in the corners to be filled with a solid color.
Work around the jQuery "click events on checkboxes" issue described above by storing the original checked state before triggering the handler
`finishOp` simply skips the amount of characters it is given as second argument, and returns a token of the type given by its first argument.
certain elements can have dimension info if we invisibly show them however, it must have a current display style that would benefit from this
@TODO Handling all encodings inside a single object makes it very difficult to reason about this code, so it should be split up in the future.
@internal  Enqueues one or more callbacks that each represent a synchronous unit of work that can be scheduled to be executed at a later time.
@internal  `validateRelayReadQuery` is a `__DEV__`-only validator that checks that a query used to read data from `RelayStore` is well-formed.
@return boolean Whether the file path exists within the working directory (aka root directory) of the repository, or is the working directory.
Because we will never consider this node or any nodes after it again, this node must be the closest following node we have encountered so far.
Create a higher-order component that automatically computes the `pointerEvents` property for a component whenever navigation position changes.
Define a type whose name is registered in a namespace (the defCache) so that future definitions will return the same type given the same name.
Deletes the record from the store, also removing any references to the node from any ranges that contain it (along with the containing edges).
Do the same thing, but for a remote project by starting the nuclide server using the remote-utils library in nuclide-integration-test-helpers.
Fetches a consistent object map from absolute file paths to their corresponding `StatusCodeNumber` for easy representation with the file tree.
Flag that indicates whether we expect input to appear real soon now (after some event like 'keypress' or 'input') and are polling intensively.
IE8 does not implement getModifierState so we simply map it to the only modifier keys exposed by the event itself, does not support Lock-keys.
If the child view model also depends on the parent view model, you must provide a function that returns the correct view model on each update.
If this lower-in-DOM node causes new content to be rendered at a place higher-in-DOM, we need to be careful not to invoke these new listeners.
In ReactDOM components, we make sure that single children that are strings are treated as "content" which is much faster to render and update.
NOTE: These type checking functions intentionally don't use `instanceof` because it is fragile and can be easily faked with `Object.create()`.
Note that `this._scrollComponent` might not be a `ScrollView`, so we need to check that it responds to `getScrollResponder` before calling it.
Note that none of these types are buildable because the Mozilla Parser API doesn't specify any builder functions, and nobody uses E4X anymore.
Note: document.documentElement.contains should work here but always returns false for comment nodes in phantomjs, making unit tests difficult.
Sadly, our setup fatals when doing multiple concurrent requests I don't have the time to dig into why, it's easier to just serialize requests.
TODO(mbolin): This does not account for the case where the user runs `buck build` from the command line while Nuclide is also trying to build.
Text nodes violate a couple assumptions that React makes about components:  - When mounting text into the DOM, adjacent text nodes are merged.
The following functions can run at two different times: The first is when the whole array is being updated directly from this binding handler.
The only way to do this properly would be to shell out to git-check-ref-format, and as this is a fast sync function, we don't want to do that.
The return value will not be consistent across nodes or browsers, but two identical selections on the same node will return identical objects.
Therefore, calls to `require('moduleId')` are not replaced with numeric IDs TODO(davidaurelio) Scan polyfills for dependencies, too (t9759686)
These functions cut an array of spans at a given character position, returning an array of remaining chunks (or undefined if nothing remains).
This class represents a collection of context menu items that have been registered with Atom's ContextMenuManager under a single CSS selector.
This is necessary for `node`s that do not have an `id`, which would cause the generated ID here to not match the ID generated in `_writeLink`.
To create a new type of component that handles interaction using the `Touchable` mixin, do the following:  - Initialize the `Touchable` state.
Try with type "junction" on Windows Junctions behave equally to true symlinks and can be created in non elevated terminal (well, not always..)
We add the length of the term so we can be ranked alongside the scores generated by `scoreCommonSubsequence` which also factors in the length.
We use this to accurately detect changes on disk - conflicts should not be reported if any saves finished while fetching the updated contents.
When modifying some of the properties a new instance needs to be created with all of the properties identical except for those being modified.
`__generatedMappings` and `__originalMappings` are arrays that hold the parsed mapping coordinates from the source map's "mappings" attribute.
chown starting from the first dir created by mkdirp, or the root dir, if none had to be created, so that we know that we get all the children.
e.g. for streaming directly from a remote server, w/ a known file a size, and not wanting to wait for incoming file to finish to get its size.
we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the sync guard flag.
- All remaining characters (including all printable ISO 8859-1 and WGL4 characters, Unicode control characters, etc.) have a column width of 1.
- Deactivating events while rearranging the DOM, preventing blurs/focuses, while guaranteeing that afterwards, the event system is reactivated.
- `measurements`: an object mapping names of profiled functions to profiling data including: - `aggregateTime`: total time spent in the method.
A specialized pseudo-event module to help keep track of components waiting to be notified when their DOM representations are available for use.
An exception thrown in a task can be handled by `process.on("uncaughtException") or `domain.on("error")`, but will otherwise crash the process.
Because we will never consider this node or any nodes before it again, this node must be the closest preceding node we have encountered so far.
Bug with Jest because we're going to the node_modules that is a sibling of what jest thinks our root (the dir with the package.json) should be.
But in the case of object literals, it might be called at a position where there is in fact a short hand identifier pattern or a data property.
Even if the "Show Differential Revision" preference is enabled, only show the column if there is at least one row with a Differential revision.
Finds the previous node in the tree in the natural order - from top to to bottom as is displayed in the file-tree panel, minus the indentation.
For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many bytes of output.
If `props` and `error` are both present, then sufficient data is ready to render, but an error occurred while fulfilling deferred dependencies.
If you want to print trailing commas in object literals, array expressions, functions calls and function definitions pass true for this option.
In the case the cursor does not correspond last cursor, walk through the edges to see if we can trim edges to only those after the last cursor.
Instead, we need to remove components from the root one by one, until either we find a prefix that fits, or we run out of components to remove.
It is possible that the error is from a configuration comment in a linted file, in which case there may not be a config set in this ruleSetIdx.
It may be that some of the nodes have already been removed, or that new nodes might have been inserted in the middle, for example by a binding.
Load all of the grammars synchronously because the top-level load() function should be synchronous so that it works as expected with require().
NOTE: this can get identifiers that are declared, if you want access to identifiers that are access but undeclared see getUndeclaredIdentifiers
Negated Rules Since we're *ignoring* things here, negating means that a file is re-included, if it would have been excluded by a previous rule.
Note that this is *almost always going to be the case*, unless the thing being written is some sort of unsupported type, and thus skipped over.
Relay contains the set of public methods used to initialize and orchestrate a React application that uses GraphQL to declare data dependencies.
Returns if the `rootPath` directory contains the `checkPath` which could be: - A file or directory path that's a direct child of the root path.
Select-all will be greyed out if there's nothing to select, so this adds a zero-width space so that we can later check whether it got selected.
Starting from the given a node (a property.key node here) looks forward until it finds the last token before a colon punctuator and returns it.
TODO(most): Fix: this assumes that the editor contents aren't changed while fetching the comments, that's okay now because we don't fetch them.
TODO: Strictly we should detect alternates which directly contain their parent union, or if all alternates indirectly contain the parent union.
The optional flag indicates whether parsing should use strict enforcement of the version draft-cavage-http-signatures-04 of the spec or beyond.
The subscription should fail again, but the children should be refetched and match the changed structure (i.e. include the new 'bar.baz' file).
This can only happen via state.decoder -- no other venue exists for pushing a zero-length chunk into state.buffer and triggering this behavior.
This exists as its own class to make it possible to reuse instances when multiple callers observe on text editors with the same grammar scopes.
This fragment should be added when some/all implementors of the node's type also implement `Node` but a `Node` fragment is not already present.
This one works, but since the filename is truncated once a space is found the extraction will not happen because the file has no .zip extension
Use `indefinite mode` to indicate an initializing period, Prefer using the `LoadingSpinner` component for surfacing non-deterministic progress.
Using Object.keys here, or else the vanilla for-in loop makes IE8 go into an infinite loop, because it iterates over the newly added props too.
We are currently silencing these warnings when using TestUtils.Simulate to avoid spurious warnings that result from the way we simulate events.
When console.log() (or .warn() or .error()) is called, it enqueues a request to atom-script via the UNIX socket to print the specified message.
When the popup is shown, we want to dispose it if the user manages to move the cursor off of the gutter glyph without moving it onto the popup.
Wrap each callback so that we don't leak the fact that subscribe is implemented with observables (by accepting Observers as well as callbacks).
half the angular distance from south pole Spherical excess E for a spherical triangle with vertices: south pole, previous point, current point.
inheritCoverGrammar function runs the given parse function with a new cover grammar context, and it propagates the flags outside of the parser.
stderr is automatically piped from the gradle process, so the user should see the error already, there is no need to do `console.log(e.stderr)`
A function can be passed as `onToken` option, which will cause Acorn to call that function with object in the same format as tokenize() returns.
A string If matched as a plain string, we need to escape its newlines, since the string needs to be preserved when generating the function body.
All Parser API node types can be used to identify node types, as well as Expression, Statement, and ScopeBody, which denote categories of nodes.
Assume new contents if the request failed Note that we do not retry the request using the "request-replay" module because it would take too long
Build a config object merging the base config (conf/eslint.json), the environments config (conf/environments.js) and eventually the user config.
Change this when you want to make sure the WindowedListView will re-render, for example when the result of `renderScrollComponent` might change.
Compute the character length of a line, taking into account collapsed ranges (see markText) that might hide parts, and join other lines onto it.
Controls whether iOS should automatically adjust the content inset for scroll views that are placed behind a navigation bar or tab bar/ toolbar.
Currently, the BuckToolbarStore's progress reporting is pretty useless so we omit `observeProgress` and just use the indeterminate progress bar.
If the user clicked on a ChangeSet ID, extract it from the DOM element via the data- attribute and find the corresponding Differential revision.
If we managed to parse the key and locate the key comment with the regex, then do a non-partial read and assert that we have consumed all bytes.
If you open Atom via Spotlight such that it opens with a tab named "untitled" that does not correspond to a file on disk, this will return null.
Note that we've removed escapeTextForBrowser() calls here since the whole string will be escaped when the attribute is injected into the markup.
Observes that a Mercurial event has occurred (e.g. histedit) that would potentially invalidate any data cached from responses from this service.
Perform a shallow check to ensure the value conforms to `CallValue` type: For performance reasons, skip recursively testing array/object values.
RelayRenderer does not synchronously update because the ready state (and therefore render arguments) for the new `queryConfig` is not yet known.
Resolve definitionPath based on the caller's module, and fallback to this file's module in case module.parent doesn't exist (we are using repl).
The `onMoreTasks` constructor argument is used to inform the owner that an async task has resolved and that the queue should be processed again.
The fundamental problem is that the way a menu item is notified that it was selected is that the Atom command associated with the item is fired.
The jQuery object is actually just the init constructor 'enhanced' Need init if jQuery is called (just allow error to be thrown if not included)
The reason why we need this two-phases process is to deal with composite props such as transform which can receive values from multiple parents.
This class keeps the PathSets passed to it up to date by using file system watchers to observe when relevant file additions and deletions occur.
This is probably confusing for Flow because it cannot tell which properties are defined during initialization since this is not the constructor.
This list is generated using: `require("repl")._builtinLibs.concat('repl').sort()` This particular list is as per nodejs v0.12.2 and iojs v0.7.1
This might not be true in the case of a simple test that only requires React and the TestUtils in conjunction with an inline-requires transform.
This modules adds a jasmine matcher toEqualSpecsIn that can be used to compare the specs in two different "describe" functions and their result.
This parameter is needed when the two source maps aren't in the same directory, and the source map to be applied contains relative source paths.
This takes an object and a property name instead of a value to allow us to define the arguments for use by chain before the property exists yet.
Traverses up the ancestors of the supplied node to find a node that is a DOM representation of a React component rendered by this copy of React.
We jump through these hoops because there can be many thousands of mappings, and parsing them is expensive, so we only want to do it if we must.
We want to be the furthest left on the right side of the status bar so as not to leave a conspicuous gap (or cause jitter) when nothing is busy.
`ResponderEventPlugin` must occur before `SimpleEventPlugin` so that preventing default on events is convenient in `SimpleEventPlugin` handlers.
bit of special logic to read the specified sort of ignore files, and a filter that prevents it from picking up anything excluded by those files.
every time we dive into a deeper node_modules folder, the "family" list that gets passed along uses the previous "family" list as its __proto__.
reading a tar is a lot like reading a directory However, we're actually not going to run the ctor, since it does a stat and various other stuff.
webpack attempts to inject a shim for setImmediate if it is used as a global, so we have to work around that to avoid bundling unnecessary code.
AST walker module for Mozilla Parser API compatible trees A simple walk is one where you simply specify callbacks to be called on specific nodes.
Additional example is the .containsSelection property - having it allows efficient selection removal from the entire tree or one of its branches.
Because the pending fetch is always canceled, we need to build a new set of queries that includes the updated variables and initiate a new fetch.
Creates sets of rule configurations which can be used for linting and initializes registry errors to zero for those configurations (side effect).
Do not throw when any of them (`ca`, `cert`, or `key`) are undefined because that will be the case when the server is started in "insecure" mode.
Don't log errors if the command returns a nonzero exit code, because status returns nonzero if it is reporting any issues, even when it succeeds.
Firefox v8.01 (and possibly others) exhibited strange behavior when mounting `onmousemove` events at some node that was not the document element.
For example, if you call run(promise1) and then run(promise2), and promise2 resolves first, the second callsite would receive a 'success' status.
Hierarchically the controlling toolbar should be above, and practically this ensures the popover in this build toolbar stacks on top of other UI.
If an element has no children, React guarantees it will never re-render the element (which would wipe out the web component's work in this case).
If the new tasks contain the one we were waiting to restore from the user's previous session (or we have no active task), make it the active one.
If the server is currently compiling, all other requests will automatically return null (unless the `blocking` parameter is explicitly provided).
In jest environment, XmlHttpRequest doesn't exist so getOwnPropertyDescriptor returns undefined and defineProperty default for writable is false.
Integration test, testing the combination of JSX with our unit of abstraction, `ReactCompositeComponent` does not ever add superfluous DOM nodes.
It's possible that the URI opens before the remote connection has finished loading (or the remote connection cannot be restored for some reason).
Most of the time, the context will directly get a view model object, but if a function is given, we call the function to retrieve the view model.
Only server-side rendering really needs this option (see `ReactServerRendering`), but server-side uses `ReactServerRenderingTransaction` instead.
Override XHR.open to allow this page to be located outside the devtools tree, and resources to be selectively mapped back into the devtools tree.
Performance:  - Making a stylesheet from a style object makes it possible to refer to it by ID instead of creating a new style object every time.
Publishes a registration name that is used to identify dispatched events and can be used with `EventPluginHub.putListener` to register listeners.
Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met: 1.
Replace the contents of the mappedNodes array, thereby updating the record of which nodes would be deleted if valueToMap was itself later removed
Returns a box for a given cursor position, which may have an 'other' property containing the position of the secondary cursor on a bidi boundary.
Since our implementation is spec-compliant for the most part we can safely delegate to a built-in version if exists and is implemented correctly.
Since we can't define a non-enumerable property on the object we'll hijack one of the less-used non-enumerable properties to save our hash on it.
Skip key warning if the type isn't valid since our key validation logic doesn't expect a non-string/function type and can throw confusing errors.
Standard/simple iteration through an event's collected dispatches, but stops at the first dispatch execution returning true, and returns that id.
TODO(mbolin): The architecture should be chosen from a dropdown menu like it is in Xcode rather than hardcoding things to iphonesimulator-x86_64.
The returned composite link function, when called, will return an unlink function that tearsdown all directives created during the linking phase.
The stylesheets will be loaded asynchronously, so there might be a slight visual glitch if the widget is drawn before the stylesheets are loaded.
The synchronous exist check is used to avoid the race condition of fast updates, when the watcher is called twice as the file is created/removed.
This is separated into its own decorator so that only those who want to use the holding functionality have to and others can just use an emitter.
This is to resolve many edge cases that come about from a listener on a lower-in-DOM node causing structural changes at places higher in the DOM.
To enable debugging, we need to set our pattern or append it to any existing pre-configured pattern to avoid disabling logging for other packages
WARNING: This method will not be used in production mode as in that mode we replace wrapper component View with generated native wrapper RCTView.
We can't produce one of these solely with `Relay.QL`, so we use a node from `Relay.QL` as a basis and attach the appropriate args and ref params.
We explicitly check for the existence of an owner since it's possible for an element created outside a composite to be deeply mutated and reused.
When adding a fat query, consider *all* of the data that might change as a result of the mutation - not just data that we currently use in Relay.
When lineObj is true, the Pos objects returned contain a line object, rather than a line number (used to prevent looking up the same line twice).
for now we've either finished the set, and the suffix is pattern.substr(i), or we have *not* closed the set, and need to escape the leading brace
globals included because of `npm link` -- as far as the package requesting the link is concerned, the linked package is always installed globally
here, we intercept npm validating the remote origin url on one of the clones we've done previously and return the original url that was requested
however, directories have to be re-tested against rules with a "/" appended, because "a/b/" will only match if "a/b" is a dir, and not otherwise.
if a sub-query was split, then we must track the entire field, which will be a superset of the `trackedNode` from traversing any metadata fields.
npm will log a "verbose" message about this when it happens, but it is a rare enough edge case that we don't have to be super concerned about it.
try to rmdir first, and only readdir on ENOTEMPTY or EEXIST (SunOS) if we guessed wrong, and it's not a directory, then raise the original error.
we need the check for style in case a browser which returns unreliable values for getComputedStyle silently falls back to the reliable elem.style
workingDirectoryLocalPath The local path to the workingDirectory of the repository (i.e. if it's a remote directory, the URI minus the hostname).
- If aPath is a URL or a data URI, aPath is returned, unless aPath is a scheme-relative URL: Then the scheme of aRoot, if any, is prepended first.
Based on Selection.js, but modified to be suitable for react and has a couple of bug fixes (doesn't assume buttons have range selections allowed).
Creates a function that invokes `func` with the `this` binding of the created function and arguments from `start` and beyond provided as an array.
Delay hiding the combobox long enough for a click inside the combobox to trigger on it in case the blur was caused by a click inside the combobox.
Even though we're ignoring the cache, we will still invoke the callback immediately with `ready: true` if `querySet` can be resolved by the cache.
For example, "Documentation/*.html" matches "Documentation/git.html" but not "Documentation/ppc/ppc.html" or "tools/perf/Documentation/perf.html".
Functions were used because (among other reasons) that's the most elegant way to allow for the emptyArray one always to give a new array instance.
If `readyState` is not supplied, the previously rendered `readyState` will continue to be rendered (or null if there is no previous `readyState`).
If the DbgpProperty represents an empty array or object, the `pagesize` and `numchildren` will be omitted so we handle this "zero" case specially.
In order to avoid back tracking, it returns `null` if the position is not a MethodDefinition and the caller is responsible to visit other options.
In the case the cursor does not correspond first cursor, walk through the edges to see if we can trim edges to only those before the first cursor.
It is needed in order to move 'visually' through bi-directional text -- i.e., pressing left should make the cursor go left, even when in RTL text.
JSXMemberExpressions can only contain identifiers so we do not allow any sort of breaking between accesses unlike in a standard member expression.
Make the callback - expects an editing node (table row), the column number that is being edited, the text that used to be there, and the new text.
Normally, we'd just disable the `UIScrollView`, but a touch has already began on it, the `UIScrollView` will not accept being disabled after that.
Once the node is the responder, you can rely on every start/end event being processed by the gesture and `gestureState` being updated accordingly.
PaintInvalidationTracking events provide a paintId and a nodeId which we can use to update the paintId for all other invalidation tracking events.
Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:  1.
Returns whether or not this touch end event makes it such that there are no longer any touches that started inside of the current `responderInst`.
Similarly, the idekeyRegex filters incoming dbgp connections by idekey, and pid filters connections by process id (appid in the dbgp terminology).
Since elements are immutable after the owner is rendered, we can do a cheap identity compare here to determine if this is a superfluous reconcile.
So two `touchStart`/`touchMove`s that occur simultaneously are received as two separate touch event dispatches - when they arguably should be one.
The .comments field of the Node type is hidden, so we only visit it if the visitor defines visitBlock or visitLine, and value.comments is defined.
The EACCES fallback is a workaround for npm's `sudo` behavior, where it drops the permissions before invoking any child processes (like node-gyp).
The function does not return the proxy module directly, but rather returns a 'factory' method that should be called with a ClientComponent object.
The result of the dependency extraction is an de-duplicated array of dependencies, and an array of offsets to the string literals with module IDs.
There is no guarantee that `this.state` will be immediately updated, so accessing `this.state` after calling this method may return the old value.
These should be set up in the preview window if this error is seen it is because the function tried to run before the iframe has completely loaded
This context menu wrapper exists to address some of the limitations in the ContextMenuManager: https://atom.io/docs/api/latest/ContextMenuManager.
This is a hook provided to support rendering React components while ensuring that the apparent scroll position of its `container` does not change.
This will be non-null if the user has entered distraction-free mode without toggling it off, but has manually opened one or more of the providers.
TypeScript will look for the .d.ts files in each ancestor directory, so there may not be a file at the referenced path as it climbs the hierarchy.
While source maps are intended to be compressed and deduplicated, the TypeScript compiler sometimes generates source maps with duplicates in them.
`FriendsStatusDisplay` renders nulls as empty children (it's a convention of `FriendsStatusDisplay`, nothing related to React or these test cases.
`observedTopOfStack` merely represents what we've observed and this first `setState` is only executed to update debugging overlays/navigation bar.
because v-model has a lower priority than v-for, the v-model is not bound here yet, so we have to retrive it in the actual updateModel() function.
do a bit of filtering at this point, so that we don't need to fetch versions for more than one thing, but also don't accidentally a whole project.
http://www.nonblocking.io/2011/06/windownexttick.html Safari 6.0.5 (at least) intermittently fails to create message ports on a page's first load.
https://github.com/tj/node-blocked/blob/master/index.js  The blocked module checks and reports every event loop block time over a given threshold.
if this tree location requested the same module then we KNOW it isn't compatible because if it were findRequirement would have found that version.
in debug + async mode, when a watcher callbacks throws, we also throw the saved before-push error so the full cross-tick stack trace is available.
nor the names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.
"expected" will be `true` or `false` if the body should be a block statement or not, or `null` if it doesn't matter, depending on the rule options.
(At least, this functionality is not exposed in the libclang python bindings.) So we derive the location of a symbol using the symbol's 'spelling'.
@param fixtureName The name of the subdirectory of the fixtures/ directory within the nuclide-test-helpers package directory that should be copied.
After the directory specified by fixtureName is copied, its .hg-rename folder will be renamed to .hg, so that it can act as a mercurial repository.
All of these matrix transforms are not general purpose utilities, and are only suitable for being inlined for the use of building up interpolators.
Animations are an important part of modern UX, and the `Animated` library is designed to make them fluid, powerful, and easy to build and maintain.
Assets  When a vm is present (instance creation), we need to do a three-way merge between constructor options, instance options and parent options.
Builds up two arrays: - "dominatedNodes" is a continuous array, where each node owns an interval (can be empty) with corresponding dominated nodes.
Call the provided function in a context within which calls to `setState` and friends are batched such that components aren't updated unnecessarily.
Come a time when root fields support more than just identifying arguments, write a test to ensure that non-identifying args don't get stripped out.
Experimental: When true, offscreen child views (whose `overflow` value is `hidden`) are removed from their native backing superview when offscreen.
For a multiple-select box, compare the new selection count to the previous one But if nothing was selected before, the selection can't have changed
Given the parsed result of a definition file, generate a remote proxy module that exports the definition's API, but internally calls RPC functions.
If passed an array of button configurations, each button should include a `text` key, as well as optional `onPress` and `style` keys (see example).
If possible, erase it totally (not always possible - someone else might just hold a reference to it then call unmemoizeDomNodeAndDescendants again)
If we couldn't locate the key comment, though, there may be whitespace shenanigans going on that have conjoined the comment to the rest of the key.
It would be nice to store the information on the container (Pane, PaneAxis) itself, but Atom doesn't give us a way to persist metadata about those.
NOTE**: on iOS, you need to add the `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` key in Info.plist to enable geolocation, otherwise it will fail silently.
NOTE: We can step in this function only if `afterCompile` event is broken This is issue for node v0.12: https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/25266
Nuclide can't handle nested arrays well in settings, so we save it in a flat array and fix up each pair or entries before using it in the transform
Otherwise it does not fill the whole panel, which might be alright except it means that the resize-handle doesn't extend all the way to the bottom.
Recrusively traverse an object to evoke all converted getters, so that every nested property inside the object is collected as a "deep" dependency.
Represents a query fragment that is conditional upon the active route as a function that returns either a literal fragment or a fragment reference.
See here: http://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html The additional options we provide: queueName string The queue on which to block dependent calls.
Setting the type on a radio button after the value resets the value in IE6-9 Reset value to default in case type is set after value during creation
Start a timeout if this is the first click, if the timeout is canceled before it fires, then a double clicked happened or another link was clicked.
Takes a map returned by HgRepositoryClient.getBlameAtHead() and reformats it as a Map of line numbers to blame info to display in the blame gutter.
The Drawer (typically used for navigation) is rendered with `renderNavigationView` and direct children are the main view (where your content goes).
The challenging case is the Obj-C selector, e.g. 'objectForKey:usingBlock:', which may appear in code as multiple segments separated by other text.
These don't have to be accurate -- the result of them being wrong would just be a slight flicker on the first wheel scroll (if it is large enough).
These will be regexps, except in the case of "**", which is set to the GLOBSTAR object for globstar behavior, and will not contain any / characters
This is not a drop-in replacement for `ListView` - many features are not supported, including section headers, dataSources, horizontal layout, etc.
This is the ratio that is used to calculate the absolute font size, so any elements that heavily depend on that should use this to do calculations.
This option is here so that it's accessible and defaults to false when `ReactDOMComponent` and `ReactTextComponent` checks it in `mountComponent`.`
Transaction was committed but another transaction with the same collision key is pending, so the transaction has been queued to send to the server.
Useful for simple use-cases where you don't want to deal with listening to events and updating the value prop to keep the controlled state in sync.
We don't use SyntheticEvent.getPooled in order to not have to worry about properly destroying any properties assigned from `eventData` upon release
We set this to true at first, because any actions that shouldn't happen until "later" should generally also not happen before the first write call.
We set this to true at first, becuase any actions that shouldn't happen until "later" should generally also not happen before the first write call.
We want to represent the fact that it's not part of the tracked contents, so we manually add an exception for it via the _isPathWithinHgRepo check.
When a component's children are updated, a series of update configuration objects are created in order to batch and serialize the required changes.
When this is the case, this prop will fill the rest of the scrollview with a color to avoid setting a background and creating unnecessary overdraw.
Wrap a `key` value explicitly provided by the user to distinguish it from implicitly-generated keys generated by a component's index in its parent.
You can use other URLs, like a location (e.g. "geo:37.484847,-122.148386"), a contact, or any other URL that can be opened with the installed apps.
files should *always* get into tarballs in a user-writable state, even if they're being installed from some wackey vm-mounted read-only filesystem.
since there is no setter, you shouldn't be able to write to it PhantomJS throws when a property with no setter is set but other real browsers don't
there is no safe way to do a one-step clone to a treeish that isn't guaranteed to be a branch, so explicitly check out the treeish once it's cloned
- If something *is* already the responder, the "appropriate place" is the first common ancestor of the event target and the current `responderInst`.
@internal  Compares two query root nodes and returns true if the nodes fetched by `thisRoot` would be a superset of the nodes fetched by `thatRoot`.
A decorator for adding Atom-style observation methods to a React component class whose whose subscribers are invoked whenever the component updates.
Any declarations that occur inside the catch body that do not have the same name as the catch parameter should count as bindings in the outer scope.
Here we added a hook to Error.prepareStackTrace to achieve following goals: 1) Whenever `error.stack` is called, error.stackTrace will be generated.
Here we intentionally circumvent, to a degree, the logic in the _fetchChildKeys which wouldn't schedule a new fetch if there is already one running.
If at least one of the diagnostics is an error rather than the warning, display the glyph in the gutter to represent an error rather than a warning.
If the predicate returns a non-null value it signifies that the handling of the sub-branch is complete and the descent to children is not performed.
If there's native implementation of given symbol, let's fallback to it to ensure proper interoperability with other native functions e.g. Array.from
If this was the active view, choose the first remaining view (in insertion order) or, if there are no remaining views, choose nothing (`undefined`).
In addition to subscribing to all subsequent events, this method will also handle any events that have already been emitted, held, and not released.
It seems strange for Flow to report errors in one place when run from one root, and not report errors in that same place when run from another root.
Mapping from normalized, camelcased property names to a configuration that specifies how the associated DOM property should be accessed or rendered.
Note that topologicalSortBindings has already filtered out any nonexistent binding handlers, so bindingKeyAndHandler.handler will always be nonnull.
Note: it might be more performant to maintain the sorting as we insert them, rather than as we serialize them, but the big O is the same either way.
Records are "created" whenever an entry did not previously exist for the `recordID`, including cases when a `recordID` is created with a null value.
Reports have shown that much more than 5 or 10 cause issues for corporate networks, private repos or situations where internet bandwidth is limited.
Scrolls to the given line/column at the given editor broadcasts the editor instance on an observable (subject) available through the getGoToLocation
So we construct the hash from this uniqueID to avoid memory leaks and the IE cloneNode bug where it clones properties in addition to the attributes.
The changed files status tree takes 1/5 of the width and lives on the right most, while being vertically splt with the revision timeline stack pane.
The same would be true for `ReactNative`, but we must maintain a mapping that we can send efficiently serializable strings across native boundaries.
The walking function is called once for each snippet of JS and is passed that snippet and the its original associated source's line/column location.
This doesn't accept stack item `id`s, which implies that all existing items are destroyed, and then potentially recreated according to `routeStack`.
This formats requires based on the left hand side of the require, unless it is a simple require expression in which case there is no left hand side.
This function returns HgRepositoryDescription filled with a repoPath and originURL iff it finds that the given directory is within an Hg repository.
This is needed in order to move 'visually' through bi-directional text -- i.e., pressing left should make the cursor go left, even when in RTL text.
This means, of course, that it'll only work if you already have a tar implementation, and some of them will not properly unpack the fixtures anyway.
Unfortunately, there is no Promise.isPromise() akin to Array.isArray(), so we use the heuristic that the argument is an object with a then() method.
We need this module here because environments such as IE and Rhino don't necessarilly expose the 'console' API and browserify uses it to log things.
We use the seedrandom module to get around this non-deterministic aspect -- so it is safe to assume that if the tests fail, then d3's RNG is broken.
Workaround IE 6/7 issue - https://github.com/SteveSanderson/knockout/issues/197 - http://www.matts411.com/post/setting_the_name_attribute_in_ie_dom/
You should call this method in rare circumstances only, such as when a new version of the app removes support for all types of remote notifications.
`requestFlush` is implemented using a strategy based on data collected from every available SauceLabs Selenium web driver worker at time of writing.
node.js internal scripts have no path, just a filename regular scripts have always a full path (i.e their name contains at least one path separator)
non-optimistic updates check for the existence of a generated client ID (from the above `if` clause) and link the client ID to the actual server ID.
now either drained or ended debug("either draining, or ended", this._bufferLength, this._ended) means that we've flushed out all that we can so far.
this is removed during compilation, but because compilation is cached, when the component is used elsewhere this attribute will remain at link time.
- The `EventPluginHub` will then process each event by annotating them with "dispatches", a sequence of listeners and IDs that care about that event.
----------------- Plugin Resolver is always considered potentially cacheable The "resolve" method decides whether to use cached or fetch new version.
Also, there may previously have been leading comment nodes (created by rewritten string-based templates) that have since been removed during binding.
Any "resolved precise dependency" things that aren't already on this object get added, and then that's passed to the next generation of installation.
Binds a list of properties to a function that verifies that the opening curly brace is on the same line as its controlling statement of a given node.
Consider detecting such cases (perhaps with a checksum included in the fix) and rejecting the fixes, since we can't accurately track their locations.
Deserializes a url with query parameters: args, argTypes to an array of the original arguments of the same types the client called the function with.
Evaluates the code in the console as if user typed it manually and invokes the callback when the result message is received and added to the console.
FIXME: Unnecessary as long as we have to have the tarball to resolve all deps, which is progressively seeming to be likely for the indefinite future.
For now, we centralize some logic about how particular service calls should be formatted for display in log messages and the Nuclide Service Monitor.
However, this is still not an official public API, and we reserve the right to remove it at any time if we create a real public property writers API.
If the axis is oriented the same way as the split, and the container that we're going to add our item to isn't split itself, return an existing pane.
If the left.value is not "new", or the left.first.value is a "." then safely assume that this is not "new Array()" and possibly not "new Object()"...
If we have a top level node that is excluded, get rid of it completely (not keeping children), since bottom up data relies entirely on the root node.
Instead, the way to achieve this effect is to create an ordinary TextEditor and then override any methods that would allow it to change its contents.
Intentionally **not** an arrow function because Atom sets the context when calling this and allows dynamically setting values by assigning to `this`.
Long term, we need either (a) JS code to not depend on anything outside this directory, or (b) Come up with a way to declare this dependency in Buck.
Merges changes that are within a single operation, ore are close together with an origin that allows merging (starting with "+") into a single event.
Mounting is the process of initializing a React component by creating its representative DOM elements and inserting them into a supplied `container`.
Once onNewLayout is called after offscreen rendering has completed, includeInLayout will be set true and the finished cell can be dropped into place.
Returns a token that can be parsed using parseRangeClientID to recover the attributes needed to retrieve the corresponding items from a GraphQLRange.
Some browsers cannot use `innerHTML` to render certain elements standalone, so we wrap them, render the wrapped nodes, then extract the desired node.
Standard unmounting of the component that is rendered into `containerID`, but will also execute a command to remove the actual container view itself.
The downside would be that if someone added a closer file with fileName to pathToFile (or deleted the one that was cached), then we would have a bug.
The pretty printer allows a dangling Comment node to act as a Statement when the Comment can't be attached to any other non-Comment node in the tree.
There should be two scripts: one for the main page and another one which is source of console API(see InjectedScript._ensureCommandLineAPIInstalled).
These multiple individual change touch events are are always bookended by `onResponderGrant`, and one of (`onResponderRelease/onResponderTerminate`).
This function can be used to generate a unique id for fragments constructed at runtime and is guaranteed not to conflict with statically created ids.
This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews, most of which are offscreen.
This is meant to be the single point through which all pane item creation goes (new pane item creation, deserialization, splitting, reopening, etc.).
To achieve this, we create a UNIX domain socket whose location we pass to Atom so we can redefine `console.log()` to write to the UNIX domain socket.
Triggered event must either 1) have no namespace, or 2) have namespace(s) a subset or equal to those in the bound event (both can have no namespace).
We currently don't have a way to track moves here but if we use iterators instead of for..in we can zip the iterators and check if an item has moved.
With a top-level Navigator, you have more control over how to present the modal scene over the rest of your app by using the configureScene property.
You would typically create a single instance of a `Transaction` for reuse multiple times, that potentially is used to wrap several different methods.
fragment: if this instance is compiled inside a Fragment, it needs to reigster itself as a child of that fragment for attach/detach to work properly.
non-npm registries can and will return unnormalized data, plus even the npm registry may have package data normalized with older normalization rules.
recompile the line with the reset **just** before the actual loop so that we insert in to the correct location (instead of possibly outside the logic
reset directives before every capture in production mode, so that when unlinking we don't need to splice them out (which turns out to be a perf hit).
@internal  Helper for writing the result of one or more queries/operations into the store, updating tracked queries, and recording changed record IDs.
A break doesn't have to happen here but whenever we choose to break at a scopeBreak we must also break at all other scopeBreaks within the same scope.
A configuration can be a single number (severity), or an array where the first element in the array is the severity, and is the only required element.
A function that can be optionally passed to ProcessOutputView to override ProcessOutputView's default behavior for handling new data from the process.
As such, any tests for it that need to use Atom's built-in test runner need to live elsewhere, which is why they are in the top-level spec/ directory.
Before acting on a set of nodes that were previously outputted by a template function, we have to reconcile them against what is in the DOM right now.
Check to see if the first element inside an array is an object and on the same line as the node If the node is not an array then it will return false.
Filter calls to only those that specify conditions on the returned results (ex: `orderby(TOP_STORIES)`), removing generic calls (ex: `first`, `find`).
For lines with widgets, make an attempt to find and reuse the existing element, so that widgets aren't needlessly removed and re-inserted into the dom
For some reason, setting `container.style.display` to `"flex"` directly here doesn't work (something clears it) so we add a class to style it instead.
However, npm *itself* excludes these from its own package, so that it can be more easily bootstrapped using old and non-compliant tar implementations.
However, you should not rely on it being a constant size, because on different platforms and screen densities its value may be calculated differently.
If `checked` or `value` are not supplied (or null/undefined), user actions that affect the checked state or value will trigger updates to the element.
If no column is provided, returns all mappings corresponding to a either the line we are searching for or the next closest line that has any mappings.
If this is made configurable, consider using autocomplete-plus' minimumWordLength setting, as per https://github.com/atom/autocomplete-plus/issues/594
If two touches start, one moves five in a direction, then stops and the other touch moves fives in the same direction, the cumulative distance is ten.
Initial dimensions are set before `runApplication` is called so they should be available before any other require's are run, but may be updated later.
Instead of the "map" field, it's also possible to have a "url" field specifying a URL to retrieve a source map from, but that's currently unsupported.
Let the component unmount before propagating the final message change to the model, So the subsequent change event avoids re-rendering this component.
Polyfill for XMLHttpRequest2 FormData API, allowing multipart POST requests with mixed data (string, native files) to be submitted via XMLHttpRequest.
Recomputing which rows to render is batched up and run asynchronously to avoid wastful updates, e.g. from multiple layout updates in rapid succession.
Relatedly, when upgrading, if a bundled module is replacing an existing module we want to choose the bundled version, not the version we're replacing.
Reset pending fields Even if this component is scheduled for another update in ReactUpdates, it would still be ignored because these fields are reset.
Returns an object mapping from every known type in the defCache to the most specific supertype whose name is an own property of the candidates object.
Super dangerous and experimental - rows and all their decendents must be fully stateless otherwise recycling their instances may introduce nasty bugs.
Take note if the _read call is sync or async (ie, if the read call has returned yet), so that we know whether or not it's safe to emit 'readable' etc.
That is why we first need to collect information about the nodes in the first snapshot and then pass it to the second snapshot to calclulate the diff.
The `render` callback can return `undefined` to continue rendering the last view rendered (e.g. when transitioning from one `queryConfig` to another).
The filename can't end with a dot because this is known to cause issues in Windows See: http://superuser.com/questions/230385/dots-at-end-of-file-name
The method receives two predicates The first is invoked upon descent and with its return value controls whether need to traverse deeper into the tree.
These carry several kinds of properties to help the parser use them properly (the presence of these properties is what categorizes them as operators).
This is the format commonly used in other libraries and for test vectors, and is equivalent to the hex dump of the key in little-endian binary format.
To return the position we are searching for, we must first find the mapping for the given position and then return the opposite position it points to.
Tries to stringify with JSON.stringify and toString, but catches exceptions (e.g. from circular objects) and always returns a string and never throws.
Use "peek" to avoid creating a subscription in any computed that we're executing in the context of (for consistency with mutating regular observables)
Use an extremely generous timeout when running a method of BuckProject that runs Buck because we have seen tests time out in CI with a timeout of 20s.
Used to track when rendering is in progress so the parent can avoid wastedful re-renders that are just going to be invalidated once the cell finishes.
Using this ID scheme, the nearest common ancestor ID is the longest common prefix of the two IDs that immediately preceded a "marker" in both strings.
(BIT-MAX - (unsigned)val + 1) * -1  The astute observer, may think that this doesn't make sense for 8-bit numbers (really it isn't necessary for them).
@internal  `RelayQueryTransform` is a `RelayQueryVisitor` subclass that simplifies the process of traversing, filtering, or transforming a Relay Query.
@internal  `flattenRelayQuery(query)` returns a clone of `query` with fields inside of fragments recursively flattened into the nearest ancestor field.
A file path will not appear in the returned Map if it is not in the repo, if it has no changes, or if there is a pending `hg diff` call for it already.
All components are capable of //being// referenced by owner components, but only ReactOwner components are capable of //referencing// owned components.
Also remember the case of the header name because lots of broken servers expect Host instead of host and we want the caller to be able to specify this.
Convenience wrapper around validateConnection that gracefully attempts to extract the connection identified by `connectionName` from the `parentField`.
If `filterUnterminatedRange` is supplied, it will be invoked with any fields from `subjectNode` that are connections and unterminated in `patternNode`.
If the `value` prop is not updated, the component will continue to render the supplied `value` prop instead of the expected result of any user actions.
If this is a controlled radio button group, forcing the input that was previously checked to update will cause it to be come re-checked as appropriate.
In order to remove those results from the results of this file, we need to overwrite it() and describe() just in RuleTester to do nothing but run code.
Keep this file in vanilla JavaScript so we can add perf measuring hooks and not have to worry about accounting for transpile costs or `import` hosting.
Note that this function assumes node EventEmitter semantics: namely, that adding the same combination of eventName and callback adds a second listener.
Or, `x` may be a function which is evaluated, being passed the range, the array of values, and the current index `i`, returning an array of thresholds.
Replace each paired surrogate with a single ASCII symbol to avoid throwing on regular expressions that are only valid in combination with the "u" flag.
Returns a function that estimates the height of a line, to use as first approximation until the line becomes visible (and is thus properly measurable).
Since the require module is loaded before any of the modules, this ErrorUtils must be defined (and the handler set) globally before requiring anything.
TODO: there is no `rawHeaders` in node 0.10.* We can wrap parser to find raw headers, but it's not so useful to see original string So, maybe won't fix
That is, if modifiedPath is /A/B/C/D and pathPrefixToSkip is /A/B/ (or /A/B), `directories` will be populated with '/A/B/C/', but not '/A/' or '/A/B/'.
The range of the temporary ports for connection are all taken, This is temporal with many http requests, but should be counted as a network away event.
The same TextEditor must be returned to prevent Atom from creating multiple tabs for the same file, because Atom doesn't cache pending opener promises.
There is no defined way to represent negative deltas, so it's illegal to diff B from A where the time denoted by B is later than the time denoted by A.
This allows us to transclude a template node/fragment before the instance is created, so the processed fragment can then be cloned and reused in v-for.
This filters out extraneous properties from `GraphQL.*` nodes such as `fields` or `fragments`, and reduces metadata down to compare only truthy values.
This is primarily useful idiomatically for overridable function endpoints which always need to be callable, since JS lacks a null-call idiom ala Cocoa.
This method is platform dependent: it accepts almost any regular expression values but then tries to compile and run them using system's RegExp object.
To solve this problem, we patch the errors in loggingEvent.data and convert it to an Object with 'name', 'message', 'stack' and 'stackTrace' as fields.
Use a TextEditor instead of a path so that: - If there are multiple editors for a file, we always jump to outline item locations in the correct editor.
We feature detect to determine the best RNG source, normalizing to a function that returns 128-bits of randomness, since that's what's usually required
We need to maintain the instance methods of the provided gadget (since that's how Atom will interact with it), so we create our new one by subclassing.
When a request is sent to the server, mutations can optionally construct an optimistic response that has the same shape as the server response payload.
When closing a project path, we remove all stack entries contained in that path which are not also contained in a project path which is remaining open.
Why: Because `dangerouslyReplaceNodeWithMarkupByID` relies on being able to unmount a component with a `rootNodeID`, then mount a new one in its place,
X-Requested-With header For cross-domain requests, seeing as conditions for a preflight are akin to a jigsaw puzzle, we simply never set it to be sure.
hasPositiveNumericValue: Whether the property must be positive numeric or parse as a positive numeric and should be removed when set to a falsey value.
resolves chains of symlinks of unlimited depth, returning a list of paths it's seen in the process when it hits either a symlink cycle or a non-symlink
@param `maximumTries` the number of times the `retryFunction` can fail to get a valid response before the `retryLimit` is terminated reporting an error.
@param pathPrefixToSkip Optionally, a string that, if found at the beginning of the modifiedPath, will be skipped when computing the parent directories.
After setting up the mocks, you must invalidate the require cache and then re-require the module under test so that it picks up the mocked dependencies.
But because it is a transient file, watchman may not pick up on it, especially if the Mercurial action is quick (e.g. a commit, as opposed to a rebase).
But this should be fine, because the client of LocalHgService should be reacting to the 'onHgRepoStateDidChange' event that follows the Mercurial event.
Does so such that this setup method may be used on an instance that is already initialized, in a way that does not consume additional memory upon reuse.
If previous iteration zeroed out, double until we get *something* Use a string for doubling factor so we don't accidentally see scale as unchanged below
If the array items are observables, though, they will be unwrapped in executeTemplateForArrayItem and managed within setDomNodeChildrenFromArrayMapping.
It computes a key based on a secret key with a public component (opponent's public key or curve base point if not given) by using scalar multiplication.
It turns out that returning an HTMLElement with a getTitle() method is sufficient to add a pane with the result of getTitle() as the title for the pane.
Partial state is allocated outside of the function closure so it can be reused with every call, avoiding memory allocation when this function is called.
Performs equality by iterating through keys on an object and returning false when any key has values which are not strictly equal between the arguments.
So, currently, it would only work if there is no `hh_client` or `.hhconfig` where the `HackWorker` model will diagnose with the updated editor contents.
TODO: I suspect we should key the local service off of the presence of a .hhconfig file rather than having a single HackLanguage for all local requests.
The format loop is as follows: original rgb(a) hsl(a) nickname (if the color has a nickname) if the color is simple: - shorthex (if has short hex) - hex
These touches don't just represent all active touches, rather it also includes any touches that are not active, but are in the process of being removed.
This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews, most of which are offscreen.
This is better than having plugins be ordered in the same order that they are injected because that ordering would be influenced by the packaging order.
This isn't strictly necessary (since all the information can be derived from the original event), but it makes our dashboard a little easier to process.
This method should always* be called before rendering a child component whose fragment was deferred (unless that child can handle null or missing data).
This way the intermediate state isn't to go to 0 and trigger this expensive recursive detaching to then re-attach everything on the very next operation.
This will return a new config with `"extends": "eslint:recommended"` and only the rules which have configurations different from the recommended config.
Use this as an opportunity to `return false` when you're certain that the transition to the new props/state/context will not require a component update.
When DevTools are opening in the inspect element mode, the first target comes in much later than the InspectorFrontendAPI.enterInspectElementMode event.
While the APIs remain compatible with Navigator, it is built with good intention by using the new Navigation API such as `NavigationAnimatedView`...etc.
`callback` is invoked with the final value after stopping the animation, which is useful for updating state to match the animation position with layout.
ensure that .ignore files always show up at the top of the list that way, they can be read before proceeding to handle other entries in that same folder
io.js v3.x.x shipped with "ia32" but should have been "x86" Captures all the logic required to determine download URLs, local directory and  file names.
isfunc     - true if block is a function body isfatarrow - true if its a body of a fat arrow function iscase      - true if block is a switch case block
t7114196: Given the current implementation of HgRepositoryClient, each root directory will always correspond to a unique instance of HgRepositoryClient.
A DiagnosticProvider will typically subscribe to only one, depending on whether it wants to be notified whenever a file changes or only when it is saved.
Add to the resolved list If there's an exact equal endpoint, replace instead of adding This can happen because the name might not be known from the start
Also iterate through all the previous props to catch any that have been removed and make sure native gets the signal so it can reset them to the default.
Also, sometimes we want to have a fallback Pass in a callback to wait for the fallback on failures After the first lookup, always returns the same thing.
Deserialization happens before the gadgets are available, so we need to serialize gadgets as placeholders (which are later replaced with the real thing).
Find the deepest React component completely containing the root of the passed-in instance (for use when entire React trees are nested within each other).
For Curve25519 DH keys, we need to apply some bit mask on generated keys: clear bit 0, 1, 2 of first byte clear bit 7 of last byte set bit 6 of last byte
For all others, drop the lineNumber until we have a mapping above, since providing the lineNumber incorrectly can result in errors or confusing behavior.
For instance, in the expression `(1 + 2) * 3`, the BinaryExpression whose operator is "+" needs parentheses, because `1 + 2 * 3` would parse differently.
If the statuses were fetched for only changed (`hg status`) or ignored ('hg status --ignored`) files, a queried file may not be returned in the response.
If the touch target is the sibling item, the negotiation should only propagate to first common ancestor of current responder and sibling (so the parent).
If you wish to maintain the existing data you must handle merging of old and new data separately and then pass that into this function as the `dataBlob`.
In order to bound the height of a ScrollView, either set the height of the view directly (discouraged) or make sure all parent views have bounded height.
In streams that never have any data, and do push(null) right away, the consumer can miss the 'end' event if they do some I/O before consuming the stream.
It is possible to parse multiple files into a single AST by passing the tree produced by parsing the first file as `program` option in subsequent parses.
Lines count as hidden when they are part of a visual line that starts with another line, or when they are entirely covered by collapsed, non-widget span.
Note that the stack will be restored to its original state after the callback is finished, so it is probably a mistake to retain a reference to the path.
Returns null if the operation fails for whatever reason, including invalid input (e.g. if you pass a filePath that does not exist at the given revision).
SCROLLING THINGS INTO VIEW If an editor sits on the top or bottom of the window, partially scrolled out of view, this ensures that the cursor is visible.
Saves all JS modules of an app as single files The startup code (prelude, polyfills etc.) are written to the file designated by the `bundleOuput` option.
Since console.log support string format as first parameter, we should preserve this behavior by concating eventInfo with first parameter if it is string.
The layout does not reflect the element as seen by the user, rather it reflects the position within the layout system, before any transforms are applied.
The textarea is kept positioned near the cursor to prevent the fact that it'll be scrolled into view on input from scrolling our fake cursor out of view.
The toolbar makes an effort to keep track of which BuckProject to act on, based on the last TextEditor that had focus that corresponded to a BuckProject.
These APIs used to exist on classic React classes but since we would like to deprecate them, we're not going to move them over to this modern base class.
This is necessary in case native updates the text and JS decides that the update should be ignored and we should stick with the value that we have in JS.
This view contains the ConnectionDetailsForm on the left side, and a NuclideListSelector on the right side that displays 0 or more connection 'profiles'.
This works well thanks to a neat trick defined on the sourcemap spec that makes use of of the `sections` field to combine sourcemaps by adding an offset.
We generally only want to see the flags for 'compile' commands, since they'll usually be the same for all other commands (barring an unexpected restart).
`isLoop` marks a keyword as starting a loop, which is important to know when parsing a label, in order to allow or disallow continue jumps to that label.
adler32 is not cryptographically strong, and is only used to sanity check that markup generated on the server matches the markup generated on the client.
if a file contains errors or warnings we don't want to store the file in the cache so we can guarantee that next execution will also operate on this file
@return If the directory is part of a Mercurial repository, returns an object with the following field: originURL The string URL of the repository origin.
A path URI is either a local path, such as: /aaa/bb/ccc or remote nuclide://sandbox.com/aaa/bb/ccc - The URIs can point either to files or to directories.
According to the spec for indexed source maps, they have the following attributes:  - version: Which version of the source map spec this map is following.
An instance can either be created by calling the constructor which accepts multiple options and the configuration, or by calling a `createChild()` method.
Below is a wrapper around a local object that implements the RemoteObject interface, which can be used by the UI code (primarily ObjectPropertiesSection).
CI environment can be quite slow and we can't guarantee that it can consistently motice a file change so we change the file every few seconds just in case
For style(name, function) or style(name, function, priority), evaluate the function for each element, and set or remove the style property as appropriate.
Handles merging the results of the mutation/subscription into the store, updating each top-level field in the data according the fetched fields/fragments.
If Flow, when running in this root, has reported errors for this file, this invalidation is not necessary because the path will be explicitly invalidated.
If a `render` callback is not supplied, the default behavior is to render the container if data is available, the existing view if one exists, or nothing.
If currentContents is null, it means that the file has not changed since it has been saved, so we can avoid piping the whole contents to the Flow process.
If no file (or directory) at the specified path exists, creates the parent directories (if necessary) and then writes an empty file at the specified path.
If so, it sets this.charLength to the byte length that character, and sets this.charReceived to the number of bytes that are available for this character.
Note that this combined with `maxNumToRender` and the number of rows that can fit in one screen will determine how many rows to render above the viewport.
Regardless, whoever is the responder after any potential transfer, we direct all touch start/move/ends to them in the form of `onResponderMove/Start/End`.
Select the parent of the selection if the following criteria are met: Only 1 node is selected The node is not a root The node is not an expanded directory
Sort the auto-completions based on a scoring function considering: case sensitivity, position in the completion, private functions and alphabetical order.
Takes in all the various params on the function in the docblock or inline comments and converts them into the format the annotator transform is expecting.
The Flow type does not capture this, but the first message always has a path, and the diagnostics package requires a FileDiagnosticMessage to have a path.
The `.action()` callback is invoked when the command `name` is specified via __ARGV__, and the remaining arguments are applied to the function for access.
There are two situations when this happens, when a garbage timer ID was given and when a previously existing timer was deleted before this callback fired.
This function assumes that the nuclide server has been started in insecure mode, e.g. with using the integration-test-helpers.startNuclideServer function.
This is a bug, filed against Atom Linter here: https://github.com/AtomLinter/Linter/issues/150 TODO(jjiaa): remove this hack when the Atom issue is closed
This is a controlled component that requires an `onValueChange` callback that updates the `value` prop in order for the component to reflect user actions.
This is weird because we want to remove the module but not it's node_modules folder allowing for this allows us to not worry about the order of operations
This suffices in most situations outside of unit tests, since interface conformance is checked whenever new instances are created using builder functions.
Thus, an array of style objects (instances of StyleSheet.create), are individually resolved to, their respective objects, merged as one and then returned.
Vue and every constructor that extends Vue has an associated options object, which can be accessed during compilation steps as `this.constructor.options`.
We need the full set, including inner nodes, because the unmemoize step might remove the first node (and so the real first node needs to be in the array).
Will perform a transition between touchable states, and identify any highlighting or unhighlighting that must be performed for this particular transition.
`AppRegistry` should be `require`d early in the `require` sequence to make sure the JS execution environment is setup before other modules are `require`d.
file: has the file or directory name, stats: has the stats of the file/dir, isSymbolicLink: true if the entry is a symlink to another filesystem location.
if we're doing read(0) to trigger a readable event, but we already have a bunch of data in the buffer, then just trigger the 'readable' event and move on.
this function is used to determine wether a squarebracket or a curlybracket expression is a comprehension array, destructuring assignment or a json value.
we should find the directory based on the directory the script is running in and it should match the layout in a build tree where npm is installed in ....
Adding the filename to the processed hashmap so the reporting is not affected (showing a warning about .eslintignore being used when it is not really used)
Cache used to avoid operating on files that haven't changed since the last successful execution (e.g., file passed linting with no errors and no warnings).
Executes visitor on the object and its children, but only traverses into children which can be statically analyzed and don't depend on runtime information.
Given a `prevElement` and `nextElement`, determines if the existing instance should be updated as opposed to being destroyed or replaced by a new instance.
Handles responses to an ajax request: - finds the right dataType (mediates between content-type and expected dataType) - returns the corresponding response
However, also add individual async events to the thread flow (above), so we can easily display them on the same chart as other events, should we choose so.
If property `borderless` evaluates to true the ripple will render outside of the view bounds (see native actionbar buttons as an example of that behavior).
If the datatip was moved, push the effects of mouseUp to the next tick, in order to allow cancelation of captured events (e.g. clicks on child components).
If this is already a prerelease, it will bump to the next version drop any prereleases that might already exist, since they are not relevant at this point.
It is analagous to `RelayQueryTransform` with the main differences as follows: - there is no `state` (which allowed for passing data up and down the tree).
It is not sufficient to assign `setImmediate` to `requestFlush` because `setImmediate` must be called *by name* and therefore must be wrapped in a closure.
It works by rendering a subset of rows and replacing offscreen rows with an empty spacer, which means that it has to re-render rows when scrolling back up.
Move contents from the temporary directory If the contents are a single directory (and we're not preserving structure), move its contents directly instead.
Otherwise we need to figure it out if the user really wants to remove it, even with dependants As such we need to prompt the user with a meaningful message
Otherwise, returns all mappings corresponding to the given line and either the column we are searching for or the next closest column that has any offsets.
Plugins might want to do this, so that they can use event dispatching as a tool that helps them decide which events should be extracted in the first place.
Since the parent is rendered in the list above the children, it doesn't really make sense to highlight it if you are below the start position of any child.
Since this is being run in a browser and the results should populate to an HTML page, require the HTML-specific Jasmine code, injecting the same reference.
Something like `1.2.3 - 1.2.4` Note that these all use the loose form, because they'll be checked against either the strict or loose comparator form later.
StringDecoder provides an interface for efficiently splitting a series of buffers into a series of JS strings without breaking apart multi-byte characters.
The Clang server receives requests serially via stdin (and processes them in that order) so it's quite safe to assume that requests are processed in order.
The status update stream will be completed when a root is disposed, so there is no need to use takeUntil here to truncate the stream and release resources.
They aren't valid JSON but nothing actually enforces that we are getting valid JSON and we are using a full JS parser so we have to handle cases like this.
This file installs the logic that modifies Node's built in require() function to transpile .js files that start with either `'use babel'` or `"use babel"`.
This is a crude lookahead trick to try and notice that we're parsing the argument patterns for a fat-arrow function before we actually hit the arrow token.
This is the case when event.relatedTarget is null (no element is being focused) and document.activeElement is reset to default (this is not a window blur).
Use a PromisePool if you have a sequence of async operations that need to be run in parallel and you also want control the number of concurrent executions.
User clicked on a new directory or the user isn't using the "Preview Tabs" feature of the `tabs` package, so don't toggle the node's state any further yet.
Wait using `setTimeout` and not `process.nextTick` or `setImmediate` because those queue tasks in the current and next turn of the event loop respectively.
We can't hang onto stmtPath outside of this function, because it's just a reference to a mutable FastPath object, so we have to go ahead and print it here.
always update the store to ensure the value is present in the appropriate data sink (record/queuedRecords), but only record an update if the value changed.
fnparam means that this identifier is being defined as a function argument (see identifier()) prop means that this identifier is that of an object property
if the file dependencies have change we need to invalidate the dependencies caches because the list of files we need to send to the client may have changed
note that the first line in the comment is not a valid exception block pattern because of the minus sign at the end of the line: `//*********************-`
("Apple") nor the names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.
(We try 3 times because because Rx 3 and 4 have bugs with retrying shared observables that would give false negatives for this test if we only tried twice.)
- They should be avoided, and/or eventually be replaced with another abstraction that allows event plugins to perform multiple "rounds" of event extraction.
- characters: all characters, - words: first letter of each word - sentences: first letter of each sentence (default) - none: don't auto capitalize anything
All of the following functions must throw an AssertionError when a corresponding condition is not met, with a message that may be undefined if not provided.
All the native tags are negative numbers, to avoid collisions, but in the JS we keep track of them as positive integers to store them effectively in Arrays.
Custom and pre-defined easing functions, delays, durations, decay factors, spring constants, and more can all be tweaked depending on the type of animation.
Each unique combination of filter calls is stored in its own generated record (ex: `field.orderby(x)` results are separate from `field.orderby(y)` results).
Every time a StatusBar component is mounted, we push it's prop to a stack and always update the native status bar with the props from the top of then stack.
For example, you may want to think about your `Animated.Value` as going from 0 to 1, but animate the position from 150px to 0px and the opacity from 0 to 1.
If there's more than one initial capital letter, lower-case all but the last one, so that XMLDefaultDeclaration (for example) becomes xmlDefaultDeclaration.
In this example, a component receives data in chunks, handled by `_onDataArrived`, which concats the new data onto the old data and updates the data source.
Note that due to our own strict renaming rules, this must be a private method instead of a static function becuase of the access to _menuOptions and _items.
Note that the inverse - attempt to resolve based on fragment plurarity - doesn't work because there's no way convert plural ids to singular w/o losing data.
Note that, unlike in the Writer case, ProxyReader is going to be the *normal* state of affairs, since we rarely know the type of a file prior to reading it.
Provide linkingActionMap to instruct the container to subscribe to linking events, and use this mapper to convert URIs into actions that your app can handle
Remove root from the result (last node in the array) and put it at the bottom of the stack so that it is visited after all orphan nodes and their subgraphs.
So, we cache the output of runCommandInNewPane function and use the same instance of runCommandInNewPane to re-open output pane for the same server process.
Source is preserved since cloneElement is unlikely to be targeted by a transpiler, and the original source is probably a better indicator of the true owner.
Takes in all the various params on the function in the docblock or inline comments and converts them into the format the bodyWrapper transform is expecting.
The padding-right forces the element to have a 'border', which is needed on Webkit to be able to get line-level bounding rectangles for it (in measureChar).
This makes the loop below, which gathers the positions of all the characters on the line, do an amount of layout work quadratic to the number of characters.
This may only occur in the main thread and is the responsibility of ReactEventListener, which is injected and can therefore support pluggable event sources.
Unfortunately, when the temp files in these tests are opened in the editor, editor.getPath() returns the original file path with '/private/' appended to it.
We do a require here instead of just importing at the top of the file because the describe block below needs to mock things, and has to use uncachedRequire.
Writing to the final column wraps the line We have to use stdout here, because Node's magic SIGWINCH handler only updates process.stdout, not process.stderr
`propValue` being instance of, say, date/regexp, pass the 'object' check, but we can offer a more precise error message here rather than 'of type `object`'.
always update the store to ensure the value is present in the appropriate data sink (records/queuedRecords), but only record an update if the value changed.
entry: - module_id: NUL terminated utf8 string - module_offset: uint_32 offset into the module string - module_length: uint_32 length in bytes of the module
here we known the file or directory doesn't exist, so we will try to infer if its a directory if it looks like a directory for the current operating system.
(Explicit aliases are only needed within a single component when it uses the same field multiple times, in order to differentiate these fields in the props).
@param newTab is actually a ProviderSpec plus the `name` and `tabContent` properties added by _renderTabs(), which created the tab object in the first place.
Admittedly, this is a little gross, but it seems better than setting style.width on every item that we create and having to give it a special flexbox layout.
All ScrollView-like components should implement this method so that they can be composed while providing access to the underlying scroll responder's methods.
Although setImmediate yields to the browser's renderer, it would be preferrable to falling back to setTimeout since it does not have the minimum 4ms penalty.
Attempt to create an observer instance for a value, returns the new observer if successfully observed, or the existing observer if the value already has one.
Even if we find the node we're looking for, we finish looping through its siblings to ensure they're cached so that we don't have to revisit this node again.
Fetch it from the repository Note that the promise is stored in the decomposed endpoint because it might be reused if a similar endpoint needs to be resolved
For readline-type situations This much at the start of a line being redrawn after a ctrl char is seen (such as backspace) won't be redrawn as the replacement
If a palm is accidentally counted as a touch, but a finger is moving greatly, the palm will move slightly, but we only want to count the single moving touch.
If the jsbundle is running from a sideload location, this resolves assets relative to its location E.g. 'file:///sdcard/AwesomeModule/drawable-mdpi/icon.png'
If you need to override any of this functions do so by defining the file `rn-cli.config.js` on the root of your project with the functions you need to tweak.
It is necessary for this to be called during the wathcer's dependency collection phase because we want the v-for to update when the source Object is mutated.
Most providers will include a set of grammarScopes, and will therefore get notifications only about TextEditors that are associated with those grammarScopes.
Proper implementation of methods exposed on Symbol.prototype They won't be accessible on produced symbol instances as they derive from HiddenSymbol.prototype
Sometimes it's called a "filter", but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.
Specifically, a context menu item would often like to know which file (or directory) the user right-clicked on in the file tree when selecting the menu item.
The Windows implementation of `fs.access` has a bug where it will sometimes return access errors all the time for directories, even when access is available.
The base implementation of `baseForIn` and `baseForOwn` which iterates over `object` properties returned by `keysFunc` invoking `iteratee` for each property.
The returned `trackedNode` is never tracked directly: instead it serves as an indicator to `diffConnection` that the entire connection field must be tracked.
The user is either in another app or on the home screen - `inactive` - This is a transition state that currently never happens for typical React Native apps.
There is no modified character for this key combination and no character is inserted into the document, but FF fires the keypress for char code `100` anyway.
Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.
When called from a file in a spec/ directory that has a subdirectory named fixtures/, it copies the specified subdirectory of fixtures into a temp directory.
When customizing `templateSettings`, if you don't want to define an interpolation, evaluation or escaping regex, we need one that is guaranteed not to match.
When true, gestures can drive zoom past min/max and the zoom will animate to the min/max value at gesture end, otherwise the zoom will not exceed the limits.
`setTimeout` does not call the passed callback if the delay is less than approximately 7 in web workers in Firefox 8 through 18, and sometimes not even then.
because optimistic payloads may not contain all fields, we loop over the data that is present and then have to recurse the query to find the matching fields.
rs_signFunc-based RequestSigners have to build up their entire signing string within the rs_lines array and give it to rs_signFunc as a single concat'd blob.
since some of them *might* be directories, we have to run the match in dir-mode as well, so that we'll pick up partials of files that will be included later.
start from the root object and mark as non-extraneous all modules that haven't been previously flagged as extraneous then propagate to all their dependencies
there's a lot of state associated with an "install" operation, including packages that are already installed, parent packages, current shrinkwrap, and so on.
Avoid duplicate anchor links If we are at an h3, go through the previous element siblings of this node, and find its h2 parent and append it to the href text.
Depending on the location of .arcconfig, we may get a key that is different from what `arc lint` actually returns, and end up without any lints for this path.
For a reason I have yet to figure out, some browsers disallow word wrapping between certain characters *only* if a new inline element is started between them.
Gets the connectionIDs for all the connections that contain the given record as a `node`, or null if the record does not appear as a `node` in any connection.
If performUpdateIfNecessary happens to enqueue any new updates, we shouldn't execute the callbacks until the next render happens, so stash the callbacks first
If there are too many breakpoints in a storage, it is likely due to a recent bug that caused periodical breakpoints duplication leading to inspector slowness.
Initially false to indicate the cell should be rendered "offscreen" with position: absolute so that incremental rendering doesn't cause things to jump around.
Jasmine has trouble spying on properties supplied by getters, so to make it work we have to get the value, delete the getter, and set the value as a property.
Negotiation should bubble as deep as the target is because we don't find first common ancestor (with current responder) because there is no current responder.
Note that it is very inefficient to transfer large quantities of binary data between JS and native code, so you should avoid calling this more than necessary.
Of course, it'll still fail eventually if it's a true cycle, and leave things in an undefined state, but that's what is to be expected when `--force` is used.
On some browsers, horizontal scrolling will cause redraws to happen before the gutter has been realigned, causing it to wriggle around in a most unseemly way.
Prior to Atom v1.7.0, `atom.inSpecMode` had a chance of performing an IPC call that could be expensive depending on how much work the other process was doing.
Results should be cached keyed by the query with values of null meaning "being fetched" and anything besides null and undefined as the result of a valid query
Since there is no prevalidation step for ES6 classes, there is no hook for us to issue a warning earlier than element creation when the error actually occurs.
The title and subtitle are expanded so the logo and navigation icons are displayed on the left, title and subtitle in the middle and the actions on the right.
This implementation reuses the `Touch` objects themselves as the `Event`s since we dispatch an event for each touch (though that might not be spec compliant).
This top level compile function would normally be called on instance root nodes, but can also be used for partial compilation if the partial argument is true.
Transports bindings 1) key is the dataType 2) the catchall symbol "*" can be used 3) selection will start with transport dataType and THEN go to "*" if needed
V8 is reusing the same scriptId for multiple eval() calls and DevTools front-end does not update the displayed source code when a content of a script changes.
We must optimistically mark mod as initialized before running the factory to keep any require cycles inside the factory from causing an infinite require loop.
We recommend creating one `RelayEnvironment` instance per user: client apps may share a single instance, server apps may create one instance per HTTP request.
We want to get rid of owner and replace string `ref`s with arrow functions, and as long as `this` and owner are the same, there will be no change in behavior.
a root call with a ref param that references another query)  Additionally ensures that any requisite sibling fields are embedded in each layer of the wrapper.
didRecalcStyle handles style invalidations that occur before the recalc style event but we need to handle style recalc invalidations during recalc style here.
if the 'project' config is not a filename, and we're not in global mode, then that means that it collided with either the default or effective userland config
normalize hosted-git-info clone URLs back into regular URLs this will only work on URLs that hosted-git-info recognizes https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/7961
v8 provided a way to customize Error stacktrace generation by overwriting Error.prepareStackTrace (https://code.google.com/p/v8/wiki/JavaScriptStackTraceApi).
--- Welcome to debugging React --- This error was thrown as a convenience so that you can use this stack to find the callsite that caused this warning to fire.
At first glance, one might be inclined to use the traditional formula to translate binary numbers between the positive and negative values in two's complement.
Convert TemplateLiteral into a single template string with substitution names, a matching array of substituted values, and a set of substituted variable names.
Except when testing an event plugin or React's event handling code specifically, you probably want to use ReactTestUtils.Simulate to dispatch synthetic events.
Export 'ko' in the binding context so it will be available in bindings and templates even if 'ko' isn't exported as a global, such as when using an AMD loader.
FIXME: This file is included into both apps, since the devtools_app needs the InspectorFrontendHostAPI only, so the host instance should not initialized there.
For now, if a user requests the flags for a path outside of a Buck project, such as /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/..., then return null.
If a pre-compiled linker is available, that means the passed in element will be pre-transcluded and compiled as well - all we need to do is to call the linker.
If so, then if the two path lengths are equal OR if the next character in the path to check is a path separator, then we know the checked path is in this path.
If this node needs parentheses and will not be wrapped with parentheses when reprinted, then return false to skip reprinting and let it be printed generically.
Instead of calling _addInvalidationToEvent directly, we create synthetic StyleRecalcInvalidationTracking events which will be added in _addInvalidationToEvent.
It works by creating a new constructor that has the same prototype as the original constructor, and simply applies the original constructor directly to 'this'.
Keep the original open editor item with a unique name until the remote buffer is loaded, Then, we are ready to replace it with the remote tab in the same pane.
Map from full process name to binary that starts the process We can't just re-use full process name, because it will spawn a new instance of the app every time
Pass a string as options.sourceFileName to recast.parse to tell the reprinter to keep track of reused code so that it can construct a source map automatically.
TODO(mbolin): Find a way to unregister the autocomplete provider from ServiceHub, or set a boolean in the autocomplete provider to always return empty results.
The `view` argument can be the literal string `window` if you want to capture the entire window, or it can be a reference to a specific React Native component.
The document is represented as a BTree consisting of leaves, with chunk of lines in them, and branches, with up to ten leaves or other branch nodes below them.
The picker will conform to whatever width is given, but we do have to set the component's height explicitly on the surrounding view to ensure it gets rendered.
These two empty containers will cause all calls to ActionId.SOMETHING or MarkerId.OTHER to equal 'undefined', unless they are given a concrete value elsewhere.
This is something of an integration test: we dig into the internals a little bit in our Session class so this test ensures we won't be surprised if it changes.
This method assumes the pathSet should be populated with file paths that are *RELATIVE* to the localDirectory passed into PathSetUpdater::startUpdatingPathSet.
Visitor methods return false to indicate that they have handled their own traversal needs, and we should not complain if this.needToCallTraverse is still true.
WINDOW-WIDE EVENTS These must be handled carefully, because naively registering a handler for each editor will cause the editors to never be garbage collected.
We choose a length that should be long enough to uniquely identify a ChangeSet with an Hg repo, while also being compact enough to display efficiently in a UI.
We may want to extend this logic for similar errors in top-level render calls, so I'm abstracting it away into a function to minimize refactoring in the future
When running a test where a Promise is expected to fail, it is important to verify that it failed in the expected way to avoid false positives in test results.
When true, the scroll view bounces when it reaches the end of the content if the content is larger then the scroll view along the axis of the scroll direction.
`function (option, optstr, arg)` parser that takes a string argument and returns an instance of the appropriate type, or throws an error if the arg is invalid.
paths less than 100 chars don't need a prefix and paths longer than 255 need an extended header and will fail on old implementations no matter what we do here.
we should find the directory based on the directory the script is running in and it should match the layout in an installed tree where npm is installed in ....
- These deferred dispatches are accumulated/collected before they are returned, but processed at a later time by the `EventPluginHub` (hence the name deferred).
A `ListViewDataSource` is created with functions for extracting data from the input blob, and comparing elements (with default implementations for convenience).
Also clear any immediate-child comment nodes, as these wouldn't have been found by node.getElementsByTagName("*") in cleanNode() (comment nodes aren't elements)
Checks that the parent is a direct descendent of an potential implied eval CallExpression, and if the parent is a CallExpression, that we're the first argument.
Creates a query for each of the component's fragments using the given variables, and fragment pointers that can be used to resolve the results of those queries.
Custom attributes won't be added by React because "webview" isn't a valid custom element name (custom elements need a dash), so we set the attributes ourselves.
General spherical polygon clipping algorithm: takes a polygon, cuts it into visible line segments and rejoins the segments by interpolating along the clip edge.
If RemoteDirectoryProvider is called before this, and it failed to provide a RemoteDirectory for a given URI, Atom will create a generic Directory to wrap that.
If concat is successful, we'll remove the segment at segmentIndex + 1 from the orderedSegments after all elements has been added to the segment at segmentIndex.
In the following example, the nested title and body text will inherit the `fontFamily` from `styles.baseText`, but the title provides its own additional styles.
Maps clang's cursor types to the actual declaration types: for a full list see https://github.com/llvm-mirror/clang/blob/master/include/clang/Basic/DeclNodes.td
NOTE ** The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch hits two overlapping views.
Note that `mapData.length` should be computed on each iteration to support iterating over new items in the map that were added after the start of the iteration.
Optionally restricts the set of canceled notifications to those notifications whose `userInfo` fields match the corresponding fields in the `userInfo` argument.
Set template dir to the empty directory so that user templates are not run This environment variable is not multiple config aware but it's not documented anyway
Since multiple touches cannot move the same target to different locations concurrently without tearing the fabric of spacetime, we allow the first touch to win.
So if the treshold is set to 100 and a timer fires 150 ms later than it was scheduled because the event loop was tied up, that would be considered a 50ms stall.
Stores callbacks keyed on grammar and event, to allow for easy retrieval when we need to dispatch to all callbacks registered for a given (grammar, event) pair.
Suppresses events (blur/focus) that could be inadvertently dispatched due to high level DOM manipulations (like temporarily removing a text input from the DOM).
Surround the expression in with statements to inject our command line API so that the window object properties still take more precedent than our API functions.
The following regular expressions will be used to split an object-literal string into tokens These two match strings, either with double quotes or single quotes
The keys are expected to be directory paths (terminated by a separator) and the values are the number of times this directory path has been 'added' to this Map.
To show and hide the registered view inside the side bar, dispatch the named event via `atom.commands.dispatch(atom.views.get(atom.workspace), 'command-name')`.
Unfortunately, due to historical reasons, the `state` has been exposed as public members of the navigator, therefore we'd keep private state as private members.
When we're responding to the checkedValue changing, and the element is currently checked, replace the old elem value with the new elem value in the model array.
exported async module functions //// nextTick implementation with browser-compatible fallback //// capture the global reference to guard against fakeTimer mocks
make a complete bare mirror of the remote repo NOTE: npm uses a blank template directory to prevent weird inconsistencies https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/5867
start the next in the queue if the last step wasn't forced timers currently will call their complete callbacks, which will dequeue but only if they were gotoEnd
- If a view shouldn't "remain" the responder, any active touches should by default be considered "dead" and do not influence future negotiations or bubble paths.
@internal  Constructs query fragments that are sent with mutations, which should ensure that any records changed as a result of mutations are brought up-to-date.
Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.
For options that shouldn't be deep extended: you can add your own custom options here if and when you create one that shouldn't be deep extended (see ajaxExtend)
Formatting code below assumes that parameters are all wrappers whereas frontend console API allows passing arbitrary values as messages (strings, numbers, etc.).
Images are stored in memory and must be manually removed when you are finished with them, otherwise they will continue to use up RAM until the app is terminated.
In the process of returning their deferred-dispatched events, event plugins themselves can dispatch events on-demand without returning them from `extractEvents`.
Invalid URI: it may generate lot of bad errors, like 'TypeError: Cannot call method `indexOf` of undefined' in CookieJar Detect and reject it as soon as possible
It is recommended not to cache the result of this function in case the user updates his or her preferences in Atom, in which case the return value will be stale.
It updates the version in podspec/json/gradle files and makes sure they are consistent between each other After changing the files it makes a commit and tags it.
Object whose keys are rule names and values are arrays of valid ruleConfig items which should be linted against the target source code to determine error counts.
RFC6265 S4.1.2.2 If a cookie has both the Max-Age and the Expires attribute, the Max-Age attribute has precedence and controls the expiration date of the cookie.
Remove generic event handler if we removed something and no more handlers exist (avoids potential for endless recursion during removal of special event handlers)
Setting any of the properties (except for the aforementioned links to parent and siblings) will create a new instance of the class, with required properties set.
Similar to FastPath.prototype.each, except that the results of the callback function invocations are stored in an array and returned at the end of the iteration.
These configurations are used to generate the query for the mutation to be sent to the server and to correctly write the server's response into the client store.
This gesture is to an overswiped region or does not have enough velocity to complete If we are currently mid-transition, then this gesture was a pending gesture.
Use the fastest means possible to execute a task in its own turn, with priority over other events including IO, animation, reflow, and redraw events in browsers.
Workaround for IE6 bug: It won't reliably apply values to SELECT nodes during the same execution thread right after you've changed the set of OPTION nodes on it.
Workers don't share same V8 heap now so there is no need to complicate stuff with the context id like we do to discriminate between scripts from different pages.
inlined Object.is polyfill to avoid requiring consumers ship their own https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is
try/catch here because in case of any error, Atom stops dispatching events to the rest of the listeners, which can stop the remote editing from being functional.
Ensures that variables representing built-in properties of the Global Object, and any globals declared by special block comments, are present in the global scope.
If the user dismissed the dialog, the Promise will still be resolved with action being `DatePickerAndroid.dismissedAction` and all the other keys being undefined.
If the user dismissed the dialog, the Promise will still be resolved with action being `TimePickerAndroid.dismissedAction` and all the other keys being undefined.
If this was the last package in the cache, delete the parent folder (source) For extra security, check against the file system if this was really the last package
It implements the same interface as GitRepository, (https://atom.io/docs/api/latest/GitRepository) in addition to providing asynchronous methods for some getters.
It's possible that node is newly-created (not parsed by Esprima), in which case it probably won't have a .loc property (or an .original property for that matter).
Note that required fields may be missing if the fragment was not fetched with `Relay.Store.primeCache` or `Relay.Store.forceFetch` before creating a subscription.
See type `MutationConfig` and the `buildFragmentForEdgeInsertion`, `buildFragmentForEdgeDeletion` and `buildFragmentForFields` methods above for possible configs.
So, the heuristic here is to compare against the previous version, not the just-committed one, while the revisions timeline would give a way to specify otherwise.
Specifically, if it decides to set node.loc to null, indicating that the node's .loc information is unreliable, then we don't want to add node to the resultArray.
Specifies whether you want to iterate over the mappings sorted by the generated file's line/column order or the original's source/line/column order, respectively.
The initialization sequence occurs as follows: - the constructor is called - onStatus is called to hook up event handlers - initial breakpoints may be added here.
This technique is intended for KO's internal use only and shouldn't be documented or used by application code, as it's likely to change in a future version of KO.
Use of this method is a temporary fix (more like optmization) until something better comes along, since it was removed from specification and supported only in FF
Usually the current owner is the offender, but if it accepts children as a property, it may be the creator of the child that's responsible for assigning it a key.
We can exploit this fact by caching the parsed variable length fields of each segment, allowing us to avoid a second parse if we encounter the same segment again.
http://norbertlindenberg.com/2012/05/ecmascript-supplementary-characters/ and: https://github.com/mathiasbynens/String.fromCodePoint/blob/master /fromcodepoint.js
(This includes properties that mutate due to external factors.) mutationMethod: If non-null, used instead of the property or `setAttribute()` after initial render.
(Though it doesn't quite work for the most negative value) Mainly: - invert all the bits - add one to the result  Of course, this doesn't quite work in Javascript.
By exploiting arrays returning `undefined` for an undefined index, we can rely exclusively on `insertBefore(node, null)` instead of also using `appendChild(node)`.
Check that `component`'s owner is still alive and that `component` is still the current ref because we do not want to detach the ref if another component stole it.
If the messages are from the same file (`filePath` is equal and `localeCompare` returns 0), compare the line numbers within the file to determine their sort order.
Invoked when the component is about to update due to a transition from `this.props`, `this.state` and `this.context` to `nextProps`, `nextState` and `nextContext`.
Matches a regular expression (text enclosed by slashes), but will also match sets of divisions as a regular expression (this is handled by the parsing loop below).
Mixers should implement this to visually distinguish the `VisualRect` so that the user knows that releasing a touch will result in a "selection" (analog to click).
Note that `Animated` is designed to be fully serializable so that animations can be run in a high performance way, independent of the normal JavaScript event loop.
Props passed as properties to a route object will set the configuration for that route's navigation bar, overriding any props passed to the NavigatorIOS component.
Serializes the method arguments to args and argTypes arrays to send the metadata about the argument types with the data to help the server understand and parse it.
Sets `end`, `val`, and maintains `context` and `exprAllowed`, and skips the space after the token, so that the next one's `start` will point at the right position.
TODO: We need to have a solid concept of an "active project" that's consistent across Nuclide (i.e. where we should look for commands like this) and use that here.
The only seemingly possible way to avoid erroring is to access a property that typically works for non-anonymous divs and catch any error that may otherwise arise.
The trailing space is needed to prevent the trailing backslash that is part of the build dir flags (CFLAGS_BD_XXX) from being seen as a line continuation character
These decisions, particularly to marginalize MessageChannel and to capture the MutationObserver implementation in a closure, were integrated back into ASAP proper.
This is used by the `RelayQueryTransform` subclass to implement mapping and filtering behavior, but purely-visitor subclases do not need to follow this convention.
This isn't a perfect solution, since it can still leave diagnostics up in other files, but this is a corner case and doing this is still better than doing nothing.
To "stop" an application when a view should be destroyed, call `AppRegistry.unmountApplicationComponentAtRootTag` with the tag that was pass into `runApplication`.
We calculate the window dimensions in JS so that we don't encounter loss of precision in transferring the dimensions (which could be non-integers) over the bridge.
When `true`, this component does not wrap its children in a scrolling container and instead provides a simple container with visible (the default in CSS) overflow.
if the path of the editor is not null AND is part of the currently selected root that would be removed AND is not part of any other open root, then close the file.
we require this at runtime due to load-order issues, because recursive requires fail if you replace the exports object, and we do, not in deps, but in a dep of it.
@internal  `subtractRelayQuery(minuend, subtrahend)` returns a new query that matches the structure of `minuend`, minus any fields which also occur in `subtrahend`.
@return      Returns SIGN_OK if the data contains a valid signature, SIGN_UNSIGNED if it contains no signature, or SIGN_INVALID if it contains an invalid signature.
Add a rule configuration from the registry to the ruleSets  This is broken out into its own function so that it doesn't need to be created inside of the while loop.
For IE11 issue see: https://connect.microsoft.com/IE/feedbackdetail/view/1928508/ ie11-broken-getters-on-dom-objects https://github.com/medikoo/es6-symbol/issues/12
Helps avoid circular dependencies and allows code to reason about whether or not they are in a Worker, even if they never include the main `ReactWorker` dependency.
However in certain cases, e.g. v-for scope alias and props, we don't want to force conversion because the value may be a nested value under a frozen data structure.
If the update contains messages at a scope that already has messages from this provider in the store, the existing messages will be overwritten by the new messages.
It encodes the source fragment, initial variables, and a mapping from variables in the composing query's (or fragment's) scope to variables in the fragment's scope.
It is recommended that you use an abstraction on top of AsyncStorage instead of AsyncStorage directly for anything more than light usage since it operates globally.
It's attractive to try to do a default serialization but that's probably a bad idea because it could be costly and confusing to serialize a bunch of unneeded stuff.
Note the sensitive matter about accessor property: the property may be physically defined in some proto object, but logically it is bound to the object in question.
Return a memoized function that checks for the existence of a project level .babelrc file, and if it doesn't exist, reads the default RN babelrc file and uses that.
Similar to ES6's rest param (http://ariya.ofilabs.com/2013/03/es6-and-rest-parameter.html) This accumulates the arguments passed into an array, after a given index.
Takes an autocomplete item from Flow and returns a valid autocomplete-plus response, as documented here: https://github.com/atom/autocomplete-plus/wiki/Provider-API
That's a violation of a pretty basic assumption (that the debugger will be paused when your paused event callback is called) so instead we wait until the next tick.
The effect is that once partition is done, the pivot is in the exact place it will be when the array is put in sorted order, and it will not need to be moved again.
This is simpler than registering handlers using emitter events directly, as there's less messy bookkeeping regarding lifetimes of the unregister Disposable objects.
We can't use arrow function here as it will bind `this` to the context of enclosing function which is trackTiming, whereas what needed is context of originalMethod.
When the image is resized, the corners of the size specified by capInsets will stay a fixed size, but the center content and borders of the image will be stretched.
Within a range, each contiguous group of edges is modeled using a `GraphQLSegment`, but this is an implementation detail that `GraphQLRange` hides from its callers.
we want to guarantee directive updates to be called before user watchers so that when user watchers are triggered, the DOM would have already been in updated state.
Called without a callback, because this interface should neither block nor error (by contrast with randomBytes which will throw an exception without enough entropy).
Create valid rule configurations by combining two arrays, with each array containing multiple objects each with a single property/value pair and matching properties.
Each error or warning can consist of any number of different messages from Flow to help explain the problem and point to different locations that may be of interest.
Ensure that every element either is passed in a static location, in an array with an explicit keys property defined, or in an object literal with valid key property.
For example if we were to mount a function at _/admin_, it would be invoked on _/admin_, and _/admin/settings_, however it would not be invoked for _/_, or _/posts_.
For snapshot builders, this option will attempt to enable everything and you can then build everything, ignoring fatal errors within a module by running "nmake snap"
Handles the payload for a node deletion mutation, reading the ID of the node to delete from the payload based on the config and then deleting references to the node.
However, a parsing error does not throw an error from this method - it's just considered a fatal error message, a problem that ESLint identified just like any other.
However, for example sometimes the output may contain escape sequences (e.g. ANSI) that you want to interpret and strip from the data before appending to the buffer.
In this case the two fetched `node` queries do not reflect the fact that `friends.first(3)` were fetched for item `4`, so `friends.first(3)` has to be tracked as-is.
Note that as of Knockout 1.3, we only support jQuery.tmpl 1.0.0pre and later, which KO internally refers to as version "2", so older versions are no longer detected.
Once we require timeouts to be specified, we can remove the boolean flags (appear etc.) and just accept a number or a bool for the timeout flags (appearTimeout etc.)
Plural fragments require the prop value to be an array of fragment pointers, which are merged into a single fragment pointer to pass to the query resolver `resolve`.
Returns the 2D cross product of AB and AC vectors, i.e., the z-component of the 3D cross product in a quadrant I Cartesian coordinate system (+x is right, +y is up).
SELECTION UPDATES The 'scroll' parameter given to many of these indicated whether the new cursor position should be scrolled into view after modifying the selection.
That makes it easy to ignore the optional parameters, since they will be selected along with the last non-optional parameter and you can just type to overwrite them.
The variable mapping is represented by `variableMapping`, a dictionary that maps from names of variables in the parent scope to variables that exist in the fragment.
There is a small chance that the add/remove of the Repository could happen so quickly that the entry for the repo in _subscriptionForRepository has not been set yet.
There may be an unlock assigned to this node, if there is no entry for this "owner", create one inline and set the unlock as though an owner entry had always existed
This next line isn't necessary in a proper browser environment, but jsdom doesn't uncheck the others in a group (which makes this whole test a little less effective)
Used to truncate the text with an ellipsis after computing the text layout, including line wrapping, such that the total number of lines does not exceed this number.
We want to delete these instead, because those directories aren't valid/useful if they are not true RemoteDirectory objects (connected to a real real remote folder).
We're using the "flipnegate" flag here, which tells minimatch to set the "negate" for our information, but still report whether the core pattern was a hit or a miss.
When aggressive is false (typically set to true for forced single-line indents), empty lines are not indented, and places where the mode returns Pass are left alone.
Workaround for IE9 rendering bug - it doesn't reliably display all the text in dynamically-added select boxes unless you force it to re-render by updating the width.
might have slightly different bytes, since the standard isn't very strict, but should have the same semantics checkSum will be different, but cksumValid will be true
nativeEvent is represented as a plain object here to ease testing, because KeyboardEvent's 'charCode' event key cannot be deleted to simulate a missing charCode key.
we fork here depending on the platform: while android is pretty good at loading individual assets, ios has a large overhead when reading hundreds pf assets from disk
@return a RunCommandFunctionAndCleanup, which has the fields: - runCommandInNewPane: The function which can be used to create a new pane with the output of a process.
Emptying firstChildren/findComponentRootReusableArray is not necessary for correctness, but it helps the GC reclaim any nodes that were left at the end of the search.
For example, Atom provides Workspace::onDidChangeActivePaneItem, but we may want to know not when the active pane item has changed, buth when it has stopped changing.
For most nodes, the generic "store" DataID can be used for both reading out of the store and writing into the result object that will be passed back to the component.
If a view model is actually stored in an observable, the corresponding binding context object, and any child contexts, must be updated when the view model is changed.
If the newly selected build system is the one we were waiting to restore from the user's previous session (or we have no active build system), make it the active one.
If we happened to read() exactly the remaining amount in the buffer, and the EOF has been seen at this point, then make sure that we emit 'end' on the very next tick.
Returns a new Babel Transformer that uses the supplied schema to transform template strings tagged with `Relay.QL` into an internal representation of GraphQL queries.
Specifies whether to return the closest element that is smaller than or greater than the one we are searching for, respectively, if the exact element cannot be found.
The marshaller will be called to transform the type before sending it out onto the network, while the unmarshaller will be called on values incoming from the network.
This file contains utilities for getting an expression to specify a certain revision in Hg (i.e. something that can be passed to the '--rev' option of an Hg command).
This function exhibits some of the quirky behavior of Node APIs that accept a variable number of arguments in the middle of the parameter list rather than at the end.
This is to eliminate the need for template loading/saving logic to be duplicated in every template engine (and means they can all work with anonymous templates, etc.)
This loses some information about the filesystem, but creates tarballs that are supported by more versions of tar, especially old non-spec-compliant copies of gnutar.
This relative positioning is to work around the issue that `position: 'head'` doesn't work for overlay decorators are rendered on the bottom right of the given range.
To make sure we actually installed the local version of react-native, we will create a temp file inside the template and check that it exists after `react-native init
We also implement a workaround for non-visible tags disappearing into thin air on IE8, this only happens if there is no visible text in-front of the non-visible tags.
We deserialize them as regular TextBuffers since at this point in the Atom lifecycle, there is no remote connection that can be associated with the NuclideTextBuffer.
bower short-origin             generic message bower very-very-long-origin-string          generic message bower short-origin                          generic message
branches and tags are both symbolic labels that can be attached to different commits, so resolve the commit-ish to the current actual treeish the label corresponds to
can only change the link path by clobbering For hard links, let's just assume that's always the case, since there's no good way to read them if we don't already know.
jQuery.Event is based on DOM3 Events as specified by the ECMAScript Language Binding http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-DOM-Level-3-Events-20030331/ecma-script-binding.html
signalLater looks whether there are any handlers, and schedules them to be executed when the last operation ends, or, if no operation is active, when a timeout fires.
since the file passed we store the result here TODO: check this as we might not need to store the successful runs as it will always should be 0 errors and 0 warnings.
A function can be passed as `onComment` option, which will cause Acorn to call that function with `(block, text, start, end)` parameters whenever a comment is skipped.
Adds an Atom notification for the detected heartbeat network status The function makes sure not to add many notifications for the same event and prioritize new events.
At this point, the binding context has been initialized, and the "subscribable" computed observable is subscribed to any observables that were accessed in the process.
Can't do this because several apps including ASP.NET trace the stack via arguments.caller.callee and Firefox dies if you try to trace through "use strict" call chains.
For connections with range calls on them the "store" and "component" ID will be different because the component needs a special client-ID that encodes the range calls.
For example, these files would all be related: `Foo.h`, `Foo.m`, `FooInternal.h`, `Foo-inl.h`  For now, we only search in the given path's directory for related files.
HTTP and HTTPS:  If you run your application both as HTTP and HTTPS you may wrap them individually, since your Connect "server" is really just a JavaScript `Function`.
If the consequent is an IfStatement, check to see if it has an else and both its consequent and alternate path return, meaning this is a nested case of rule violation.
If the side bar became visible or if it was already visible and the active view changed, call the next active view's `onDidShow` so it can respond to becoming visible.
If this turns out to be a popular use case it's possible to implement by overiding `Object.freeze` to store a "hash" property on the object for later use with the map.
If we found a closing parenthesis but it occurred after the end of the original subtree for this reprinting, then we must not return true for hasClosingParen(oldPath).
In addition to normal JavaScript comments (// and /*) this method also recognizes JSHint- and JSLint-specific comments such as /*jshint, /*jslint, /*globals and so on.
Note: resolvedEnd is undefined when the original sequence's length is unknown and this slice did not supply an end and should contain all elements after resolvedBegin.
React warnings use console.error so that a stack trace is shown, but we don't (currently) want these to show a redbox (Note: Logic duplicated in ExceptionsManager.js.)
React warnings use console.error so that a stack trace is shown, but we don't (currently) want these to show a redbox (Note: Logic duplicated in polyfills/console.js.)
Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.
Since we update `_renderedChildren` and the actual DOM at (slightly) different times, we could race here and see a newer `_renderedChildren` than the DOM nodes we see.
The "nextTick" phase of an entering transition, which is to be pushed into a queue and executed after a reflow so that removing the class can trigger a CSS transition.
The following permissions are supported:  - `alert` - `badge` - `sound`  If a map is provided to the method, only the permissions with truthy values will be requested.
The most important side effect is the `touchableHandlePress` abstract method invocation that occurs when a responder is released while in either of the "Press" states.
Then if a code path exits by a control statement (such as `break`, `continue`) from the `finally` block, the destination's segments may be half of the source segments.
This along with iOS quirks, justifies restricting top-level listeners to the document object only, at least for these movement types of events and possibly all events.
This function takes in a file path, and computes all directories that would be considered a parent of it, i.e., the file path is contained by all of these directories.
This is not desirable (it's hard for a developer to realise a chain of dependencies might cause this, and they almost certainly didn't intend infinite re-evaluations).
This means that it is extremely difficult to have them upgrade the version and because there's only one global version installed, it is very prone to breaking changes.
Verify that RCTSnapshot is part of the UIManager since it is only loaded if you have linked against RCTTest like in tests, otherwise we will have a warning printed out
We keep track of the last colon that we see (i.e. the colon that is closest to the beginning of the document) and terminate once we've reached the start of the method.
When merged lines are present, we might have to reduce the intact ranges because changes in continued fragments of the intact lines do require the lines to be redrawn.
With the way `ReactNativeEventEmitter` dispatches touches as individual events, multiple touches generate two 'move' events, each of them triggering `onResponderMove`.
pretending to be another platform is too hacky, since it breaks how the underlying system looks up module paths and runs child processes, and all that stuff is cached.
Disable any kind of automatic timeout behavior for incoming requests in case it takes the packager more than the default timeout of 120 seconds to respond to a request.
For each input link, a path is computed that travels through the tree, up the parent hierarchy to the least common ancestor, and then back down to the destination node.
However, due to a change in Node 0.10.27+, pseudoRandomBytes is now the same as randomBytes, and may in fact block in situations where insufficent entropy is available.
However, since this timer gets frequently dropped in Firefox workers, we enlist an interval handle that will try to fire an event 20 times per second until it succeeds.
However, we still want to treat ErrorUtils as a module so that other modules that use it aren't just using a global variable, so simply export the global variable here.
I'm leaving the condition here because it used to happen before the switch to JSON and I'd rather log something than have the user experience regress in case I'm wrong.
Ideally we should return such id that it remains same as long as the the debugger process has the same content of scripts and that changes when a new content is loaded.
If any pending queries were subtracted, they will be added as dependencies and the query will only resolve once the subtracted query and all dependencies have resolved.
In addition to the data for the given event it also sends a event control object which allows the listeners/handlers to prevent the default behavior of the given event.
Other kinds of exceptions will propagate without being intercepted and rethrown by a catch block, so their stacks will accurately reflect the original throwing context.
Specialized method for creating RelayGraphQLMutation instances that takes a `files` object in addition to the base `mutation`, `variables` and `environment` parameters.
The PromiseQueue that holds all of these requests is returned by this function, along with a shutdown() function that should be used to disconnect from the UNIX socket.
We could use Nuclide's own babel-core (even babel 6), but we want the exact babel Atom would use in a stock setup- to be able to fallback to Atom transpiling if needed.
When an event has just come in that is likely to add or change something in the input textarea, we poll faster, to ensure that the change appears on the screen quickly.
Workaround for https://github.com/SteveSanderson/knockout/issues/122 IE doesn't fire "change" events on textboxes if the user selects a value from its autocomplete list
`onStartShouldSetResponder` is used when the next move/end will trigger some UI movement/action, but when you want to yield priority to views nested inside of the view.
custom types to the AST type system (in particular, the File type), but those types are now incorporated into ast-types, so this module doesn't have much to do anymore.
hide this from Flow since we can't define these properties outside of __DEV__ without actually implementing them (setting them to undefined isn't allowed by ReactClass)
the point at which write() starts returning false Note: 0 is a valid value, means that we always return false if the entire buffer is not flushed immediately on write()
@internal  Coordinates execution of concurrent mutations, including application and rollback of optimistic payloads and enqueueing mutations with the same collision key.
All DOM nodes support `getAttributeNode` but this can also get called on other objects so just return '' if we're given something other than a DOM node (such as window).
Callers can extract the individual errors contained in this object, but may also just treat it as a normal single error, in which case a summary message will be printed.
Checkout `Animated.Value.addListener` as a way to work around some of these limitations, but use it sparingly since it might have performance implications in the future.
Do not use path.join() because we assume that the remote machine is *nix, so we always want to use `/` as the path separator for cwd, even if Atom is running on Windows.
For those browsers, prevent a loss of focus when changing tabs/windows by setting a flag that prevents hasfocus from calling 'blur()' on the element when it loses focus.
If the found-year flag is not set and the date-token matches the year production, set the found-year flag and set the year-value to the number denoted by the date-token.
If the function accesses any obsevables (or is itself an observable), the dependency is tracked, and those observables can later cause the binding context to be updated.
In a well balanced tree, half of the nodes are in the bottom row and have no children - let's avoid calling out to the native bridge for a large portion of the children.
Magic theory: IE8 supposedly differentiates between added and updated nodes when processing innerHTML, innerHTML on updated nodes suffers from worse whitespace behavior.
Obj-C selector with multiple arguments, e.g. doFoo:withBar: This implementation uses a simple greedy heuristic to find the location of the different parts of a selector.
Operators typeof and delete do not raise runtime errors even if the base object of a reference is null so no need to display warning if we're inside of typeof or delete.
Optionally pass in `true` as `onlyCompareGenerated` to consider two mappings with the same original source/line/column, but different generated line and column the same.
That means, no client new feature shall be enabled before the dependent server serice is in place, while it is OK to add a new server service before the client is ready.
index is given such that source.slice(0, index) is the precise  string that occurs before the cursor, and source.slice(index) is the string that occurs after the cursor.
meant to be used with a filter method on an array or observable stream true if challenge should be passed through false if should filter challenge out of array or stream
stringify(value, options) or stringify(value, replacer, space)  where: value - anything options - object replacer - function or array space - boolean or number or string
Although we could make up a name or generate an anonymous source map, instead we assume that any consumer who does not provide a name does not actually want a source map.
An error thrown from an event will not interrupt, nor even substantially slow down the processing of other events, but will be rather postponed to a lower priority event.
If this function is called multiple times in parallel, the later calls will cause the previous promises to reject even if they end up expanding the node key successfully.
In the future we might support more complicated things, including nested locations ("the bottom of the right") and event different container types (pane items vs panels).
Ordinarily we would have to provide an element or register a view, but since we are just testing the model here and not actually rendering anything Atom doesn't complain.
Possible future optimization: If we know it's an element from an XHTML document (not HTML), we don't need to do the .toLowerCase() as it will always be lower case anyway.
Starting with version 2.0, this file "boots" Jasmine, performing all of the necessary initialization before executing the loaded environment and all of a project's specs.
The _revealAndSelectNode() method might find a different element if there is inlined text, and the select() call would change the selectedDOMNode and reenter this setter.
This allows the ordering to be decoupled from injection of the actual plugins so that ordering is always deterministic regardless of packaging, on-the-fly injection, etc.
string rather than NuclideUri because this module will always execute at the location of the file, so it will always be a real path and cannot be prefixed with nuclide://
A network is classified as metered when the user is sensitive to heavy data usage on that connection due to monetary costs, data limitations or battery/performance issues.
But we would rather have false positives (ignore some user-generated events that occur near a Mercurial event) than false negatives (register irrelevant Mercurial events).
Creates an object in which to store rule configs and error counts  Unless a rulesConfig is provided at construction, the registry will not contain any rules, only methods.
For a single-select box, compare the current value to the previous value But if nothing was selected before or nothing is selected now, just look for a change in selection
Hence, we need to retry fetching the revision info (depending on the common ancestor) because the watchman-based Mercurial updates doesn't consider or wait while rebasing.
If both nodes are subtypes of Expression, then we should be able to fill the location occupied by the old node with code printed for the new node with no ill consequences.
If we found an opening parenthesis but it occurred before the start of the original subtree for this reprinting, then we must not return true for hasOpeningParen(oldPath).
If you provide a source map that was generated from a previous call to recast.print as options.inputSourceMap, the old source map will be composed with the new source map.
NOTE: This function is performance critical, as it can be run on every statement that generates an async event (like addEventListener) to support asynchronous call stacks.
Non-matching fragment types are similar to requisite fields: they don't need to be diffed against and should only be included if something *else* is missing from the node.
Page info comes from the range metadata, so we do a custom traversal here which is simpler than passing through page-info-related state as a hint for the normal traversal.
Perf optimization: when conf does not change the derived fields will be passed along with the options it's not type-safe, but it's way more efficient than recalculate them
Props provide configurability for several features, such as auto-correction, auto-capitalization, placeholder text, and different keyboard types, such as a numeric keypad.
This is called with the following parameters: - `itemValue`: the `value` prop of the item that was selected - `itemPosition`: the index of the selected item in this picker
This will be searched for a '_ko_property_writers' property in case you're writing to a non-observable key:                 The key identifying the property to be written.
We have to create an invariant function that is a lie because using invariant() with an instanceof check is the only way to convince Flow of the type of an unbound `this`.
We have to suppress default finish emitting, because ordinarily it would happen as soon as `end` is called on us and all of the data has been written to our target stream.
We may want to make this configurable, but if it is ever higher than one we need to make sure it works properly when the user manually activates it (e.g. with ctrl+space).
Yes, this will be wrong 1/1000 times on platforms with subsecond stat precision, but that's acceptable in exchange for not mistakenly removing locks on most other systems.
CONTEXT MENU HANDLING To make the context menu work, we need to briefly unhide the textarea (making it as unobtrusive as possible) to let the right-click take effect on it.
Delegate focus to the FileTree component if this component gains focus because the FileTree matches the selectors targeted by themes to show the containing panel has focus.
Here we use asap to wait until all updates have propagated, which is important when using controlled components within layers: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/1698
If the found-month flag is not set and the date-token matches the month production, set the found-month flag and set the month-value to the month denoted by the date-token.
In general native animated implementation should support any numeric property that doesn't need to be updated through the shadow view hierarchy (all non-layout properties).
Keep in mind that ScrollViews must have a bounded height in order to work, since they contain unbounded-height children into a bounded container (via a scroll interaction).
NB: Taken straight from: https://github.com/IvanVergiliev/2048-react/blob/master/src/board.js with no modification except to format it for CommonJS and fix lint/flow errors
Save / Rewrite / Restore  When rewriting paths found in an expression, it is possible for the same letter sequences to be found in strings and Object literal property keys.
Set the `rules` of a config by examining a user's source code  Note: This clones the config object and returns a new config to avoid mutating the original config parameter.
Subscribable provides a mixin for safely subscribing a component to an eventEmitter  This will be replaced with the observe interface that will be coming soon to React Core
The Inspector uses TreeOutlines to represents object properties, so recursive expansion in some case can be infinite, since JavaScript objects can hold circular references.
The mode given as the base argument takes care of most of the normal mode functionality, but a second (typically simple) mode is used, which can override the style of text.
The reason we want to know the amount a wheel event will scroll is that it gives us a chance to update the display before the actual scrolling happens, reducing flickering.
There are two additional methods for controlling the traversal:  - `traverse(parent, state)`: Returns a cloned copy of the parent node after processing all of its children.
This allows us to provide an API that is similar to CSS, where transforms may be applied in an arbitrary order, and yet have a universal, singular interface to native code.
This plugin is also responsible for emitting `composition` events, thus allowing us to share composition fallback code for both `beforeInput` and `composition` event types.
Wrap the data in an object, because if `data` is a primitive data type, finding it in an array would return the first matching item, not necessarily the same inserted item.
(2) For writable targets (observables, or writable dependent observables), we throttle *writes* so the target cannot change value synchronously or faster than a certain rate
(For old IE.) Starts tracking propertychange events on the passed-in element and override the value property so that we can distinguish user events from value changes in JS.
@see http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2010/09/click_event_del.html  Also, `keyup`/`keypress`/`keydown` do not bubble to the window on IE, but they bubble to document.
Adds an option 'styleSelectedText' which, when enabled, gives selected text the CSS class given as option value, or "CodeMirror-selectedtext" when the value is not a string.
Available options: - keepArchive: true to keep the archive afterwards (defaults to false) - keepStructure: true to keep the extracted structure unchanged (defaults to false)
Combines the result of computing the existing spans with the set of spans that existed in the history (so that deleting around a span and then undoing brings back the span).
Instead, we must take all recently moved touches, and calculate how the centroid has changed just for those recently moved touches, and append that change to an accumulator.
Make sure that nothing sneaks out Record all 3 overflow attributes because IE9-10 do not change the overflow attribute when overflowX and overflowY are set to the same value
NavigationFindReducer takes an array of reducers, and returns a reducer that iterates through all of the reducers and the result of the first reducer that modifies the input
Nodes have their start and end characters offsets recorded in `start` and `end` properties (directly on the node, rather than the `loc` object, which holds line/column data.
Position does not expose methods for construction via an `HTMLDOMElement`, because it isn't meaningful to construct such a thing without first defining a frame of reference.
Returns the first function passed as an argument to the second, allowing you to adjust arguments, run code before and after, and conditionally execute the original function.
TODO(mbolin): Make it so that when mousing over an element with this CSS class (or specifically, the child element with the "region" CSS class), we also do a showPopupFor().
The catch here is that IE's selection API doesn't provide information about whether the selection is forward or backward, so we have to behave as though it's always forward.
The node being currently traversed can be obtained by calling .traversedNode() .next() returns a promise that is fulfilled when the traversal moves on to the next directory.
We simply start parsing an expression, and afterwards, if the next token is a colon and the expression was a simple Identifier node, we switch to interpreting it as a label.
console.error("Hardlink detected, switching mode", self._path, self.linkpath) Setting __proto__ would arguably be the "correct" approach here, but that just seems too wrong.
Although parentheses wouldn't hurt around sequence expressions in the head of for loops, traditional style dictates that e.g. i++, j++ should not be wrapped with parentheses.
Calling atom.project.repositoryForDirectory gets the real path of the directory, which is another round-trip and calls the repository providers to get an existing repository.
Destroys the entire sub-stack, rather than just using last(impliedEvalAncestorsStack).pop(), as a CallExpression is always the bottom of a impliedEvalAncestorsStack substack.
Esprima used to use the .name field to refer to the local binding identifier for ImportSpecifier nodes, but .id for ImportNamespaceSpecifier and ImportDefaultSpecifier nodes.
Fool around closure compiler -- it has its own notion of both KeyboardEvent constructor and initKeyboardEvent methods and overriding these in externs.js does not have effect.
If the React component was previously rendered into `container`, this will perform an update on it and only mutate the DOM as necessary to reflect the latest React component.
If the node is an export declaration and its .declaration has any decorators, their locations might contribute to the true start/end positions of the export declaration node.
If we don't reject, then we might leak promises if a node key is expanded and collapsed in succession (the collapse could succeed first, causing the expand to never resolve).
It isn't possible to produce an "empty" ref query dependency with `Relay.QL`, but in order to be future-proof against this possible edge case, we create such a query by hand.
The nodes have different types, and at least one of the types is not a subtype of the Expression type, so we cannot safely assume the nodes are syntactically interchangeable.
This "route" is the mount-point for the middleware, when given a value other than _/_ the middleware is only effective when that segment is present in the request's pathname.
This has the drawbacks of 1) adding an event listener even when we don't have a callback for it and 2) needing to add explicit support for each event type we want to support.
This is a simple utility that allows us to reason about a collection of items, but handling the case when there is exactly one item (and we do not need to allocate an array).
This is one of "functions", "arrowFunctions", "generatorFunctions", "asyncFunctions", "methods", "generatorMethods", "asyncMethods", "getters", "setters", and "constructors".
This timeout sets the amount of time to wait *between* bytes sent from the server, and may or may not correspond to the wall-clock time elapsed from the start of the request.
Traverses an input query, updating the passed in `SplitQueries` state object to contain a nested structure representing the required and deferred portions of the input query.
Unlike other browsers, IE doesn't change the checked state of checkboxes/radiobuttons when you trigger their "click" event so to make it consistent, we'll do it manually here
We decided to go with this for now since it's fairly understandable behavior for the end-user and easy to "correct" (by dragging and dropping) if it's not the desired result.
We want to observe changes in the saved connection profiles during the lifetime of this connection dialog, because the user can add/delete a profile from a connection dialog.
``AS IS'' AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.
if there's more than one match, we just ignore this kind of loop otherwise I'm going to be writing a full JavaScript lexer...and god knows I've got better things to be doing.
- While touches are still occurring, the responder lock can be transferred to a new view, but only to increasingly "higher" views (meaning ancestors of the current responder).
Could be publishing a URL or tarball, however, that means that we will not have automatically run the prepublish script, since that gets run when adding a folder to the cache.
End Of Line If an EOL is not preceded by a backslash, show a warning and proceed like it was a legit multi-line string where author simply forgot to escape the newline symbol.
General infra (such as `ReactMultiChild`) reasons opaquely about the data, but platform specific code (such as `ReactNativeBaseComponent`) can make assumptions about the data.
If a subsequent touch move exceeds the boundary of the element, it should unhighlight, but if that same touch is brought back within the boundary, it should rehighlight again.
If there has been existing heartbeat error/warning, that means connection has been lost and we shall show a message about connection being restored without a reconnect prompt.
Iterate over all defined fields of an object, including those missing or undefined, passing each field name and effective value (as returned by getFieldValue) to the callback.
Like scryRenderedDOMComponentsWithTag but expects there to be one result, and returns that one result, or throws exception if there is any other number of matches besides one.
TODO figure out how to allow the diagnostic consumer to poll (for example, if it was just activated and wants diagnostic messages without having to wait for an event to occur)
Takes a method from Node's fs module and returns a "denodeified" equivalent, i.e., an adapter with the same functionality, but returns a Promise rather than taking a callback.
The DOM events that CodeMirror handles can be overridden by registering a (non-DOM) handler on the editor for the event name, and preventDefault-ing the event in that handler.
The package expects icons to have a `data-name` attribute with the name of the file and for the list item in the tree to have the class names 'entry', 'file', and 'list-item'.
This context will automatically populate the "sourceEvent" and "target" attributes of the event, as well as setting the `d3.event` global for the duration of the notification.
Yes, it is deeply ugly to write APIs this way, but that still doesn't mean that the Readable class should behave improperly, as streams are designed to be sync/async agnostic.
(All keys from `EventConstants.topLevelTypes`)  Note: Top level event types are a subset of the entire set of handler types (which include a broader set of "synthetic" events).
(This property can be omitted if there are no args.)  Note that both the args for the remote method, as well as the return type of the remote method, must be JSON-serializable.
Add some extra space past the right boundary as the rightmost divider label text may be partially shown rather than just pop up when a new rightmost divider gets into the view.
After the promise returned by debug() is resolved, call sendCommand() to send Chrome Commands, and be prepared to receive notifications via the server notifications observable.
All even indices of this array are one line of the generated code, while all odd indices are the newlines between two adjacent lines (since `REGEX_NEWLINE` captures its match).
Distributed under an MIT license: http://codemirror.net/LICENSE This is CodeMirror (http://codemirror.net), a code editor implemented in JavaScript on top of the browser's DOM.
Parse the mappings in a string in to a data structure which we can easily query (the ordered arrays in the `this.__generatedMappings` and `this.__originalMappings` properties).
Removes spans entirely within the change, reconnects spans belonging to the same marker that appear on both sides of the change, and cuts off spans partially within the change.
Replace any instances already present with a re-opening code otherwise only the part of the string until said closing code will be colored, and the rest will simply be 'plain'.

There's a race condition if we try to navigate to the specified example from the initial props at the same time the navigation logic is setting up the initial navigation state.
When we move forward in the navigation stack, we perform a right-to-center transition on the new navigation item and a center-to-left transition on the current navigation item.
a flag to know if we're processing previously buffered items, which may call the _write() callback in the same tick, so that we don't end up in an overlapped onwrite situation.
we have to do this here, because couchdb will only ever say "bad password" with a 401 when you try to PUT a _users record that the validate_doc_update rejects for *any* reason.
--------------------- Available options: - mode: force final mode of dst (defaults to null) - copyMode: copy mode of src to dst, only if mode is not specified (defaults to true)
As efficiently as possible, decorate the comment object with .precedingNode, .enclosingNode, and/or .followingNode properties, at least one of which is guaranteed to be defined.
Calls to ContextMenu.addItem() and ContextMenu.addSubmenu() on the same turn of the event loop batch up their internal _sort() calls to run at the end of the current event loop.
Disabling a package during the traversal has no effect if this is a startup load because `PackageManager` does not re-load the list of packages to activate after each iteration.
Fix https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues/292 When navigating Atom workspace with `CMD/CTRL` down, it triggers TextEditorElement's `mousemove` with invalid screen position.
However, since this is not, and has never been, a public API (_ko_property_writers was never documented), it's acceptable as an internal implementation detail in the short term.
I don't fully understand the motivation behind separating it out, but prepending it with 'See also: ' and adding it to the end of the messages is what the Flow team recommended.
If the user (while pressing) moves back into the `PressRect` `touchableHandleActivePressIn` will be invoked again and the mixer should probably highlight the `VisualRect` again.
If your React component's render function is "pure", e.g. it will render the same result given the same props and state, provide this mixin for a considerable performance boost.
It always refers to the navigation context the event handler has been attached to as opposed to event.target which identifies the navigation context on which the event occurred.
Like scryRenderedDOMComponentsWithClass but expects there to be one result, and returns that one result, or throws exception if there is any other number of matches besides one.
React Native in dev mode often starts with Red Box "Can't fibd variable __fbBatchedBridge..." This is fixed by clicking Reload JS which will trigger a request to packager server
Same as `scryRenderedComponentsWithType` but expects there to be one result and returns that one result, or throws exception if there is any other number of matches besides one.
Since `pointerEvents` does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes, we opt to not include `pointerEvents` on `style`.
The `ScrollResponder` is a natural place to put this logic since it can support not dismissing the keyboard while scrolling, unless a recognized "tap"-like gesture has occurred.
This data is hard coded for the sake of the demo, but you could imagine fetching this data from a backend service rather than from hardcoded JSON objects in a more complex demo.
This is not how UNIX pipes work: if the reader closes, the writer needs to also close (otherwise the writer process may hang.) We have to manually close the writer in this case.
This takes a config object with the following properties:  isCustomAttribute: function that given an attribute name will return true if it can be inserted into the DOM verbatim.
objects shorter than 30 characters are always inlined objects longer than 60 characters are always splitted to multiple lines anything in the middle depends on indentation level
on JSC we need to inject from native for sourcemaps to work (Safari doesn't support `sourceMappingURL` nor any variant when evaluating code) but on Chrome we can simply use eval
we just do this repeatedly until there are no more orphaned packages which isn't as effecient as it could be on a REALLY big tree but we'll face that if it proves to be an issue
Also, it provides a relatively simple matcher so that if it thinks that you likely mistyped the event name it will suggest what you might have meant to type in the error message.
Check if the whole file was downloaded In some unstable connections the ACK/FIN packet might be sent in the middle of the download See: https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/6143
Check that the first comment is adjacent to the end of the group, the last comment is adjacent to the candidate property, and that successive comments are adjacent to each other.
Emits an event of the given type with the given data, and holds that event in order to be able to dispatch it to a later subscriber when they say they want to handle held events.
Fat queries can be written like normal GraphQL queries with one main exception: fat queries use childless non-scalar fields to indicate that anything under that field may change.
Get the width of the cell in the first (and only) row of the header table in order to determine the width of the column, since it is not possible to query a column for its width.
If this is not called before calling onNewLayout, the number of inProgress cells will remain non-zero, and thus the onNewLayout call will not fire the needed state change update.
In addition to executing ordinary .js files, the other Node process can also run .js files under the Babel transpiler, so long as they have the `'use babel'` pragma used in Atom.
Many files being changed may be a sign that we are picking up changes that were created in an automated way -- so in addition, there may be many batches of changes in succession.
Optionally pass in `true` as `onlyCompareGenerated` to consider two mappings with the same generated line and column, but different source/name/original line and column the same.
That works great a lot of the time, except that heavy operations like rendering may block the JS thread from responding quickly to events like taps, making the app feel sluggish.
These helpers are all encapsulated into a single module, because they use mutation as a performance optimization which leads to subtle shared dependencies between the code paths.
These tests are set up so that calls to getHackService() will delegate to this function, so make sure to define this function at the start of your test to mock out this behavior.
These will be called for *every* additional finger that move/start/end, dispatched directly to whoever is the current responder at that moment, until the responder is "released".
This can be used to make sure the first task is fully resolved (including asynchronous dependencies that also schedule more tasks via `enqueue`) before starting on the next task.
This is a kludge to keep keymaps mostly working as raw objects (backwards compatibility) while at the same time support features like normalization and multi-stroke key bindings.
We leave it up to Babel to do that automatically and apply the transforms accordingly (which works because we pass in `filename` and `sourceFilename` to Babel when we transform).
(Previously, these function names were misleading because they referred to JSON specifically, even though they actually work with arbitrary JavaScript object literal expressions.)
@public  RelayContainer is a higher order component that provides the ability to:  - Encode data dependencies using query fragments that are parameterized by routes and variables.
At this point, no pattern may contain "/" in it so we're going to return a 2d array, where each entry is the full pattern, split on '/', and then turned into a regular expression.
If the context is reference-equal to the old one, pass down the same processed object so the update bailout in ReactReconciler behaves correctly (and identically in dev and prod).
Normally we'd wrap this in a `span` for the reasons stated above, but since this is a situation where React won't take over (static pages), we can simply return the text as it is.
Reason for this is that `glob` needs `/**` to collect all the files under a directory where as our previous implementation without `glob` simply walked a directory that is passed.
Therefore, we need the third state, firstCoverInitializedNameError, to track the first usage of CoverInitializedName and report it when we reached the end of the parentheses pair.
This test might look like it's just testing ReactMultiChild but the last bug in this was actually in DOMChildrenOperations so this test needs to be in some DOM-specific test file.
Uses a copy-on-write scheme for the positions, to avoid having to reallocate them all on every rebase, but also avoid problems with shared position objects being unsafely updated.
We have to manually update the contents of an existing ConnectionDetailsForm, because it contains AtomInput components (which don't update their contents when their props change).
Where possible, ignore which event was raised and determine focus state using activeElement, as this avoids phantom focus/blur events raised when changing tabs in modern browsers.
- Forward these native events (with the associated top-level type used to trap it) to `EventPluginHub`, which in turn will ask plugins if they want to extract any synthetic events.
A React component for displaying different types of images, including network images, static resources, temporary local images, and images from local disk, such as the camera roll.
A value is considered array-like if it's not a function and has a `value.length` that's an integer greater than or equal to `0` and less than or equal to `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`.
All functionality available through `AlertIOS.alert` is also available in the cross-platform `Alert.alert`, which we recommend you use if you don't need iOS-specific functionality.
Disabling and unloading Atom's bundled 'tree-view' must happen after activation because this package's `activate` is called during an traversal of all initial packages to activate.
FIXME: Improve the Tree Element / Outline Abstraction to prevent crawling the DOM For an expanded element, it will be the last element with class "close" in the child element list.
If, however, the set operation is a no-op (such if setting a property to the same value it already has), new instance creation is not skipped and same instance is returned instead.
New properties applied via up/down or live editing have an _originalPropertyText and will be deleted later on, if cancelled, when the empty string gets applied as their style text.
Remove all items from the registry with a non-zero number of errors  Note: this also removes rule configurations which were not linted (meaning, they have an undefined errorCount).
Temporarily push properties named by string arguments given after the callback function onto this.stack, then call the callback with a reference to this (modified) FastPath object.
The `Transaction` class itself will supply one additional automatic invariant for you - the invariant that any transaction instance should not be run while it is already being run.
The `getLineInfo` function is mostly useful when the `locations` option is off (for performance reasons) and you want to find the line/column position for a given character offset.
The current location can be updated with next/previous which return non-null if the current location has been updated, or null of current is already at the top/bottom of the stack.
This also needs to be changed if minimumPrefixLength goes above 1, since after you type a single alphanumeric character, autocomplete-plus no longer includes the dot in the prefix.
This can happen when the concrete nodes are different but structurally identical, or when the route/variables are different but do not have an effect on the structure of the query.
This implementation (a modified version of the SheetJS version) has been optimized for our use case, at the expense of conforming to the adler32 specification for non-ascii inputs.
This is irrelevant for commands that do etag / last-modified caching, but ls and view also have a timed cache, so this keeps the user from thinking that it didn't work when it did.
This means that we need to proxy up their entry events so that those entries won't be missed, since .pipe() doesn't do anythign special with "child" events, on with "entry" events.
This mixin provides safe versions of InteractionManager start/end methods that ensures `clearInteractionHandle` is always called once per start, even if the component is unmounted.
We are in a node install directory where this script lives in lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/node-gyp/lib or node_modules/npm/node_modules/node-gyp/lib depending on the platform
`beforeInput` is spec'd but not implemented in any browsers, and the `input` event does not provide any useful information about what has actually been added, contrary to the spec.
conversion from interpolation strings with one-time token to expression is differed until directive bind time so that we have access to the actual vm context for one-time bindings.
it's not possible for the same frag to be removed twice, so if we have a pending stagger callback, it means this frag is queued for enter but removed before its transition started.
on ios, there is a delay after touch event and synthetic mouse events, so that user can perform double tap solution: ignore mouse events following touchevent within small timeframe
swappable if display is none or starts with table except "table", "table-cell", or "table-caption" see here for display values: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/display

Delete the reference from the instance to this internal representation which allow the internals to be properly cleaned up even if the user leaks a reference to the public instance.
If a component is unmounted before pending changes apply, it will still be here, but we assume that it has cleared its _pendingCallbacks and that performUpdateIfNecessary is a noop.
If either the owner or a `ref` has changed, make sure the newest owner has stored a reference to `this`, and the previous owner (if different) has forgotten the reference to `this`.
It's not smart to choose a naive heuristic like "log all string arguments" because services such as Flow take the unsaved file contents as an argument, which would clutter our logs.
Must force callback to be called on nextTick, so that we don't emit 'drain' before the write() consumer gets the 'false' return value, and has a chance to attach a 'drain' listener.
Neither the name of Salesforce.com nor the names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.
Override chrome.devtools as a workaround for a error-throwing getter being exposed in extension pages loaded into a non-extension process (only happens for remote client extensions)
Special form of calling `addListener` that *guarantees* that a subscription *must* be tied to a component instance, and therefore will be cleaned up when the component is unmounted.
The presence of `rangeInfo` indicates that we are traversing connection metadata fields, in which case `visitField` will ensure that `edges` and `page_info` are kept when necessary.
This would be easy if we had a single node to watch, but binding contexts can be used by many different nodes, and we cannot assume that those nodes have any relation to each other.
To avoid this, ReactMultiChild calls `prepareToManageChildren` before we change `_renderedChildren`, at which time the container's child nodes are always cached (until it unmounts).
We have to destroy panes themselves, not merely the pane items, in order to trigger the callbacks that ArcanistDiagnosticsProvider registers on atom.workspace.onWillDestroyPaneItem.
lookup for the assignment (esnext only) if it has semicolons, it is a block, so go parse it as a block or it's not a block, but there are assignments, check for undeclared variables
A SourceMapConsumer instance represents a parsed source map which we can query for information about the original file positions by giving it a file position in the generated source.
An initial attempt to mock the clock was unsuccessful, probably because of problems clearing the require cache thoroughly enough that the debounce function picks up the mocked clock.

For a deep node passed such as 'dir1/dir2/foo.txt' each of the intermediate nodes 'dir1', 'dir1/dir2', 'dir1/dir2' and 'dir1/dir2/foo.txt' entries will be present in the returned map
For the base 64 variable length quantities we use in the source map spec, the first bit is the sign, the next four bits are the actual value, and the 6th bit is the continuation bit.
If this directory is "www" and you are trying to check "www-base", just using startsWith would return true, even though "www-base" is at the same level as "Www", not contained in it.
Invoked when the item is "selected" - meaning the interaction ended by letting up while the item was either in the state `RESPONDER_ACTIVE_PRESS_IN` or `RESPONDER_INACTIVE_PRESS_IN`.
NOTE: If there is no other `response` listeners handling of `response` event changes program behavior Without our listener all data will be dumped, but we pause data by our listener.
Skip config scribe_cat logger if 1) running in test environment 2) or running in Atom client 3) or running in open sourced version of nuclide 4) or the scribe_cat command is missing.
The selection changes after keydown and before keyup, but we check on keydown as well in the case of holding down a key, when multiple keydown events are fired but only one keyup is.
The top-level component (defined by a shell) is generally responsible for creating the Store connecting it up to a bridge, and putting it on `context` so the decorator can access it.
This effectively defers execution of previously queued tasks until the promise resolves, at which point we allow the new queue to be popped, which happens once it is fully processed.
To accomplish this, provide route objects to the navigator to identify each scene, and also a `renderScene` function that the navigator can use to render the scene for a given route.
Use fakeSetTimeout, fakeClearTimeout, fakeSetInterval and fakeClearInterval to mock Node.js's Timer utils, and using advanceClock to advance the fake timer to trigger timed callback.
We want to avoid storing pending events if this event was generated by the same buffer as the current editor, to avoid duplicating events when multiple panes have the same file open.
no runBeforeMainModule for hmr bundles `require` calls in the require polyfill itself are not extracted and replaced with numeric module IDs, but the require polyfill needs Systrace.
A workaround before Atom 2.0: Atom's Project::setPaths currently uses ::repositoryForDirectorySync, so we need the repo information to already be available when the new path is added.
Because the value for the Initial Directory that the user supplied may have been a symlink that was resolved by the server, overwrite the original `cwd` value with the resolved value.
Contains internal static internal state in order to test that updates to existing children won't reinitialize components, when moving children - reusing existing DOM/memory resources.
However, the Disposable that it does return removes the subscription on the 'did-reload-all' event (which is supposed to be deprecated) rather than the 'did-change-active-themes' one.
If the cropping process is successful, the resultant cropped image will be stored in the ImageStore, and the URI returned in the success callback will point to the image in the store.
If the point at this leaf node is at the same position as the new point we are adding, we leave the point associated with the internal node while adding the new point to a child node.
If the target is in a managed directory and is in a symlink, but was not in our parent that usually means someone else installed a bin file with the same name as one of our bin files.
Intersection point lies inside of the polygon if scalar products of normal of the plane and cross products of successive tVects are all nonstrictly above or all nonstrictly below zero
Note that we assume that the beforeRemove callback will usually be used to remove the nodes using some sort of animation, which is why we first reorder the nodes that will be removed.
Set a timeout in memory - this block will throw if the server takes more than `timeout` to write the HTTP status and headers (corresponding to the on('response') event on the client).
The initial render is synchronous but any updates that happen during rendering, in componentWillMount or componentDidMount, will be batched according to the current batching strategy.
The touch handling system considers one or more active touches to be an 'interaction' and will delay `runAfterInteractions()` callbacks until all touches have ended or been cancelled.
This function supports circular references by default, but if you are certain there are no circular references in your object, you can save some CPU time by calling clone(obj, false).
This tests that after the install we have a freshly installed version of `bundle-update` (in alignment with the package.json), instead of the version that was bundled with `top-test`.
Watchman returns paths relative to the subscription root, which may be different from (i.e. a parent directory of) the localDirectory passed into PathSetUpdater::startUpdatingPathSet.
rs_signer-based RequestSigners can add a line at a time to their signing state by using rs_signer.update(), thus only needing to buffer the hash function state and one line at a time.
A recursive descent parser operates by defining functions for all syntactic elements, and recursively calling those, each function advancing the input stream and returning an AST node.
All major browsers except Firefox resets selectedIndex with value -1 to 0 when the element is appended to a new parent, therefore we have to force a DOM update whenever that happens...
Containers may be subscribed to "new" records in the case where they were previously garbage collected or where the link was incrementally loaded from cache prior to the linked record.
Finds coordinates of point on layer quad, having offsets (ratioX * width) and (ratioY * height) from the left corner of the initial layer rect, where width and heigth are layer bounds.
For a given reconcile, look at which components did not actually render anything to the DOM and return a mapping of their ID to the amount of time it took to render the entire subtree.
For those developers who rely on _ko_property_writers in their custom bindings, we expose _twoWayBindings as an undocumented feature that makes it relatively easy to upgrade to KO 3.0.
Ideally this would be the only find in here, but it's not because of a jscodeshift bug, so we have to manually search for a specific kind of GenericTypeAnnotations on class super types
If you decide to catch this exception and stop it from propagating, make sure to call its cancel method to avoid silencing other exceptions that might be thrown later in the traversal.
Register as a named AMD module, since jQuery can be concatenated with other files that may use define, but not via a proper concatenation script that understands anonymous AMD modules.
The callback function will be called with `bool supported` as the only argument  NOTE: As of iOS 9, your app needs to provide the `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes` key inside `Info.plist`.
The chunks are rendered sequentially using the `InteractionManager` queue, which means that rendering will pause if it's interrupted by an interaction, such as an animation or gesture.
The vertices used for the traversals are vi+, vi-, vo-, and vo+, where the superscript o means outside and i means inside, the subscript - means left subtree and + means right subtree.
There may be some cases where scroll views actually should return `true` from `onStartShouldSetResponder`: Any time we are detecting a standard tap that gives priority to nested views.
These node references were useful for breaking ties, but we don't need them anymore, and they create cycles in the AST that may lead to infinite recursion if we don't delete them here.
This is responsible for managing (creating/disposing) multiple HackLanguage instances, creating the designated HackService instances with the NuclideClient it needs per remote project.
We can come up with an optimistic estimate, however, by assuming that mappings are contiguous (i.e. given two consecutive mappings, the first mapping ends where the second one starts).
When nothing is selected, the cursor sits after previously seen text (can be empty), which is stored in prevInput (we must not reset the textarea when typing, because that breaks IME).
inherit node position from first neighbor with defined position or if no such neighbors, initialize node position randomly initialize neighbors lazily to avoid overhead when not needed
("Facebook") owns all right, title and interest, including all intellectual property and other proprietary rights, in and to the React Native CustomComponents software (the "Software").
- That input argument should contain a (string) "clientMutationId" property for the purposes of reconciling requests and responses (automatically added by the RelayGraphQLMutation API).
An update here will schedule an update but immediately set _pendingStateQueue which will ensure that any state updates gets immediately reconciled instead of waiting for the next batch.
As such, `GraphQLSegment` offers both a `getCount` method (returning the number of non-deleted edges) and a `getLength` method (which returns the total number, including deleted edges).
Detect hardware back button presses, and programmatically invoke the default back button functionality to exit the app if there are no listeners or if none of the listeners return true.
Extract data from Apple's `aps` dict as defined: https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/Chapters/ApplePushService.html
Going forward, we probably want to special-case some of the paths under /Applications/Xcode.app so that click-to-symbol works in files like Frameworks/UIKit.framework/Headers/UIImage.h.
Helper function that parses an exported function declaration, and returns the function name, along with a FunctionType object that encodes the argument and return types of the function.
If for some reason we lost a lot of frames (e.g. process large payload or stopped in the debugger), we only advance by 4 frames worth of computation and will continue on the next frame.
Naive return checking, does not iterate through the whole BlockStatement because we make the assumption that the ReturnStatement will be the last node in the body of the BlockStatement.
Since e is used in a callback invoked on another event loop (as in setTimeout etc), we need to call e.persist() on the event to make sure it doesn't get reused in the event object pool.
Since we were not able to preserve all leading/trailing comments, we delete oldNode's comments, print newPath with comments, and then patch the resulting lines where oldNode used to be.
TODO: It may be a good idea to cache this to prevent unnecessary DOM traversal, but caching is difficult to do correctly without using a mutation observer to listen for all DOM changes.
They can modify and replace the state parameter that's threaded through the walk, and can opt how and whether to walk their child nodes (by calling their third argument on these nodes).
They will usually fail anyways because `this._renderedComponent` is empty, however, if a component is *reused*, then that won't be the case and things will appear to work in some cases.

"**" a/**/b/**/c would match the following: a/b/x/y/z/c a/x/y/z/b/c a/b/x/b/x/c a/b/c To do this, take the rest of the pattern after the **, and see if it would match the file remainder.
@internal  A map from developer-friendly operation names ("append", "prepend", "remove") to internal book-keeping keys used to store metadata on records ("__rangeOperationAppend__" etc).
For events like 'submit' which don't consistently bubble (which we trap at a lower node than `document`), binding at `document` would cause duplicate events so we don't include them here
Integrate with your platform specific scroll views, or even your custom built (every-frame animating) scroll views so that all of these systems play well with the `ResponderEventPlugin`.
It's important that we build the array of ancestors before calling any event handlers, because event handlers can modify the DOM, leading to inconsistencies with ReactMount's node cache.
Leading comments are defined as:  - let N be the number of leading comments numbered 0 to N-1 - if there is space betwee comment N-1 and first, comments 0 to N-1 - else comments 0 to N-2
One difference between this behavior and W3C spec: cancelled touches will not appear in `.touches`, or in any future `.touches`, though they may still be "actively touching the surface".
TTL() partially replaces the "expiry-time" parts of S5.3 step 3 (setCookie() elsewhere) S5.3 says to give the "latest representable date" for which we use Infinity For "expired" we use 0
The state is encoded in 3 booleans: enabled: is there an enabled connection break: are there any disabled connections in break status running: are there any connections in running status
The visually param controls whether, in right-to-left text, direction 1 means to move towards the next index in the string, or towards the character to the right of the current position.
This test is disabled due to differences in the behavior of Mercurial between v3.3 (where hg grep searches the revision history), and v3.4 (where hg grep) searches the working directory.
This will traverse through all node_modules folders, resolving the dependencies object to the object corresponding to the package that meets that dep, or just the version/range if unmet.
This, combined with our use of diff queries (see `diffRelayQuery`) means that we only go to the server for things that are not in (or not on their way to) the cache (`RelayRecordStore`).
We want to make sure if a listener is attached using jQuery, it is also removed with jQuery, that's why we do the check for each directive instance and store that check result on itself.
is a directory or is a file, but the original file the user provided looks like a directory but `path.resolve` removed the `last path.sep` so we need to still treat this like a directory
A BasicSourceMapConsumer instance represents a parsed source map which we can query for information about the original file positions by giving it a file position in the generated source.
A decorator factory (https://github.com/wycats/javascript-decorators) who measures the execution time of an asynchronous/synchronous function which belongs to either a Class or an Object.
Catching keyup usually gets it and catching keydown lets us fire an event for the first keystroke if user does a key repeat (it'll be a little delayed: right before the second keystroke).
Convert wildcard targets to semver range targets if they are newly Note that this can only be made if they can be targetable If they are not, the resolver is incapable of handling targets
If there is no error attached to loggingEvent.data, we create a new error and append it to loggingEvent.data, so that we could get stack information which helps categorization in logview.
In the case of "break on uncaught exception" triggered by "TypeError: undefined is not a function", the exception is thrown by a V8 builtin CALL_NON_FUNCTION defined in v8/src/runtime.js.
Merges the file change statuses of the dirty filesystem state with the revision changes, where dirty changes and more recent revisions take priority in deciding which status a file is in.
Note that only JSON-compliant objects are currently supported, as there's no provision for traversing prototypes, extracting class names via constructor, handling properties or functions.
Scroll a given position into view (immediately), verifying that it actually became visible (as line heights are accurately measured, the position of something may 'drift' during drawing).
The assignment of fine-grained, information-carrying type objects allows the tokenizer to store the information it has about a token in a way that is very cheap for the parser to look up.
To work around this, we introduce an artificial delay for the watchman updates for our files of interest, which allows time for a wlock watchman update (if any) to arrive and cancel them.
Unfortunately there appears to be a bug in Internet Explorer 10 Mobile (and Desktop to a lesser extent) that renders both setImmediate and MessageChannel useless for the purposes of ASAP.
When records are collected after calls to `scheduleCollection` or `scheduleCollectionFromNode`, records are collected in steps, with a maximum of `stepLength` records traversed in a step.
log.error('System', os.type() + ' ' + os.release()) log.error('command', process.argv.map(JSON.stringify).join(' ')) log.error('node -v', process.version) log.error('npm -v', npm.version)
text/html ignores the first character in these tags if it's a newline Prefer to break application/xml over text/html (for now) by adding a newline specifically to get eaten by the parser.
the false_name-test-package has the name property 'test-package' set in the package.json and a dependency named 'test-package' is also a defined dependency of 'test-package-with-one-dep'.
(The Firstname Lastname may not appear sometimes.) The ChangeSetID will not be the full 40 digit hexadecimal number, but a prefix whose length is determined by CHANGE_SET_ID_PREFIX_LENGTH.
@param test Will be called with each item and must return either: (1) A "thenable" (i.e, a Promise or promise-like object) that resolves to a derived value (that will be returned) or null.
A default connection profile is a combination of the user's last inputs to the connection dialog and the default settings, plus the update logic we use to change the remote server command.
A mouse down can be a single click, double click, triple click, start of selection drag, start of text drag, new cursor (ctrl-click), rectangle drag (alt-drag), or xwin middle-click-paste.
Collapsed markers have unique ids, in order to be able to order them, which is needed for uniquely determining an outer marker when they overlap (they may nest, but not partially overlap).
If we have multiple messages place them under a messages key The first error will be logged as message key This is to adhere to TAP 13 loosely defined specification of having a message key
This may occasionally result in a false positive: cancelling events that were generated by a user action (not Mercurial) that occur shortly before Mercurial modifies the working directory.
Using object.assign() was proven to be less performant than direct named assignment Since in heavy updates, nodes are created by the thousands we need to keep the creation flow performant.
Without this, controlled components don't work properly in conjunction with event bubbling because the component is rerendered and the value reverted before all the event handlers can run.
doing so could cause problems in cases where the `node` executable was compiled on a different machine (with different lib/include paths) than the machine where the addon is being built to
however, in this implementation, it's easier just to do the intuitive thing, and let brace-expansion actually come before parsing any extglob patterns, like the documentation seems to say.
passing an empty string as a 3rd parameter to .css will automatically attempt a parseFloat and fallback to a string if the parse fails so, simple values such as "10px" are parsed to Float.
A lower number yields better accuracy for code that is tracking the scroll position, but can lead to scroll performance problems due to the volume of information being send over the bridge.
A positive number will use setTimeout to schedule any tasks after the eventLoopRunningTime hits the deadline value, otherwise all tasks will be executed in one setImmediate batch (default).
Any data fetched for these children is not written to the client store, but you can add code to process it in the `onSuccess` callback passed to the `RelayEnvironment` `applyUpdate` method.
Batching is necessary here in order to ensure that all event handlers run before the next rerender (including event handlers attached to ancestor elements instead of directly on the input).
Because we are modifying the entries (by converting string sources and names to indices into the sources and names ArraySets), we have to make a copy of the entry or else bad things happen.
If node is something like a window, document, or text node, none of which support attributes or a .getAttribute method, gracefully return the empty string, as if the attribute were missing.
JSNumbers aren't precise enough for this, so time is handled internally as 'msecs' (integer milliseconds) and 'nsecs' (100-nanoseconds offset from msecs) since unix epoch, 1970-01-01 00:00.
Normally we'd wrap this between comment nodes for the reasons stated above, but since this is a situation where React won't take over (static pages), we can simply return the text as it is.
Note: IE10+ supports the Selection object, but it does not support the `extend` method, which means that even in modern IE, it's not possible to programatically create a backward selection.
The URL where the browser client can access the REST API is available Replace with a full url (including hostname) if your client is being served from a different server than your REST API.
This implementation relies on the "phabdiff" template being available as defined in: https://bitbucket.org/facebook/hg-experimental/src/fbf23b3f96bade5986121a7c57d7400585d75f54/phabdiff.py.
non-Chrome browsers, to check whether a string is in a set, a predicate containing a big ugly `switch` statement is faster than a regular expression, and on Chrome the two are about on par.
"The user agent MUST use an algorithm equivalent to the following algorithm to compute the default-path of a cookie:"  Assumption: the path (and not query part or absolute uri) is passed in.
Although the Toolbar supports remote images for the logo, navigation and action icons, this should only be used in DEV mode where `require('./some_icon.png')` translates into a packager URL.
It's common for client code to pass the same options into both recast.parse and recast.print, but the Printer doesn't need (and can be confused by) options.sourceFileName, so we null it out.
Match text (at least two characters) that does not contain any of the above special characters, although some of the special characters are allowed to start it (all but the colon and comma).
Note: IE10+ supports the Selection object, but it does not support the `extend` method, which means that even in modern IE, it's not possible to programmatically create a backward selection.
The checkout process could be similar to the GitRemoteResolver by prepending file:// to the source But from my performance measures, it's faster to copy the folder and just checkout in there
The partitioning chooses a pivot between `p` and `r` and moves all elements that are less than or equal to the pivot to the before it, and all the elements that are greater than it after it.
The symptoms were that if your mouse is not moving over something contained within that mount point (for example on the background) the top-level listeners for `onmousemove` won't be called.
This is based on the protocol description at: https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin/blob/master/doc/dev/PROTOCOL.md https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin/tree/master/src/frontend
This module provides an alternative parser (`parse_dammit`) that exposes that same interface as `parse`, but will try to parse anything as JavaScript, repairing syntax error the best it can.
When the user chooses password-based authentication, we specify the config as follows so that it tries simple password auth and failing that it falls through to the keyboard interactive path
If we call `asap` within tasks scheduled by `asap`, the queue will grow, but to avoid an O(n) walk for every task we execute, we don't shift tasks off the queue after they have been executed.
If we find a child whose ID is an ancestor of the given ID, then we can be sure that we only want to search the subtree rooted at this child, so we can throw out the rest of the search state.
This is fired during the first correctMkdir call, after the stat has finished but before the chownr has finished Buggy old code will fail and return a cached value before initial call is done
Traverse the parent chain of `node` wrapping it at each level until it is either:  - wrapped in a RelayQuery.Root node - wrapped in a non-root node that can be split off in a "ref query" (ie.
When node is a comment, we set node.loc.indent to node.loc.start.column so that, when/if we print the comment by itself, we can strip that much whitespace from the left margin of the comment.
You may also use string shortcuts `"normal"` and `"fast"` which match the underlying iOS settings for `UIScrollViewDecelerationRateNormal` and `UIScrollViewDecelerationRateFast` respectively.
A pending query is resolvable if it is already resolved or will be resolved imminently (i.e. its subtracted query and the subtracted queries of all its pending dependencies have been fetched).
Because Vue's internal modules reference the warn function from different modules (some from util and some from debug), we need to normalize the warn check into a few global utility functions.
Compute a style array (an array starting with a mode generation -- for invalidation -- followed by pairs of end positions and style strings), which is used to highlight the tokens on the line.
Detects any character in the Unicode categories "Uppercase letter (Lu)", "Lowercase letter (Ll)", "Titlecase letter (Lt)", "Modifier letter (Lm)", "Other letter (Lo)", or "Letter number (Nl)".
Hence, if a call is already running, it will wait for it to finish, then start the next async execution, but if called again while not finished, it will return the scheduled execution promise.
In Webkit, preventing default on a spacebar `textInput` event cancels character insertion, but it *also* causes the browser to fall back to its default spacebar behavior of scrolling the page.
In both the case of the `UIWebView` based `RCTJavaScriptCaller` and `RCTContextCaller`, we implement our own custom timing bridge that should be immune to unexplainably dropped timing signals.
It is impossible to create the subscription and pass it in - this method must be the one to create the subscription and therefore can guarantee it is retained in a way that will be cleaned up.
Note that for multiline fields, setting blurOnSubmit to true means that pressing return will blur the field and trigger the onSubmitEditing event instead of inserting a newline into the field.
The "concrete fragment id" uniquely identifies a Relay.QL`fragment ...` within the source code of an application and will remain the same across runs of a particular version of an application.
"Virtual elements" is an abstraction on top of the usual DOM API which understands the notion that comment nodes may be used to represent hierarchy (in addition to the DOM's natural hierarchy).

Decompose a matrix into separate transform values, for use on platforms where applying a precomposed matrix is not possible, and transforms are applied in an inflexible ordering (e.g. Android).
For things the user asked to install, that aren't a dependency (or won't be when we're done), flag it as "depending" on the user themselves, so we don't remove it as a dep that no longer exists
Hack alert, an atom.workspace.open of a location in the current editor, we get the location update before the onDidOpen event, and we don't get an activate/onDidStopChangingActivePaneItem pair.
In the future, it will be possible to load only one set of definitions appropriate for a given parser, but until then we must rely on default functions to reconcile the conflicting AST formats.
MessageChannels are desirable because they give direct access to the HTML task queue, are implemented in Internet Explorer 10, Safari 5.0-1, and Opera 11-12, and in web workers in many engines.
Responder system incorrectly dispatches should* to current responder Filter out any touch moves past the first one - we would have already processed multi-touch geometry during the first event.
TODO: There's room for improvement by using streams if the URL is an archive file, by piping read stream to the zip extractor This will likely increase the complexity of code but might worth it
The `rootNodeID` is sufficient for web `nodeHandle`s, because the position in a tree is always enough to uniquely identify a DOM node (we never have nodes in some bank outside of the document).
`Animated.ValueXY` is handy for 2D animations, like panning, and there are other helpful additions like `setOffset` and `getLayout` to aid with typical interaction patterns, like drag-and-drop.
`minPrec` provides context that allows the function to stop and defer further parser to one of its callers when it encounters an operator that has a lower precedence than the set it is parsing.
this is a generator function in the python lib, which of course is not supported in javascript the reimplementation builds up the grouped opcodes into a list in their entirety and returns that.
when used in node, this will actually load the util module we depend on versus loading the builtin util module as happens otherwise this is a bug in node module loading as far as I am concerned
7.3 If the expected value is a RegExp object, the actual value is equivalent if it is also a RegExp object with the same source and properties (`global`, `multiline`, `lastIndex`, `ignoreCase`).
At this point we couldn't get the IE `uniqueID` to use as a hash and we couldn't use a non-enumerable property to exploit the dontEnum bug so we simply add the `UID_HASH_KEY` on the node itself.
At this point we couldn't get the IE `uniqueID` to use as a hash and we couldn't use a non-enumerable property to exploit the dontEnum bug so we simply add the `hashProperty` on the node itself.
Even though the runtime complexity of this is theoretically worse vs if we used a map, it's much, much faster in practice for the data sets we deal with (we avoid allocating result pair arrays).
Every PathVisitor has a different this.Context constructor and this.Context.prototype object, but those prototypes can all use the same reset, invokeVisitorMethod, and traverse function objects.
Get the value of the field from the first version of the record for which the field is defined, returning `null` if the record has been deleted or `undefined` if the record has not been fetched.
Need to applyBindings *before* unmemoziation, because unmemoization might introduce extra nodes (that we don't want to re-bind) whereas a regular applyBindings won't introduce new memoized nodes
Parse a definition file, returning an intermediate representation that has all of the information required to generate the remote proxy, as well as marshal and unmarshal the data over a network.
TODO(sergeyv): this file is forked from usual es6.js extern baked into closure compiler In original extern Iterator doesn't implement Iterable and as a result you can't iterate over map.values()
When line wrapping is off, we try to improve things by first subdividing the line into a bunch of inline blocks, so that IE can reuse most of the layout information from caches for those blocks.
When piping a LinkReader into a LinkWriter, we have to already have the linkpath property set, so that has to happen *before* the "ready" event, which means we need to override the _stat method.
You can compute the current centroid involving all touches moves after `touchesChangedAfter`, or you can compute the previous centroid of all touches that were moved after `touchesChangedAfter`.

At the moment it only supports having a single View instance as a child node, as it's implemented by replacing that View with another instance of RCTView node with some additional properties set.
Executes a shell command, buffering the stdout and stderr If an error occurs, a meaningful error is generated Returns a promise that gets fulfilled if the command succeeds or rejected if it fails
For some reason, the path returned in tests from GitRepository.getWorkingDirectory is prepended with '/private', which makes the Directory::contains method inaccurate in `repositoryContainsPath`.
If this activation is happening during the normal startup activation, the `onDidActivateInitialPackages` handler below must unload the 'tree-view' because it will have been loaded during startup.
If you want to use a different branch of esprima, or any other module that supports a .parse function, pass that module object to recast.parse as options.parser (legacy synonym: options.esprima).
In order to send minimal queries and avoid re-retrieving data, `RelayPendingQueryTracker` maintains a registry of pending queries, and "subtracts" those from any new queries that callers enqueue.
Object.getOwnPropertyNames is the only way to enumerate non-enumerable properties, so if we wrap it to ignore our secret keys, there should be no way (except guessing) to access those properties.
Since reconciling a component higher in the owner hierarchy usually (not always -- see shouldComponentUpdate()) will reconcile children, reconcile them before their children by sorting the array.
in a node_modules folder, we only include bundled dependencies also, prevent packages in node_modules from being affected by rules set in the containing package, so that bundles don't get busted.
Conveniently, IE8 doesn't support SVG and so we can simply use the attribute in browsers that support SVG and the property in browsers that don't, regardless of whether the element is HTML or SVG.
Each value under the "sections" field has two fields: - offset: The offset into the original specified at which this section begins to apply, defined as an object with a "line" and "column" field.
It falls back to setTimeout on devices that support CSS transitions but not raf (e.g. Android 4.2 browser) - since these environments are usually slow, we are giving it a relatively large timeout.
Most of the functions will simply let the function(s) below them parse, and, *if* the syntactic construct they handle is present, wrap the AST node that the inner parser gave them in another node.
Supported options: timeout (ms), maximumAge (ms), enableHighAccuracy (bool) On Android, this can return almost immediately if the location is cached or request an update, which might take a while.
This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).
`close` is the token type that ends the list, and `allowEmpty` can be turned on to allow subsequent commas with nothing in between them to be parsed as `null` (which is needed for array literals).
handle single-char shorthands glommed together, like npm ls -glp, but only if there is one dash, and only if all of the chars are single-char shorthands, and it's not a match to some other abbrev.
.nud  Null denotation .fud  First null denotation .led  Left denotation lbp  Left binding power rbp  Right binding power They are elements of the parsing method called Top Down Operator Precedence.
Also, if the push() triggered a readable event, and the user called read(largeNumber) such that needReadable was set, then we ought to push more, so that another 'readable' event will be triggered.
By handling mixins before any other properties, we ensure the same chaining order is applied to methods with DEFINE_MANY policy, whether mixins are listed before or after these methods in the spec.
Creates a dispatch context for the specified `thiz` (typically, the target DOM element that received the source event) and `argumentz` (typically, the data `d` and index `i` of the target element).
For no obvious reason, Opera fails to evaluate rewrittenDataBindAttributeValue unless it's wrapped in an additional anonymous function, even though Opera's built-in debugger can evaluate it anyway.
However, it would be good to keep track of files' dev+inode and nlink values, and create a HardLinkReader that emits a linkpath value of the original copy, so that the tar writer can preserve them.
If you don't want to allow that, you can set the property 'allowTemplateRewriting' to false (like ko.nativeTemplateEngine does) and then you don't need to override 'createJavaScriptEvaluatorBlock'.
This is used to auto-alias fields in generated queries, so that developers composing multiple components together don't have to worry about collisions between components requesting the same fields.
remove self from vm's watcher list this is a somewhat expensive operation so we skip it if the vm is being destroyed or is performing a v-for re-render (the watcher list is then filtered by v-for).
A macro that that takes a RNG and performs a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test: asserts that the values generated by the RNG could be generated by the distribution with cumulative distribution function `cdf'.
Any JavaScript/Coffee file within this directory, lib/assets/javascripts, vendor/assets/javascripts, or any plugin's vendor/assets/javascripts directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
AssignmentPattern nodes may appear wherever a Pattern is allowed, and the right-hand side represents a default value to be destructured against the left-hand side, if no value is otherwise provided.
During the lifetime of this 'openConnectionDialog' flow, the 'default' connection profile should not change (even if it is reset by the user connecting to a remote project from another Atom window).
It is however not recommended to use the static API and the component for the same prop because any value set by the static API will get overriden by the one set by the component in the next render.
It takes an offset integer (into the current `input`) to indicate the location of the error, attaches the position to the end of the error message, and then raises a `SyntaxError` with that message.
Make an rs_signer for HMACs, not a rs_signFunc -- HMACs digest their data in chunks rather than requiring it all to be given in one go at the end, so they are more similar to signers than signFuncs.
Opens the remote connection dialog flow, which includes asking the user for connection parameters (e.g. username, server name, etc), and optionally asking for additional (e.g. 2-fac) authentication.
Select is set to empty string on purpose This is to test IE's treatment of not explicitly setting a boolean content attribute, since its presence should be enough http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12359
Since there are only three levels (0, 1, 2) in an implementation that doesn't take explicit embedding into account, we can build up the order on the fly, without following the level-based algorithm.

These properties used to be assigned to each new object in the Lines constructor, but we can more efficiently stuff them into the secret and let these lazy accessors compute their values on-the-fly.
array comprehension parsing function parses and defines the three states of the list comprehension in order to avoid defining global variables, but keeping them to the list comprehension scope only.
hack to work around Android ScrollView a) not supporting zoom, and b) not supporting vertical scrolling when nested inside another vertical ScrollView (which it is, when displayed inside UIExplorer)
the URL comes in exactly as it was passed on the command line, or as normalized by normalize-package-data / read-package-json / read-installed, so figure out what to do with it using hosted-git-info
"Deferred-Dispatched Events":  - The current event plugin system will traverse the list of injected plugins, in order, and extract events by collecting the plugin's return value of `extractEvents()`.
IE complains about "unspecified error" when calling setSelectionRange() on an input element that's been removed from the DOM, so we wait until the selection range callback has fired to end this test.
IE8 can throw "Can't move focus to the control because it is invisible, not enabled, or of a type that does not accept the focus." for all kinds of reasons that are too expensive and fragile to test.
If you do need to enable this property for an animation, consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view **contents** are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).
Neither the name of the Snowtide Informatics Systems nor the names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.
Sync the actual display DOM structure with display.view, removing nodes for lines that are no longer in view, and creating the ones that are not there yet, and updating the ones that are out of date.
The goal here is to simulate the "file close" step happening so slowly that the whole close/rename process could finish before the file is actually closed (and thus buffers truely flushed to the OS).
The navigation view is initially not visible on the screen, but can be pulled in from the side of the window specified by the `drawerPosition` prop and its width can be set by the `drawerWidth` prop.
The tests for the nuclide-atom-script package cannot live in pkg/nuclide-atom-script/spec because nuclide-atom-script specifies a custom test runner as part of its implementation in its package.json.
These special components do the magic of binding the animated values to the properties, and do targeted native updates to avoid the cost of the react render and reconciliation process on every frame.
We make a best effort to throw an exception when given a format string we don't understand, rather than ignoring it, so that we won't break existing programs if/when we go implement the rest of this.
When the DEBUG_ATOM_SCRIPT environment variable is set, we forward stdout and stderr from the Atom process to stderr so that the stdout is only what is written by `console.log()` in the Atom process.
it's quite possible we're in the middle of a multiline comment, so we'll cycle up looking for an opening comment, and if there's one (and not a closing `*/`), then we'll ignore this line as a comment
