A Bison parser, made by GNU Bison 2.4.1.
As a special exception, you may create a larger work that contains part or all of the Bison parser skeleton and distribute that work under terms of your choice, so long as that work isn't itself a parser generator using the skeleton or a modified version thereof as a parser skeleton.
Put the tokens into the symbol table, so that GDB and other debuggers know about them.
See the GNU General Public License for more details.
This special exception was added by the Free Software Foundation in version 2.2 of Bison.
