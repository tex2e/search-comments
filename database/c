(A WAL reset or recovery will revert nBackfill to zero, but not increase its value.)  The caller must be holding sufficient locks to ensure that no other checkpoint is running (in any other thread or process) at the same time.
(Actually, it will also re-process any that have a length of zero, but that is a pathological case, and it does no harm.) When we find one, we temporarily terminate the branch it is in while we scan it.
(Adapted from an algorithm from the comp.graphics.algorithms FAQ.)
(Again, this is fixed "properly" in PCRE2.
(Also published in Collected Algorithms from CACM, algorithm number 199).
(An AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION in invoked PL/SQL must explicitly rollback/commit else the SELECT fails).
(And even if there were a way, the Interbase API doesn't provide a version of this function that takes a va_list as an argument)  In this case, the number of arguments is limited to 18 by the underlying API, so we can work around it.
(And note that OP_EXACT uses more memory, which we cannot get at this stage.)
(And of course isn't safe on any arch that requires memory barriers.)
(Aside: The use of inode numbers as unique IDs does not work on VxWorks.
(B)  The revised rowid for the row.
(BTREE_BLOBKEY is used for SQL indices.)
(BTREE_INTKEY is used for SQL tables.)  With BTREE_BLOBKEY, the key is an arbitrary BLOB and no content is stored anywhere - the key is the content.
(Bit 0 is for main, bit 1 is for temp, and so forth.)  Bits are set for each database that is used.
(Btrees store content ordered from left to right so the pages to the left have smaller keys than the pages to the right.) The next to left-most child of the root page is '/001', and so on, each sibling page identified by a 3-digit hex  value.
(But leave references to the ROWID column  unchanged.)  This routine is part of the flattening procedure.
(C)  The content of every column in the row.
(Can't trust DBL_MAX)
(Except, do not enforce this for imposter tables.)
(However, an EBCDIC equivalent has now been added.)
(I'm not a big fan of non-obvious flow control macros ).
(IDNA2003 always performs a BiDi check.)
(If a more complicated default expression value was provided, it is evaluated  when the ALTER TABLE is executed and one of the literal values written into the sqlite_master table.)  Therefore, the P4 parameter is only required if the default value for the column is a literal number, string or null.
(If the block special device really has zero length, the fact that it is empty will be detected and reported correctly when we read the file.)
(If the destination is not initially empty, the rowid fields of index entries might need to change.)  (2) The destination has a unique index.
(If there is no group 2, there is no problem, because offset_top will then be 2, indicating no capture.)
(If we discarded the buffer at the end of one image, we'd likely lose the start of the next one.) This makes it unsafe to use this manager and a different source manager serially with the same JPEG object.
(If you do not have  the "sqlite3.h" header file at hand, you will find a copy embedded within the text of this file.
(In other words, after a power-loss event, parts of the file that were never written might end up being altered.)  However, non-PSOW behavior is very, very rare.
(In other words, sqlite3PagerWrite() has already been called on the new page.)  The new page has also been referenced and the calling routine is responsible for calling sqlite3PagerUnref() on the new page when it is done.
(In other words, the "major" token.)  +  The semantic value stored at this level of the stack.
(In other words, the callback is invoked before visiting children.)  The return value from the callback should be one of the WRC_* constants to specify how to proceed with the walk.
(In some VFSes, the xTruncate method is a no-op, but that does not change the fact the SQLite will invoke it.)  (9) Whenever the database file is modified, at least one bit in the range of bytes from 24 through 39 inclusive will be changed prior to releasing the EXCLUSIVE lock, thus signaling other connections on the same database to flush their caches.
(In that case, we'd really want to copy the outer WHERE-clause terms onto the HAVING clause of the inner query.
(In this context 'database page' refers to any page that is not part of the pointer map itself.)  Each pointer map entry consists of a single byte 'type' and a 4 byte parent page number.
(It turns out to be convenient at runtime to detect this kind of subpattern at both the start and at the end.) The use of special opcodes makes it possible to reduce greatly the stack usage in pcre_exec().
(Locking is checked by assert()).
(MacOSX only) Definitions of sqlite3_vfs objects for all locking methods plus implementations of sqlite3_os_init() and sqlite3_os_end().
(No checking for duplicate index names is done.)  The search order is TEMP first, then MAIN, then any auxiliary databases added using the ATTACH command.
(No checking for duplicate table names is done.)  The search order is TEMP first, then MAIN, then any auxiliary databases added using the ATTACH command.
(Note that IEEE arithmetic is disabled by gcc's -ffast-math flag.)  This strtod returns a nearest machine number to the input decimal string (or sets errno to ERANGE).

(Some function, and in particular the date and time functions, are implemented separately.)
(Some simple cases are caught at compile time.)
(Sometimes new memory has to be allocated on an INSERT.)  The cost of a TEST with a new batch number is O(NlogN) where N is the number of elements in the RowSet.
(Steps 0 - NUMTYPES-1 ) If additional info is wanted we check again with DNS_T_ANY (step NUMTYPES / NUMTYPES+1 ) store_results is used to skip storing the results retrieved in step NUMTYPES+1 when results were already fetched.
(That assignment requires a cast.)  Then we call the function that x points to.
(That is not a completely accurate description because WhereLoop costs are a vector, not a scalar, and because dependencies are many-to-one, not one-to-one as are graph nodes.
(That is, pretend that each branch is the only one.) In the real compile phase, insert an ALT node.
(That said, I'm pretty sure the Hack typechecker actually does always write identical data, but the hashtable doesn't need quite that strong of an invariant.)  The operations implemented, and their limitations:  -) Concurrent writes: SUPPORTED One will win and the other will get dropped on the floor.
(The "_LIMIT_" in the name is changed to "_MAX_".)
(The CONTEXTJ check is new in IDNA2008.)
(The caller enforces this restriction since this routine does not have enough information to know.)  (5) The WHERE clause expression originates in the ON or USING clause of a LEFT JOIN.
(The choice of 16 is arbitrary, but let's stick to it now.
(The default is pairwise merging.)
(The error only occurs in one place now, but we retain the subroutine to minimize code disruption.)
(The function will only free the JIT data if the bit remains set, as the bit indicates that the pointer to the data is valid.)
(The page number should have been put there by the sqliteOpenCb routine.)
(The stack grows from low addresses to high addresses.)  The initial part of the stack segment linkage control information is 0200 (octal) words.
(The xfer optimization  is unable to test uniqueness.)  (3) onError is something other than OE_Abort and OE_Rollback.
(There is an immediate jump to ignoreDest.)  NOT NULL         REPLACE      The NULL value is replace by the default value for that column.
(Third-party VFS implementations might also make the distinction between SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL and SQLITE_SYNC_FULL, but among the operating systems natively supported by SQLite, only Mac OSX cares about the difference.)
(This assumed value is only about 1/2 second less than the value used by modern astronomers -- not bad for a number that was determined so long ago.)  The first molad of year 1 occurred on Sunday at 11:20:11 P.M.
(This defaults to 100 if the width can't be detected).
(This despite the fact that every last chip has oodles of memory these days, and techniques for extending the stack have been known for decades.) So....
(This is largely to prevent certain holidays from occurring on the day before or after the Sabbath.)  2.
(This is only checked in the single-threaded case since checking in the multi-threaded case would be much more complicated.)
(This is so that it works from duplicated subpatterns.) The state of the capturing groups is preserved over recursion, and re-instated afterwards.
(This is the CONFIG_FPE_FASTFPE option.)  On such systems, floating point byte swapping becomes very complicated.
(This is the same as the number of rows in the table, except for partial indices.)  The second integer is the average number of rows in the index that have the same value in the first column of the index.
(This means that virtual tables cannot participate in the LIKE optimization.)  The collating sequence for the column on the LHS must be appropriate for the operator.
(This paragraph is written on 2008-11-28.) These days, all Linux kernels support large files, so you should probably leave LFS enabled.

(Without this restriction, a query like: "SELECT x FROM (SELECT max(y), x FROM t1)" would not necessarily return the value X for which Y was maximal.)   In this routine, the "p" parameter is a pointer to the outer query.

(if already existing PHPDBG_WATCH_IMPLICIT flag is added) Create a PHPDBG_WATCH_SIMPLE watch for simple watches or a PHPDBG_WATCH_RECURSIVE watch for recursive watches When the target zval is an IS_REFERENCE, create a watchpoint on it too Each time a watchpoints parent is a zval and it is Z_REFCOUNTED(), put a watchpoint (WATCH_ON_REFCOUNTED) on it and add a watchpoint collision When in recursive mode and encountering a not-refcounted PHPDBG_WATCH_SIMPLE, remove it and recreate it with a PHPDBG_WATCH_RECURSIVE (handled via watch collision) Make attention to not add something twice or iterate over it twice  Deleting a watchpoint: Only allow deletion of recursive watches at their root and simple watches Go to referenced variable.

(pAppData is a pointer to a pointer because silly C90 rules prohibit a void* from being cast to a function pointer and so we have to go through the intermediate pointer to avoid problems when compiling with -pedantic-errors on GCC.)  The FINDER parameter to this macro is the name of the pointer to the finder-function.

- Don't assume there isn't a lookahead just because this state is a consistent state with a default action.
- Filter weight contribution results, after summing, are rounded to the nearest pixel color value instead of being casted to ILubyte (usually an int or char).
- If none of the src pixels within a sampling region differ, then the output pixel is forced to equal (any of) the source pixel.
- If this state is a consistent state with a default action, then the only way this function was invoked is if the default action is an error action.
- If you supply a mixture of handles and sockets, the system will interleave calls between select() and WaitForMultipleObjects().
- If you supply file handles, there is no way to distinguish between ready for read/write or OOB, so any set in which the handle is found will be marked as ready.
- If you supply only sockets, this simply passes through to winsock select().
- In case of PHP_DNS_ANY we use the directly fetch DNS_T_ANY.
- Last solution: average the colors
- NetWare doesn't require first parameter - Allowing LibC to choose the buffer size for now
- Of course, the expected token list depends on states to have correct lookahead information, and it depends on the parser not to perform extra reductions after fetching a lookahead from the scanner and before detecting a syntax error.
- One to One mapping between C structures and actual values, unlike ensor which forces one to understand the arcana of the xmlrpc vocab.
- Refer to PS_* macros in php_session.h for function/parameter definitions.
- Returning FAILURE state from PS_* function results in raising errors.
- Save handler _MUST_ use PS_GET_MOD_DATA()/PS_SET_MOD_DATA() macro to set/get save handler module data(mod_data).
- The argument "all" determines if all numeric entities are decode or only those that correspond to quotes (depending on quote_style).
- The only way there can be no lookahead present (in yychar) is if this state is a consistent state with a default action.
- Various output options, including: xml escaping via CDATA or entity, case folding, vocab version, and character encoding.
- We emulate an or'ed type mask by querying type by type.
- a function to release a userdata struct when it is no longer being managed by the cache  In the event of a cache miss the cache is allowed to grow up to a specified maximum size.

-) Concurrent reads: SUPPORTED If interleaved with a concurrent write, the read will arbitrarily say that there is no data at that slot or return the entire new data written by the concurrent writer.

2.0.10: before the drawing routines, some code to clip points that are outside the drawing window.
2.0.10: needs a transparent-index check that is still valid if the source is not truecolor.
2.0.12: Brush palette, image truecolor (thanks to Thorben Kundinger for pointing out the issue)
2.0.12: Slaven Rezic: palette images are not the only images with a simple transparent color setting.
2.0.12: Steven Brown: support a single totally transparent color in the original.
2.0.12: TBB: alpha in the destination should be a component of the result.
2.0.12: a new adaptation from the same original, this time by Barend Gehrels.
2.0.12: detect bad truecolor .gd files created by pre-2.0.12.
2.0.12: support truecolor properly in .gd as well as in .gd2.
2.0.12: this is finally a parameter
2.0.13: Bob Ostermann: don't force autohint, that's just for testing freetype and doesn't look as good
2.0.15: moved down below declarations to satisfy non-C++ compilers.
2.0.16: Optimization by Ilia Chipitsine -- don't waste time offscreen
2.0.16: Paul den Dulk found an occasion where total can be 0
2.0.16: clip to clipping rectangle, Matt McNabb
2.0.16: clipping rectangle, not image bounds
2.0.16: thread safety (the font cache is shared)
2.0.18: space was a oor choice for this.
2.0.1: use gdImageSetPixel to do the alpha blending work, or to just store the alpha level.
2.0.1: work around a gcc bug by being verbose.
2.0.21: we don't reallocate memory we don't own
2.0.22: save the APP14 marker to check for Adobe Photoshop CMYK files with inverted components.
2.0.22: very basic support for reading CMYK colorspace files.
2.0.24: inptr must not be incremented until after transparency check, if any.
2.0.2: alpha blending is now on by default, and saving of alpha is off by default.
2.0.5: can't use gdTrueColorGetRed, etc with palette
2.0.5: mode_mono fix from Giuliano Pochini
2.0.5: we should actually return this
2.0.9, Thomas Winzig: apply simple full transparency
2.0.9: Thorben Kundinger: Maybe the source image is not a truecolor image
2.0.9: fixed by Thomas Winzig
2.05: remap to the palette available in the destination image.
2.0: much easier when the destination is truecolor.

Additionally to the index, we also store the variable, to ensure that it is not destroyed during serialization and its pointer reused.
Additionally, *pzErrmsg may be set to point to a buffer containing a utf-8 formatted English language error message.
Additionally, a macro named "winIoerrCanRetry2" may be defined.
Additionally, because the index updates are likely to be applied in random order, access to pages within the database is also likely to be in  random order, which is itself quite inefficient.
Additionally, if SQLITE_DEBUG is defined, an instance of the following structure is used to record the current transaction state.
Additionally, if xBestIndex sets the SQLITE_INDEX_SCAN_UNIQUE flag, then SQLite also assumes that if a call to the xUpdate() method is made as part of the same statement to delete or update a virtual table row and the implementation returns SQLITE_CONSTRAINT, then there is no need to rollback any database changes.
Additionally, in auto-vacuum mode, the following events may invalidate an overflow page-list cache.
Additionally, set output variable *pzErrmsg to point to a buffer containing an error message.
Additionally, successful attempts to obtain exclusive xShmLock() WRITER, CHECKPOINTER and READ0 locks on the target  database file are recorded.
Additionally, the bits corresponding to pgno in Pager.pInJournal (bitvec of pages already written to the journal file) and the PagerSavepoint.pInSavepoint bitvecs of any open savepoints are set.
Additionally, the callback function is invoked for each frame written to the WAL since the start of the transaction.
Additionally, this extension allows the work involved in writing the  large transaction to be broken down into sub-transactions performed  sequentially by separate processes.
Additionally, xShmLock() calls are no-ops on target database files in RBU_STAGE_OAL mode.

And add it to the output array
And an in-memory journal.
And as sub-transactions are opened/closed:  xSavepoint(int S):  Open savepoint S.
And asserting PSOW makes a large reduction in the amount of required I/O for journaling, since a lot of padding is eliminated.
And because indices might  exist on the table t1, a complete scan of the data might be avoided.

And do not close the OP_OpenWrite cursors created for the ONEPASS optimization.
And each index consists of multiple levels ("relative levels").

And if an IO error occurs while doing so, then corruption may follow.
And if iSet is -1, assume that there is no  need to insert the key into the temp table, as it will never  be tested for.
And if that is the case, there is no point in having more than a few dozen values in any of the other situations described above.
And if the journal-mode is "OFF", the journal file must not be open.
And if this overflow cell is present, it must be the cell with  index iParentIdx.
And if we were originally supposed to be blocking, let's reset the socket to that.
And instead of referencing the variable directly, we use its constant as a key to lookup the run-time allocated buffer that holds real variable.
And it is very important that btreeInitPage() be called on every btree page so we make the call for every page that comes in for re-initing.
And lower the cost estimate to encourage the constrained version to be used.
And make sure list length does not exceed SQLITE_LIMIT_COMPOUND_SELECT.
And many do not understand the "LL" notation.
And never reduce the maximum page count below the current size of the database.
And never try to change the state of exceptions and never implement anything that gives the user anything to accomplish this.
And no memory allocations are required.
And none of the simple select queries that make up the compound SELECT are allowed to be aggregate or distinct queries.
And now, just to make sure things don't run too fast.
And of course this will affect backup programs
And other similarly odd results.
And page 1 is never written to the log until the transaction is committed.
And remove watch collision on *parent* (if there is a parent) If it is Z_REFCOUNTED(), remove that watch collision  Watch collisions: hold a counter for recursive, if it is incremented from 0 to 1, create recursive watchpoint holds a HashTable for normal (not implicit) watchpoints ...
And set the Expr.iRightJoinTable to iTable for every term in the expression.
And since AFP is only supported on MacOSX, the proxy locking is also restricted to MacOSX.
And since it can be determined whether the year is a leap year by simple division, the lengths of Adar I and II can be easily calculated.
And since the statement required here reads from this very virtual  table, saving it creates a circular reference.
And so forth until the length of WherePaths equals the number of nodes in the FROM clause.
And so forth.
And so long as the db is not a  temporary or in-memory database.
And so on up the tree.
And so on, for each cell in the array.
And so on, until the contents of pMerger are exhausted.
And so, we choose to ignore the compiler warnings and leave this variable uninitialized.
And swap arguments.
And that error has been propagated ever since.
And that the final byte of the doclist is 0x00.
And that the required b-tree mutex is held to make the pager rollback and schema reset an atomic operation.
And the BLOB type is first.
And the array itself.
And the largest supported cell size is 48 bytes (8 byte rowid + ten 4 byte coordinates).
And the last byte of the free-block must lie on the database page.
And the masses rejoiced.
And the offset immediately following the term data.
And the xSavepoint() method  flushes the pending terms table.
And this is not what users expect when they get SQLITE_LOCKED_SHAREDCACHE.
And to delete index entries
And to reduce the number of memory allocations, sometimes two or more Expr objects will be stored in a single memory allocation, together with Expr.zToken strings.
And to the contents of all position lists that will be copied and merged from the input to the output.
And vice-versa.
And we add the strings at the end.
And we apply the position
And we do not want the assert() containing the call to sqlite3_mutex_held() to fail, so a non-zero return is the appropriate thing to do.
And we recursively call the layout algorithm for this child
And what is supposed to go as user interaction, error log, etc.
And when running a test binary via adb shell, it's easy to miss logcat.
And yet the library dlsym() routine returns a void* which is really a pointer to a function.
And, ensure that the referenced method is resolvable, too.
And, even if it is not, it should not be too much slower.
And, if currently processing a CTE expression, if it is a recursive reference to the current CTE.
And, in fact, this routine is never called in a working implementation.
And, obviously, for this to be so there  must be an open write transaction on the file itself.
Android-L and M bionic's pthread implementation differ significantly, and can change any time.

Another recently proposed change in the leap year rule is to make years that are multiples of 4000 not a leap year, but this has never been officially accepted and this rule is not implemented in these algorithms.
Another solution would be to change the OP_SCopy used to copy cached values to an OP_Copy.

Apparently IBM isn't going to fix the problem, and we would rather not disable optimization (in this module it actually makes a big difference, and the pcre module can use all the optimization it can get).
Apparently invariant, left over from compress
Apparently it takes more time to parse and run the PRAGMA to turn journalling off than it does to write the journal header file.

Application writers should be aware that experimental interfaces are subject to change in point releases.
Applications are strongly discouraged from using this global variable.
Applications can substitute working mutex routines at start-time using the  sqlite3_config(SQLITE_CONFIG_MUTEX,...)  interface.
Applications must not attempt to access any of these methods if the iVersion of the VFS is less than 3.
Applications should not modify this structure directly - it should only be used as shown above with the xPhraseFirst() and xPhraseNext() API methods.
Applications that care about shared cache setting should set it explicitly.
Applications that define a custom xFileControl method should use opcodes greater than 100 to avoid conflicts.
Applications that invoke sqlite3_create_collation_v2() with a non-NULL xDestroy argument should  check the return code and dispose of the application data pointer themselves rather than expecting SQLite to deal with it for them.
Applications that override the built-in mutex logic must be prepared to accommodate additional static mutexes.
Applications that use SQLite mutexes should use only the dynamic mutexes returned by SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST or SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE.
Applications that use these interfaces must be prepared for any or all of these interfaces to be NULL or for their behavior to change from one release to the next.

As Firebird and InterBase are developed independently, functionality might be different between the two branches in future versions.
As PCRE1 is now in maintenance only mode, we finesse the bug by allowing more memory always.
As PHP strings have length inside, this function makes not much sense in the context of PHP, to be called as separate function.
As a a work-around, the SQLITE_OMIT_AUTORESET compile-time restores the legacy behavior of returning SQLITE_MISUSE for cases where the  previous sqlite3_step() returned something other than a SQLITE_LOCKED or SQLITE_BUSY error.
As a contributor, you agree to allow your code to be used under both.
As a last resort, return a non-persistent connection.
As a result,  it is extended to two fields.
As a result, a sqlite3.pDisconnect cannot be accessed simultaneously  by multiple threads.
As a result, in this case it is OK to delete a record from within a Next loop.
As a result, only the day number of the start of the year is required.
As a result, the call to xUndo may not fail.
As a result, we need to allocate our own TLS space while preserving the existing TCB that has been setup via librthread.
As a sanity check when loading from a file
As a special case, all 8 bytes of the 9th byte are used as data.
As a special case, alloca(0) reclaims storage without allocating any.
As a special exception, the "*" tag can be used as a language tag to declare a default ordering for any language that does not explicitly declare an ordering.
As a special exception, you may create a larger work that contains part or all of the Bison parser skeleton and distribute that work under terms of your choice, so long as that work isn't itself a parser generator using the skeleton or a modified version thereof as a parser skeleton.
As a test of the fault simulator mechanism itself, sqlite3FaultSim(0) is called immediately after installing the new callback and the return value from sqlite3FaultSim(0) becomes the return from sqlite3_test_control().
As a user of this code you may choose to use it under either license.
As a varint.
As all child key values are guaranteed to be NULL, it is not possible for adding this row to cause an FK violation.
As all the PCRE_ERROR_xxx values are negative, we can use 0 and 1.
As an optimization, SQLITE_AFF_BLOB entries (which are no-ops) at the beginning and end of zAff are ignored.
As an optimization, omit trailing SQLITE_AFF_BLOB affinities.
As before, show substrings stored in the output vector by number, and then also any named substrings.
As before, subsequent error messages are suppressed until three input tokens have been successfully shifted.
As configured by CursorSetHints()
As disgusting as on the darwin/386, darwin/amd64.
As each page of the file is loaded into memory, an instance of the following structure is appended and initialized to zero.
As each term visited by the linear scans, a separate query for the same term is performed.
As follows:  0: Parsing file-name.
As follows:  pzImposterCols: ...
As follows: 1: the *-rbu file is currently under construction.
As if it had just been returned by fts3tokOpenMethod().
As in "NEAR/nNear".
As in a large database update transmitted via a wireless network to a mobile device.
As in the case of is_anchored() (see above), we have to take account of back references to capturing brackets that contain .* because in that case we can't make the assumption.
As it happens, the "NOT" versions of these opcodes are used at present only for ASCII characters, so they could be omitted from this list.
As it happens, the pending terms table is always empty here.
As it is passed to us, we should not clean it ourselves.
As long as it's the case, it's just the constant limit.
As long as you retain this notice you can do whatever you want with this stuff.
As many as MX_CLOSE_ATTEMPT attempts to close the handle are made before giving up and returning an error.
As mentioned above, when compiled with SQLITE_PREFER_PROXY_LOCKING, setting the environment variable SQLITE_FORCE_PROXY_LOCKING to 1 will force proxy locking to be used for every database file opened, and 0 will force automatic proxy locking to be disabled for all database files (explicitly calling the SQLITE_FCNTL_SET_LOCKPROXYFILE pragma or sqlite_file_control API is not affected by SQLITE_FORCE_PROXY_LOCKING).
As more of the CREATE TABLE statement is parsed, additional action routines will be called to add more information to this record.
As of SQLite version 3.7.7, URI filename interpretation is turned off by default, but future releases of SQLite might enable URI filename interpretation by default.
As of curl 7.11.1 this is no longer defined inside curl.h
As originally  written the query must use a temp-table for at least one of the ORDER  BY and DISTINCT, and an index or separate temp-table for the other.
As part of the sorting process, it is converted to use the SorterRecord.u.pNext pointers.
As per the RFC, automatically redirected requests MUST NOT use other methods than GET and HEAD unless it can be confirmed by the user
As said, precision could be lost.
As some of the text is of unknown length, we can't use a table of offsets.
As the PDO emulation does not return it, we skip it as well
As the bits take less space in the protocol than the numbers they represent, we don't have enough space in the packet buffer to overwrite inside.
As the buffers have been freed, we should go back to PREPARED
As the code stands, it will do the right thing for R,G,B and B,G,R orders.
As the integrity-check proceeds, for each page used in the database the corresponding bit is set.
As the main database will be committed before the RBU update database this will likely either just pass unnoticed, or result in SQLITE_CONSTRAINT errors (due to UNIQUE constraint violations).
As the tile image can contain the same color as the color to fill.
As the winMutexInit() and winMutexEnd() functions are called as part of the sqlite3_initialize() and sqlite3_shutdown() processing, the "interlocked" magic used here is probably not strictly necessary.
As there exists an unusable MATCH constraint this is an  unusable plan.
As there is only one, we can use tail recursion to avoid using another stack frame, except when there is unlimited repeat of a possibly empty group.
As there may be shallow copies of this value, make it a soft-NULL
As these are otherwise illegal sequences, we don't break anything by recognizing them.
As they come as bit mask, we have to convert it to human-readable representation.
As this "NEAR" object is actually a single phrase that consists  of a single term only, grab pointers into the poslist managed by the fts5_index.c iterator object.
As this function relies on the InterBase API function isc_dsql_sql_info() which has a couple of limitations (which I hope will be fixed in future releases of Firebird), this function is fairly useless.
As time goes by, we may be able to get more clever at doing this.
As usual, return a negative , zero or positive value if *pMem1 is less than, equal to or greater than  pMem2, respectively.
As usual, the indexes in the position  lists are the offsets of the last token in each phrase (tokens "1" and "2"  in the example above).
As usual, the initial  "Length" field found in doclists stored on disk is omitted from this  buffer.
As we don't have a list of which groups are referenced, we cannot do this selectively.
As well as logging the contents of the list of pages headed by pList (connected by pDirty), this function notifies any active backup processes that the pages have changed.
As well as the main term index, there may be up to 31 prefix indexes.
As well as these, one memory cell is required for each cursor used by the program.
As will all I/O modules, most functions are for local use only (called via function pointers in the I/O context).
As with all file-control actions, there is no guarantee that this will actually do anything.
As with many strtoX implementations, should the subject sequence be empty or not well-formed, no conversion is performed and the original value of str is stored in *endptr, provided that endptr is not a null pointer.
As zend_multibyte_set_functions() gets called after ini settings were populated, we need to reinitialize script_encoding here.
Ascending order if Fts3Cursor.bDesc is zero, or descending if it is non-zero.
Ascii for "J"
Ascii value 4 is actually EOT character which is not defined anywhere in the LibC or else we can use instead of hardcoded 4.

Because IPK never has AFF_TEXT
Because P2 is always a static string, it is impossible for the sqlite3VdbeMemCopy() to fail
Because RSA_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING is used there is a restriction on the passwd_len.
Because a freeblock must be at least 4 bytes in size, any group of 3 or fewer unused bytes in the cell content area cannot exist on the freeblock chain.
Because an EXCLUSIVE lock is held on the database file, the log and log-summary files will be deleted.
Because an EXCLUSIVE lock on the db file is required to delete  a WAL on a none-empty database, this ensures there is no race condition  between the xAccess() below and an xDelete() being executed by some  other connection.
Because converting to double and back to long can lead to losing precision we need second variable.
Because for a non-constant expression we need to rerun this code each time.
Because in this case it is not possible  for garbage data to be appended to the file, the nRec field is populated with 0xFFFFFFFF when the journal header is written and never needs to be updated.
Because it has already been copied.
Because it is used within an expression that is an argument to another macro  (sqliteMallocRaw), it is not possible to use conditional compilation.
Because of OP_RECURSE, the data are not necessarly known in compile time, thus we need a dynamic restore mechanism.
Because of isCandidateForInOpt(p)
Because of the FTS3_NODE_PADDING bytes of padding, the following is  safe (no risk of overread) even if the node data is corrupted.
Because of the atomic-write  property of the host file-system, this is safe.
Because of the reference counting the user can't delete the strings the variables point to.
Because of the way auto-callout works during compile, a callout item is inserted between OP_COND and an assertion condition.
Because only the bound variables can point to our internal buffers, then separate or free only them.
Because positions are delta-encoded, the value of the previous position is needed in order to compute the value of the next position.
Because someone thought this was a good place to put timeval.
Because sqlite3_value_double() returns 0.0 if the argument is not something that can be converted into a number, we have: IMP: R-01992-00519 Abs(X) returns 0.0 if X is a string or blob that cannot be converted to a numeric value.
Because the Select object originates from a VALUES clause: (1) It has no LIMIT or OFFSET (2) All terms are UNION ALL (3) There is no ORDER BY clause
Because the change-counter page was just modified, unless the atomic-update optimization is used it is almost certain that the journal requires a sync here.
Because the intermediate RESERVED lock is not requested, any other process attempting to access the database file will get to  this point in the code and fail to obtain its own EXCLUSIVE lock  on the database file.
Because the parser constructs pTblName from a single identifier, sqlite3FixSrcList can never fail.
Because the register does not control the string, it might be deleted without the register knowing it.
Because the sets are unaligned, we need to perform byte comparison here.
Because the supported  syntax is relatively simple, the whole tokenizer/parser system is hand-coded.
Because there is guaranteed to be at least 74 (but not 136) bytes of padding following each buffer passed to varintRecordCompareInt() this makes it convenient to limit the size of the header to 64 bytes in cases where the first field is an integer.
Because there is no consistency, we will define our own.
Because this function only inspects interior segment nodes (and never loads leaf nodes into memory), it is not possible to be sure.
Because this intermediate value only needs 36 to 37 bits and the other numbers are constants, the process has been reduced to just a few steps.
Because this module is responsible for selecting indices, you might also think of this module as the "query optimizer".
Because we are moving code along, we must ensure that any pending recursive references are updated.
Because we can use one of the bytes of the length after we shifted as NUL termination.
Because writing to any of these nPage pages may damage the others, the journal file must contain sync()ed copies of all of them before any of them can be written out to the database file.
Before OP_ACCEPT there may be any number of OP_CLOSE opcodes, to close any currently open capturing brackets.
Before PCRE 8.34, we had to preserve the VT bit if it was previously set by something earlier in the character class.
Before a background thread is launched, variable bDone is set to 0.
Before a virtual table xCreate() or xConnect() method is invoked, the sqlite3.pVtabCtx member variable is set to point to an instance of this struct allocated on the stack.
Before any PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE keywords are parsed.
Before calling sqlite3ExprDelete(), set the EP_Static flag.
Before calling this routine *pi must be initialized to the value of the previous position, or zero if we are reading the first position in the position-list.
Before checking for a possessive quantifier, we must skip over whitespace and comments in extended mode because Perl allows white space at this point.
Before checking that the live wal-index header has not changed since it was read, set Wal.minFrame to the first frame in the wal file that has not yet been checkpointed.
Before closing the log file, this function attempts to take an  EXCLUSIVE lock on the database file.
Before deleting the journal file, obtain a RESERVED lock on the database file.
Before doing anything else, call the xSync() callback for any virtual module tables written in this transaction.
Before doing so, abort any other statements this handle currently has active.
Before doing so, figure out if there is an explicit column specifier for the token.
Before doing so, we have to insert the character for the previous code.
Before doing this the RBU module takes an EXCLUSIVE lock on the database file, ensuring that there are no other active readers.
Before doing this, remember the cursor number for the original outer query FROM element in iParent.
Before it is called, the partially compiled regex must be temporarily terminated with OP_END.
Before populating the accumulator registers, clear the column cache.
Before returning, *paPoslist is set to point to the position lsit  associated with pPhrase.
Before returning, *pnOp is set to the number of entries in the returned array.
Before returning, *pnVal is incremented by the current cache hit or miss count, according to the value of eStat.
Before returning, *pp is set to point 1 byte past the end of the value written.
Before returning, *ppCollist is set to point to the first byte after the last varint in the column-list (either the 0x00 signifying the end of the position-list, or the 0x01 that precedes the column number of the next column in the position-list).
Before returning, *pzAff is set to point to a buffer containing a copy of the column affinity string of the index allocated using sqlite3DbMalloc().
Before returning, *pzBuffer is set to the first byte past the portion of the buffer copied into by this function.
Before returning, all pointer-map entries corresponding to pages  that the new child-page now contains pointers to are updated.
Before returning, page pTo is reinitialized using btreeInitPage().
Before returning, set *piEof to the offset immediately following the last byte written to the file.
Before returning, set *pnSz to the number of bytes in the position list, and *pbDel to true if the delete flag is set, or false otherwise.
Before returning, set pzOut to point to a new buffer containing a nul-terminated, dequoted copy of the gobbled word.
Before returning, this function always sets *pbFirst to 1 and *piPrev to the value of parameter iVal.
Before running the loop, check for UTF-8 and whether CRLF is a valid newline sequence.
Before the first write, give the VFS a hint of what the final file size will be.
Before this function returns, it is updated to contain a copy of zTerm/nTerm.
Before using MustBeInt, make a copy of the value.
Before we can access the substrings, we must extract the table for translating names to numbers, and the size of each entry in the table.
Before writing anything to the database file, this lock is upgraded to an EXCLUSIVE lock.

But  if we are unlucky, another process that is holding a lock might get paged out or take a page-fault that is time-consuming to resolve,  during the few nanoseconds that it is holding the lock.
But 4 and 5 byte types use so much data space that there can only be 4096 and 32 of them, respectively.
But 5 leading slashes is a  common error, we are told, so we handle it as a special case.
But 8_3_NAMES is only used for FAT filesystems and permissions do not matter there, so just use the default permissions.
But I/O is more efficient if it occurs in page-sized blocks where each block is aligned on a page boundary.
But LFS does not exist in the kernel in Red Hat 6.0, so the code won't work.
But MSVC chokes on ((void*)(X)).
But OP_Column is measurably faster by skipping the subsequent conditional, which is always true.
But SQLite will only request a recursive mutex in cases where it really needs one.
But _XOPEN_SOURCE define causes problems for Mac OS X, so omit it.
But a 64-bit integer can be used at compile-time if desired.
But a NULL pointer always differs from a non-NULL pointer.
But a single Win95 reader will lock out all WinNT readers and a single WinNT reader will lock out all other Win95 readers.
But allow the walk to continue with sibling nodes.
But as N is rarely more than 1, this should not be a problem.
But as long as you do not compile with SQLITE_OMIT_AUTOINIT this routine will be called automatically by key routines such as sqlite3_open().
But as this is a deprecated interface, we will not bother to check for that condition.
But because of quirks of some compilers, we have to specify the value in the less intuitive manner shown:
But because the dummy.opcode is 0, dummy will never be written to.
But before calling APIs that follow, extension should check the sqlite3_libversion_number() to make sure they are dealing with a library that is new enough to support that API.
But before doing so, code a Noop instruction and store its address in  Index.tnum.
But beginning with version 3.7.0, we changed this so that sqlite3_reset() would be called automatically instead of throwing the SQLITE_MISUSE error.
But btree.c is getting too big and we want to break it down some.
But by initializing the checksum to random value which is different for every journal, we minimize that risk.
But by separating it out, the code will be automatically omitted from static links that do not use it.
But by the time the value is used, the original register may have been used, invalidating the underlying buffer holding the text or blob value.
But by using this automatically generated code, the size of the code is substantially reduced.
But continue to take the absolute value of the default cache size of historical compatibility.
But do not delete the JsonParse object itself.
But do not free the associated  memory allocation.
But don't leave a totally empty module because some compilers barf at that.
But don't make them a single int bitfield
But due to a coding error in versions of SQLite prior to 3.6.0, databases with freelist trunk pages holding more than usableSize/4 - 8 entries will be reported as corrupt.
But each instance of this object points to the same BtShared object.
But for all other platforms, it is highly recommended that applications neither read nor write this variable.
But for internal pages, that has not yet been done, so do it now
But for maximum safety, mutexes should be enabled.
But for that to be true, the next byte must contain either whitespace, an open or close parenthesis, a quote character, or EOF.
But for the static  mutex types, the same mutex is returned on every call that has the same type number.
But for the static mutex types, the same mutex is returned on every call that has the same type number.
But for things like temporary table (which will be deleted when the power is restored) we don't care.
But generally, doing both brings us on the safe track at least in NTS build.
But if (due to a coding error elsewhere in the system) it does get called, just return the same error code without doing anything.
But if 1 is returned when it should not be, then incorrect answers might result.
But if SQLITE_MAX_VARIABLE_NUMBER is greater than 32767 we have to make it 32-bit.
But if a TEMP trigger is created on a non-TEMP table and the table is dropped by a different database connection, the trigger is not visible to the database connection that does the drop so the trigger cannot be dropped.
But if a file in a different directory from the database file is used, then differing access permissions or a chroot() might cause two different processes on the same database to end up using different files for shared memory -  meaning that their memory would not really be shared - resulting in database corruption.
But if a power failure occurred while the journal was being written, it could be the case that the size of the journal file had already been increased but the extra entries had not yet made it safely to disk.
But if a term also satisfies case 1 (such as B) we know that the optimizer will always prefer case 1, so in that case we pretend that case 3 is not satisfied.
But if it is, then the automatic journal playback and recovery mechanism will deal with it under an EXCLUSIVE lock where we do not need to worry so much with race conditions.
But if the -s option has been given, we skip this optimization, since on some systems, stat() reports zero size for raw disk partitions.
But if the VDBE has just been set to run but has not actually executed any instructions yet, leave the main database error information unchanged.
But if the WHERE_ONETABLE_ONLY flag is set, then we should only generate code for the first table in pTabList and assume that any cursors associated with subsequent tables are uninitialized.
But if the coroutine launched by this instruction ends with EndCoroutine, then jump to P2 rather than continuing with the next instruction.
But if the cursor advance was successful, jump immediately to P2.
But if the cursor backup was successful, jump immediately to P2.
But if the file being opened is a WAL or regular journal file, then  this function queries the file-system for the permissions on the  corresponding database file and sets *pMode to this value.
But if the largest existing rowid is already the maximum positive integer, we have to fall through to the second probabilistic algorithm  The second algorithm is to select a rowid at random and see if it already exists in the table.
But if the operating system crashes or there is an abrupt power failure when synchronous is off, the database could be left in an inconsistent and unrecoverable state.
But if the parent term was originally TERM_LIKE, then the parent gets TERM_LIKECOND instead.
But if the tables have indices and there are terms in the WHERE clause that refer to those indices, a complete table scan can be avoided and the code will run much faster.
But if the value is zero, make it 65536.
But if there was previously a read-lock, do not invoke the busy handler - just return SQLITE_BUSY.
But if you get a 0 or 1 return, then you can be sure the expressions are the same.
But in SQLite, the table can now be identified by a database name, a dot, then the table name: ID.ID.
But in fact, mem1.u.i will never actually be used uninitialized, and doing  the unnecessary initialization has a measurable negative performance impact, since this routine is a very high runner.
But initializing the memory prevents valgrind from complaining, so we are willing to take the performance hit.
But instead of invoking a callback for each row, malloc() for space to hold the result and return the entire results at the conclusion of the call.
But instead of running the code, it invokes the callback once for each instruction.
But it also reduces the size of the library by 738 bytes on ix86.
But it does destroy memory structures of the indices and foreign keys associated with  the table.
But it is a bug to return 1 if the expression might have different boolean values in different circumstances (a false positive.)  Note that if the expression is part of conditional for a LEFT JOIN, then we cannot determine at compile-time whether or not is it true or false, so always return 0.
But it is a useful visualization aid.) Then a WherePath object is a path through the graph that visits some or all of the WhereLoop objects once.
But it is important to pass the correct size to  insertCell(), so reparse the cell now.
But it is safe to invoke this routine on when SQLite is already shut down.
But it is the best that can be done under the circumstances.
But it is useful for testing.
But it needs to be an integer before we can do the seek, so convert it.
But it preserves the Mem.zMalloc memory allocation.
But its access pattern is the same as header meta values, and so it is convenient to read it from this routine.
But just in case, use snprintf() and make sure the buffer is zero-terminated
But just read the header of a zero-length byte, don't read the body, there is no such.
But just to make sure it still operates correctly, verify that its count agrees with our  internal count when using count(*) and when the total count can be expressed as a 32-bit integer.
But later on, nLimit and nOffset become the memory locations in the VDBE that record the limit and offset counters.
But leave the (no-op) call to PendingTermsFlush() in in case that changes.
But let's have it for completeness.
But looking at the Cannon powershot's files, inches is the only sensible value.
But make pCellData point to the lower bound.
But many SQL implementations do.
But modify the name by adding an "sqlite_altertab_" prefix.
But multiple resets are harmless.
But no harm is done by this.
But no sync operations occur for an ordinary commit in NORMAL mode with WAL.
But node pLeft sometimes already has a node number.
But not if we are in secure-delete mode.
But not on unix.
But not so.
But now it has been modified by a transaction on the source pager.
But odds are that we will be inserting new entries at the end soon afterwards so the nearly empty page will quickly fill up.
But on a BEFORE trigger, we do not know what the unique ID will be (because the insert has not happened yet) so we substitute a rowid of -1
But on first evaluation, the P4 operand is automatically converted into an sqlite3_context object and the operation changed to this OP_Function opcode.
But on the 10th an subsequent retries, the delays start becoming longer and longer,  so that on the 100th (and last) RETRY we delay for 323 milliseconds.
But on the other hand, this routine is never called if we are already in an error state.
But one may not go from shared to exclusive or from exclusive to shared.
But one should test the page skipping logic  by setting PENDING_BYTE low and running the entire regression suite.
But only do the conversion if it is possible without loss of information and return the revised type of the argument.
But other modules are free to use it too, as long as no rollbacks are happening.
But pName should never be NULL.
But pSpan should never be NULL.
But please keep this copyright notice.
But prior changes due to the same operation are not backed out and no rollback occurs.
But rather than start with 0 or 1, we begin with 'A'.
But returning an incorrect 0 or 1 could lead to a malfunction.
But seems it happens in extreme cases or doesn't.
But since PAGER_ERROR state guarantees that there is at least one outstanding page reference, this function is a no-op for that case anyhow.
But since the right hand side of the equality constraint (t2.b) has BLOB/NONE affinity, no conversion should be attempted before using a t2.b value as part of a key to search the index.
But so far, none of that has been implemented in the core.
But some embedded platforms might lack LFS in which case the SQLITE_DISABLE_LFS macro might still be useful.
But some extreme users want to have prepared statements with over 32767 variables, and for them the option is available (at compile-time).
But sometime you might  want to place more severe limits on the complexity of an  expression.
But sometimes (for example when during a DROP of a large table) most or all of the pages in a database can get journalled.
But sqlite3SrcListShiftJoinType() later shifts the jointypes so that each jointype expresses the join between the table and the previous table.
But support for LinuxThreads was dropped beginning with version 3.7.0.
But taking advantage of this time dependency makes it more difficult to prove that the code is correct (in  particular, it prevents us from writing an effective implementation of sqlite3AssertMayAbort()) and so we have chosen to take the safe route and skip the optimization.
But that compiler magic ended up generating such a flurry of bug reports that we have taken it all out and gone back to using simple noop macros.
But that could change.
But that functionality is no longer supported.
But that is Ok, as that thread cannot return control to the VDBE or proceed with anything useful until the  first results are ready from this merger object anyway.
But that is a lot of wasted space on the left margin.
But that is impossible.
But that is no longer true.
But that is not due to sloppy coding habits.
But that is not possible as SQLite reference counts the virtual table objects.
But that will not work if other processes are attached to the original database.
But that would mean passing a sufficiently large expression to ExprParse() could cause a stack overflow.
But the FuncDefs for built-in functions are read-only.
But the allowed values are "grainy".
But the application does not want the user to be able to make arbitrary changes to the database.
But the caller cannot free this memory directly.
But the code generator expects the join operator to be on the right operand.
But the contents can be deleted.
But the delta string may contain embedded NUL characters (if the input and output are binary files) so we also have to pass in the length of the delta in the lenDelta parameter.
But the error is not detected until much later, and so we need to go ahead and resolve those symbols on the incorrect ORDER BY for consistency.
But the feature is undocumented.
But the initialization must be complete.
But the left-most 6 spaces have been removed to improve the readability.
But the main beneficiary of the transfer optimization is the VACUUM  command, and the VACUUM command disables foreign key constraints.
But the main library does not want to redefine the API.
But the probability of white noise equaling 16 bytes of 0xff is vanishingly small so we should still be ok.
But the race is benign since with WAL_RETRY this routine will be called again and will probably be right on the second iteration.
But the reason the mutex does not exist is because the build is not using mutexes.
But then Mcafee started using SQLite in their anti-virus product and it started putting files with the "sqlite" name in the c:/temp folder.
But then, on the other hand, dlsym() will not work on such a system either, so we have not really lost anything.
But there are serious downsides:  (1)  There is zero concurrency.
But there are some negative values that have special meaning:
But there is a serious risk of database corruption if this locking mode is used in situations where multiple database connections are accessing the same database file at the same time and one or more of those connections are writing.
But there is no way to know at compile-time which threading library is being used.
But there might be a LIMIT clause, in which case the order does matter
But there might be additional triggers on pTab in the TEMP schema.
But these numbers are not part of the result table itself.
But they are included in a few cases in order to enhance the resilience of SQLite to unexpected behavior - to make the code "self-healing" or "ductile" rather than being "brittle" and crashing at the first hint of unplanned behavior.
But they are stable, as they are part of the definition of the SQLite file format, which may not change.
But they make a real mess on VT100-style displays if they're not paired properly, so we are probably better off not calling them text.
But they might for a corrupt database.
But they probably won't help there so do not bother.)  (2) The inner query is the recursive part of a common table expression.
But this code here only works on OSX.
But this does not work if either limit is negative.
But this does not work on VxWorks.
But this file is the only place where the internal details of this structure are known.
But this implementation can be overridden at start-time.
But this is adapted to present re.c.
But this is not considered overhead as it would also be required by a crisis-merge that used the same input  segments.
But this is not so if the database is corrupted  in such a way that page pRoot is linked into a second b-tree table  (or the freelist).
But this method is used as a last resort.
But this might change in future releases of SQLite.
But this requires that the range scan loop run twice, once for strings and a second time for BLOBs.
But this routine must never return 0 if the two ExprList objects are different, or a malfunction will result.
But this sorting ephemeral index might end up being unused if the data can be extracted in pre-sorted order.
But this subroutine works for any value of nEq including 0.
But to avoid confusion we also all the SQLITE_ENABLE_FTS4 macro to serve as an alisse for SQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3.
But to avoid confusion we also call the SQLITE_ENABLE_FTS4 macro to serve as an alias for SQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3.
But to preserve backwards compatibility we continue to accept it.
But updating the actual wal-index header is also safe and means there is no special case for sqlite3WalUndo() to handle if this transaction is rolled back.
But wait:  there are yet more problems with POSIX advisory locks.
But we are getting ready to store this value back into an index, where it should be converted by to INTEGER again.
But we are told that HPUX is not such a platform.
But we can save a little space and improve the speed a little by numbering the values consecutively.
But we can still statically link against that API as long as we don't call it when running Win95/98/ME.
But we cannot delete it, in case the master journal file name was written into the journal file before the failure occurred.
But we do not want these changes to be permanent.
But we don't support COM_FIELD_LIST anymore, thus this should not happen
But we have found that many systems do not have a working isnan() function so this implementation is provided as an alternative.
But we have other optimizations in mind to deal with that case.
But we have to do some additional checking to see if case 1 really is satisfied.
But we keep a reference count in Btree.wantToLock so the behavior of this interface is recursive.
But we merge it with the header value access routines since its access pattern is the same.
But we need to go ahead and define the sqlite3_io_methods and finder function for proxy locking here.
But we need to make sure enough memory is allocated to avoid other spurious errors in the meantime.
But we track the other locking levels internally.
But we use the B term in "glob(B,A)".
But we want the maximum correction applied to a pixel to be much less, otherwise obviously wrong pixels will be created.
But we want to make maximum use of the bits in our bitmasks.
But we were allocated pgnoMove.
But when LIMIT and OFFSET became arbitrary expressions, we were forced to add restrictions (13) and (14).
But with POWERSAFE_OVERWRITE, the blast radius is zero (that is what POWERSAFE_OVERWRITE means), so we minimize the sector size.
But writing to all new pages forces the OS to allocate them immediately, which reduces the chances of SIGBUS while accessing the mapped region later on.
But, according to The Encyclopedia Judaica, Hillel II may have only published the 19 year rule for determining the occurrence of leap years.
But, do not do this if we are simply reading the sqlite_master table to parse the schema, or if this index is the PRIMARY KEY index of a WITHOUT ROWID table.
But, on Unix, the "commit" is implicit.
But, unlike Destroy, do not remove the table or index from the database file.
By Authors:  Spencer W.
By NULLing the dlopen() handle in the module entry, Zend omits the call to dlclose(), ensuring that the module will remain present until the process exits.
By adding this prefix, we insure that the name will not collide with an existing table because user table are not allowed to have the "sqlite_" prefix on their name.
By calling fflush(3), this data is send to the kernel using write(2).
By combining all the individual C code files into this  single large file, the entire code can be compiled as a single translation unit.
By contrast, if SQLITE_INDEX_SCAN_UNIQUE is not set and xUpdate returns SQLITE_CONSTRAINT, any database changes made by the xUpdate method are automatically rolled back by SQLite.
By convertCompoundSelectToSubquery()
By default PENDING_BYTE is set high so that we don't have to allocate an unused page except for very large databases.
By default darwin/arm processes start in "/".
By default the Expr.zSpan field holds a human-readable description of the expression that is used in the generation of error messages and column labels.
By default use a full table scan.
By default we have a tree of only one node
By default, RBU uses the default VFS to access the files on disk.
By default, ToASCII() uses transitional processing.
By default, ToUnicode() uses transitional processing.
By default, for compatibility with Perl, they are treated as literals.
By default, obtain space from malloc().
By default, the auxiliary write ahead log and shared memory files used for transaction control are automatically deleted when the latest connection to the database closes.
By default, the default C locale is used rather than what the building user happens to have set.
By default, the windows VFS will retry file read, file write, and file delete operations up to 10 times, with a delay of 25 milliseconds before the first retry and with the delay increasing by an additional 25 milliseconds with each subsequent retry.
By default, this is enabled and an isolated heap will be created to store all allocated data.
By default, this module parses the legacy syntax that has been  traditionally used by fts3.
By doing it to only one of these two, we deviate from a state that could be directly specified by a password to the buggy algorithm (and to the fully correct one as well, but that's a side-effect).
By handling this as a special case, we avoid deep recursion, and thus do not need to enforce the SQLITE_LIMIT_COMPOUND_SELECT on a VALUES clause.
By implementing a  custom page cache using this API, an application can better control the amount of memory consumed by SQLite, the way in which  that memory is allocated and released, and the policies used to  determine exactly which parts of a database file are cached and for  how long.
By locking a random byte from a range, concurrent SHARED locks may exist even if the locking primitive used is always a write-lock.
By moving complex, but seldom used logic, out of sqlite3BtreeLock() and into this routine, we avoid unnecessary stack pointer changes and thus help the sqlite3BtreeLock() routine to run much faster in the common case.
By overriding  system calls with functions under its control, a test program can simulate faults and error conditions that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to induce.
By passing this as the number of pages to copy to sqlite3_backup_step(), we can guarantee that the copy finishes  within a single call (unless an error occurs).
By returning SQLITE_BUSY and not invoking the busy callback when A already has a read lock, we encourage A to give up and let B proceed.
By scanning and tokenizing the content table.
By scanning the contents of the FTS index, and  2.
By themselves, these optimizations work fine and provide a handy performance boost to bulk delete or insert operations.
By this means we can handle the group by iteration rather than recursion, thereby reducing the amount of stack needed.
By use of various functions in this module the caller can create stacks, queues, lists, doubly linked lists, sorted lists, indexed lists.
Bypass the creation of the PRIMARY KEY btree and the sqlite_master table entry.

Doing it this way makes sense for Facebook internally since our build system has machinery for providing these two constants automatically (and no machinery for doing codegen in a consistent way to build an ocaml file with them) but is very roundabout for external users who have to have CMake codegen these constants anyways.
Doing nothing at all also makes NORMAL the default.
Doing so may cause the parent page to become overfull or underfull.
Doing so will not cause any errors, but is inefficient.

During a rollback, when the pager reloads information into the cache so that the cache is restored to its original state at the start of the transaction, for each page restored this routine is called.
During a write-transaction the fts5_index.c module may cache some data  in-memory.
During a write-transaction, if pages with page-numbers greater than dbSize are modified in the cache, dbSize is updated accordingly.
During code generation of statements that do inserts into AUTOINCREMENT  tables, the following information is attached to the Table.u.autoInc.p pointer of each autoincrement table to record some side information that the code generator needs.
During compilation, the "first char" settings from forward assertions are discarded, because they can cause conflicts with actual literals that follow.
During expression analysis, extra information is computed and moved into later parts of teh Expr object and that extra information might get chopped off if the expression is reduced.
During sqlite3_os_init() we do a GetSystemInfo() to get the granularity size.
During testing, it is often desirable to move the pending byte to a different position in the file.
During the search for the best function definition, this procedure is called to test how well the function passed as the first argument matches the request for a function with nArg arguments in a system that uses encoding enc.

Even after the writer process  has committed one or more sub-transactions, other database clients continue to read from the original database snapshot.
Even entries are the meta value number and odd entries are an increment to apply to the meta value after the vacuum.
Even for zero size payload we have to send a packet
Even if a read-transaction is not open, it is guaranteed that  there is no hot-journal in the file-system.
Even if a subsequent open() call does succeed, the consequences of not searching for a reusable file descriptor are not dire.
Even if an IO or diskfull error occurs while journalling the page in the block above, set the need-sync flag for the page.
Even if any illegal encoding is detected the result may contain a list of parsed encodings.
Even if it does, the miscompile might only occur on the production build, but not on a testing build (such as because of different optimization settings).
Even if it fails, *ppExpr may still be set to point to an  expression tree.
Even if pVal also contains NULL values.
Even if the data structure on disk is corrupted, this (reading two varints from the buffer) does not risk an overread.
Even if the match is empty, we need to reset the control head.

Even if we don't know its exact size yet, we already know the padding, border and margin.
Even in the case the payload is evenly divisible by this value, the last packet will be empty, namely 0 bytes.
Even reading previously freed memory might result in a segmentation fault or other severe error.
Even that has never been tested according to DB.
Even though any XCLASS list is now discarded, we must allow for its memory.
Even though the Mem structure contains an element of type i64, on certain architectures (x86) with certain compiler switches (-Os), gcc may align this Mem object on a 4-byte boundary instead of an 8-byte one.
Even though there is no encoding conversion, value_blob() might need to call malloc() to expand the result of a zeroblob()  expression.
Even though this opcode does not use dynamic strings for the result, result columns may become dynamic if the user calls sqlite3_column_text16(), causing a translation to UTF-16 encoding.
Even unfulfilled requests are counted
Even with the enabled per thread locale, localeconv won't check any locale change in the master thread.
Even without using the hash table, the last frame for page P can be found by scanning the page-mapping sections of each index block starting with the last index block and moving toward the first, and within each index block, starting at the end and moving toward the beginning.
Event counters from parent frame
Eventually, once all  outstanding transactions have been abandoned, the pager is able to transition back to OPEN state, discarding the contents of the  page-cache and any other in-memory state at the same time.
Every SQLite table must have either BTREE_INTKEY or BTREE_BLOBKEY set.
Every class contains at least two characters.
Every code point has a grapheme break property which is one of the ucp_gbXX values defined in ucp.h.
Every connected stream will be registered as resource (in EG(regular_list).
Every cursor is a candidate to be tripped, including cursors that belong to other database connections that happen to be sharing the cache with pBtree.
Every cursor that the virtual machine has open is represented by an instance of the following structure.
Every effort is made to force the conversion, even if the input is a string that does not look completely like a number.
Every interface that accepts sqlite3_value arguments specifies whether or not it requires a protected sqlite3_value.

Every one-row WhereLoop is automatically order-distinct.
Every one-row WhereLoop will have the WHERE_ONEROW bit set in wsFlags.
Every open database file (including each in-memory database and each temporary or transient database) has a single page cache which is an instance of this object.
Every page in the cache is controlled by an instance of the following structure.
Every page in the database contains 0 or 1 parent pages.
Every page of the database is written approximately 3 times:  Once for step (2) and twice for step (3).
Every statement that might do an INSERT into an autoincrement table (either directly or through triggers) needs to call this routine just before the "exit" code.
Every term of the FROM clause will have at least one corresponding WhereLoop object (unless INDEXED BY constraints prevent a query solution - which is an error) and many terms of the FROM clause will have multiple WhereLoop objects, each describing a potential way of implementing that FROM-clause term, together with dependencies and cost estimates for using the chosen algorithm.
Every thread initializes with a stack of size INIT_TOP_STACK.
Every user-visible function in PHP should document itself in the source

Exactly VdbeSorter.nTask instances of this object are allocated as part of each VdbeSorter object.
Exactly how it does this depends on whether or not the atomic-update optimization was enabled at compile time, and if this transaction meets the  runtime criteria to use the operation:   The file-system supports the atomic-write property for blocks of size page-size, and  This commit is not part of a multi-file transaction, and Exactly one page has been modified and store in the journal file.
Exactly one of  xGeom and xQueryFunc fields is non-NULL, depending on whether the SQL function was created using sqlite3_rtree_geometry_callback() or sqlite3_rtree_query_callback().
Exactly one of regOld and regNew should be non-zero.
Exactly one of the following macros must be defined in order to specify which memory allocation subsystem to use.
Exactly two arguments must be passed to this function.
Exactly when an expression is considered a column can be complex in the presence of subqueries.
Exactly which is determined by the zUsage argument.
Examine a WherePath (with the addition of the extra WhereLoop of the 5th parameters) to see if it outputs rows in the requested ORDER BY (or GROUP BY) without requiring a separate sort operation.
Example 1:  Consider a three-way compound SQL statement.
Example encodings:  1:    0x01 127:    0x7f 128:    0x81 0x00   Document lists **** A doclist (document list) holds a docid-sorted list of hits for a given term.
Example:  WHERE x IN (1,2,3,4)  Write the estimated row count into *pnRow and return SQLITE_OK.
Example: "c2chars/nints" will return an object with fields chars1, chars2, and ints.
Example: 1024 12: Checkpoint sequence number 16: Salt-1, random integer incremented with each checkpoint 20: Salt-2, a different random integer changing with each ckpt 24: Checksum-1 (first part of checksum for first 24 bytes of header).
Example: Suppose the join is like this:  A natural cross join B  The operator is "natural cross join".
Example: the row for WORD contains ucp_L, ucp_N, ucp_P, ucp_Po.
Examples of why this is not allowed:  t1 LEFT OUTER JOIN (t2 JOIN t3)  If we flatten the above, we would get  (t1 LEFT OUTER JOIN t2) JOIN t3  which is not at all the same thing.
Examples:  (SELECT a FROM b)          -- subquery EXISTS (SELECT a FROM b)   -- EXISTS subquery x IN (4,5,11)              -- IN operator with list on right-hand side x IN (SELECT a FROM b)     -- IN operator with subquery on the right  The pExpr parameter describes the expression that contains the IN operator or subquery.
Except for some memory allocation errors,  an error message held in memory obtained from malloc is returned if *pnErr is non-zero.
Except see the bug regarding a race condition php_sysvsem_get().
Except when the whole stack frame must be saved.
Except, any file that is greater than 0 bytes in size is considered to have at least one page.
Except, do not close cursors that will be reused by the OR optimization (WHERE_OMIT_OPEN_CLOSE).
Except, do not disable the term if it controls a LEFT OUTER JOIN and it did not originate in the ON or USING clause of that join.
Except, each sample may be extended to ensure that it is greater than or equal to the previous sample in the array.
Except, entries in the copy of the string associated with equality constraints that use BLOB or NONE affinity are set to SQLITE_AFF_BLOB.
Except, if N is set to 0 then the upper layers will never invoke the xFetch interfaces to the VFS.
Except, if Pager.eLock is set to UNKNOWN_LOCK when this function is  called, do not modify it unless the new locking state is EXCLUSIVE_LOCK.
Except, if Pager.eLock is set to UNKNOWN_LOCK when this function is called, do not modify it.
Except, if SQLITE_4_BYTE_ALIGNED_MALLOC is defined, then the underlying malloc() implementation might return us 4-byte aligned pointers.
Except, if createFlag is true, that means that we are trying to install a new function.
Except, if pTree is a root node, do not write it to the database.
Except, if the 0 byte is preceded by a byte with the 0x80 bit set, then it is not a varint 0, but the tail of some other, multi-byte, value.
Except, if the background thread from a sub-tasks previous turn is still running, skip it.
Except, if the delta string is malformed or intended for use with a source file other than zSrc, then this routine returns -1.
Except, if the other Btree object has the read-uncommitted flag set, then it is OK for the other object to have a read cursor.
Except, if the pager is in-memory only, then return an empty string if nullIfMemDb is true.
Except, if the value is an SQL NULL, return  0 instead.
Except, if there are already N worker threads running, the main thread does the work itself.

Following a rollback, the database file should be back in its original state prior to the start of the transaction, so invoke the SQLITE_FCNTL_DB_UNCHANGED file-control method to disable the assertion that the transaction counter was modified.
Following a suggestion from Stan Switzer, the use of longjmp() has been abolished, at the cost of having to provide a unique number for each call to RMATCH.
Following an incremental-merge operation, assuming that the input segments are not completely consumed (the usual case), they are updated in place to remove the entries that have already been merged.
Following any hot-journal  rollback, the contents of the cache are validated by checking the 'change-counter' field of the database file header and discarded if they are found to be invalid.

For  AND or OR nodes, it contains 2 or more entries.
For  each column that is being updated, the corresponding character is set to 'x'.
For  example, the following:  "a OR b AND c NOT d NEAR e"  is equivalent to:  "a OR (b AND (c NOT (d NEAR e)))"
For 11 and above, the session pool has its own mechanism for doing so for purity NEW connections.
For 2-way joins, the 5 best paths are followed.
For ALT, we continue with the next alternative, but we have to arrange that the final result from subpattern is SSB_CONTINUE rather than SSB_DONE.
For ARRAY and OBJECT types, the number might be larger.
For ASCII, any character with the high-order bit set is allowed in an identifier.
For BC we have to check whether the key is numeric and use it like this
For COND brackets, we wrap the whole thing in a possessively repeated non-capturing bracket, because we have not invented POS versions of the COND opcodes.
For DETACH, set it to false (expire all existing statements).
For DOCID_CMP macro
For EBCDIC, the rules are more complex but have the same end result.
For EUC-JP.
For FTS5_STRING - cluster of phrases
For Go, this means we cannot generate a panic, which cannot be recovered, and so tests fail.
For HTTP/1.0 conforming clients
For HTTP/1.1 conforming clients
For IN operators or if an error occurs, the return value is 0.
For INTKEY tables, the intKey parameter is used.
For KET, return SSB_CONTINUE: if this is the top level, that indicates failure, but after a nested subpattern, it causes scanning to continue.
For LC_MESSAGES
For LIKE and GLOB matching on EBCDIC machines, assume that every character is exactly one byte in size.
For MATCH_MATCH, the group has matched, so we restart it with a new subject starting position, remembering that we had at least one match.
For MATCH_NOMATCH, carry on with the alternatives, as usual.
For MS SqlServer compatibility
For MS Visual Studio and Symbian OS, there are problems in initializing these variables to non-local functions.
For MinGW version 4.x (and higher), check to see if the _USE_32BIT_TIME_T define is required to maintain binary compatibility with the MSVC runtime library in use (e.g. for Windows XP).

For PS - if stmt_store() is performed, thus we don't have a cursor, it will behave just like old-API buffered.
For PS, we leave them in Prepared state
For SCI you encode the S, then have to remember to skip the C.
For SHOW we don't create (bypasses PS in server) a result set at prepare and thus a connection was missing
For SQL_SUCCESS, the length is in vallen.
For SRT_Output, results are stored in a sequence of registers.
For STRING expressions, the near cluster
For THEN (and THEN_ARG) we pass back the address of the opcode, so that the branch in which it occurs can be determined.
For UNIQUE indexes, verify that only one entry exists with the current key.
For UNUSED dst.
For VxWorks, we have to use the alternative unique ID system based on canonical filename and implemented in the previous division.)  The sqlite3_file structure for POSIX is no longer just an integer file descriptor.
For WAL mode, OFF continues to mean that no syncs ever occur.
For WinCE, some API function parameters do not appear to be declared as volatile.
For XCLASS items
For a  leaf node, the doclist is passed as aDoclist/nDoclist.
For a DEFINE group, required and first character settings are not relevant.
For a K-column index, there will be K+1 integers in the stat column.
For a LEFT OUTER JOIN, generate code that will record the fact that at least one row of the right table has matched the left table.
For a MATCH search, this will be the next row that matches.
For a NOT node, this array always contains 2 entries.
For a Real or Integer, use sqlite3_snprintf() to produce the UTF-8 string representation of the value.
For a SELECT or EXISTS operator, return the register that holds the result.
For a TEMP Schema, only the connection mutex is required.
For a UNIQUE index, only conflict if the PRIMARY KEY values of the matched index row are different from the original PRIMARY KEY values of this row before the update.
For a WITHOUT ROWID table, create an ephemeral table used to hold all primary keys for rows to be deleted.
For a ZERODATA table, the pData and nData are both ignored.
For a case-insensitive search, set variable cx to be the same as c but in the other case and search the input string for either c or cx.
For a co-routine, change all OP_Column references to the table of the co-routine into OP_Copy of result contained in a register.
For a cursor with the BTREE_SEEK_EQ hint, only the OP_SeekGE and OP_SeekLE opcodes are allowed, and these must be immediately followed by an OP_IdxGT or OP_IdxLT opcode, respectively, with the same key.
For a detailed discussion of BTrees, refer to  Donald E.
For a docid lookup, this routine simply sets the EOF flag.
For a duplicate or later name, carry on.
For a duplicated named group, OP_DNREF and OP_DNREFI are used.
For a forward assertion, we take the reqchar, if set.
For a full-text query or docid lookup, the statement retrieves a single row by docid.
For a given table, there can be one or more read-only cursors or a single read/write cursor but not both.
For a much better antialiased result, the affine function is recommended.
For a new.rowid reference, p1 is set to (n+1), where n is the number of columns in each pseudo-table.
For a non-purgeable cache (a cache used as the storage for an in-memory database) there is really no difference between createFlag 1 and 2.
For a non-repeating atomic group that includes captures, establish a backup point by processing the rest of the pattern at a lower level.
For a non-repeating ket, just continue at this level.
For a normal halt, this should be SQLITE_OK (0).
For a recursion/subroutine call, if its end has been reached, which implies a backward reference subroutine call, we can scan it.
For a reference to any other column in the new.* pseudo-table, p1 is set to (n+2+i), where n and i are as defined previously.
For a relative children, we're either using alignItems (parent) or alignSelf (child) in order to determine the position in the cross axis
For a repeated Unicode property match, there are two extra bytes that define the required property.
For a rowid table, *piDataCur will be exactly one less than *piIdxCur.
For a rowid table, initialize the RowSet to an empty set
For a sequence of tokens contained in double-quotes (i.e. "one two three") nToken will be the number of tokens in the string.
For a simple insert with data coming from a single-row VALUES clause, the code executes once straight down through.
For a single, positive character, get the value into mcbuffer, and then we can handle this with the normal one-character code.
For a single-column UNIQUE index, once we have found a non-NULL row, we know that all the rest will be distinct, so skip  subsequent distinctness tests.
For a table with implicit rowids, append "old._rowid_" to the list.
For a table with the INTKEY flag set, this routine returns the key itself, not the number of bytes in the key.
For a temporary or in-memory database (neither of which require any locks), this variable is always set to EXCLUSIVE_LOCK.
For a two-way OR, attempt to implementation case 2.
For a user friendly message about environment setup
For a varray this is the maximum length of the array
For added safety, we only leave -_.
For additional information on what it means to "expand" a SELECT statement, see the comment on the selectExpand worker callback above.
For additional information see the documentation on the xClose method of the virtual table interface.
For all aliases with an explicit class name, resolve the class now.
For all dirty pages currently in the cache, invoke the specified callback.
For all other records, zero.
For an ATTACH statement, set P1 to true (expire this statement only).
For an INSERT, the pkChng boolean indicates whether or not the rowid was explicitly specified as part of the INSERT statement.
For an INTKEY table, only the nKey value of the key is used.
For an SQLITE_ACCESS_EXISTS query, treat a zero-length file as if it does not exist.
For an UPDATE operation, this function is called twice.
For an UPDATE, aChange points to an array of size N, where N is the number of columns in table pTab.
For an UPDATE, the pkChng boolean is true if the true primary key (the rowid for a normal table or the PRIMARY KEY for a WITHOUT ROWID table) might be modified by the UPDATE.
For an XCLASS there is always some additional data
For an anchored pattern, or an unanchored pattern that has a first char, or a multiline pattern that matches only at "line starts", there is no point in seeking a list of starting bytes.
For an anchored pattern, we use the "required byte" only if it follows a variable length item in the regex.
For an attached db, it is an error if the encoding is not the same as sqlite3.enc.
For an encrypted database, the situation is more complex:  bytes 24..39 of the database are white noise.
For an error that occurs before that point, jump to error_out.
For an in-memory database, make sure the original page continues to exist, in case the transaction needs to roll back.
For an insert, it must be called once for each token in the new document.
For an internal node, both aDoclist and nDoclist must be passed 0.
For an ordinary non-repeating ket, just continue at this level.
For anchored or unanchored matches, there may be a "last known required character" set.
For any given WHERE  clause, the cursor numbers might not begin with 0 and they might contain gaps in the numbering sequence.
For any other minimum, carrying on will result in NOMATCH.
For anything else, we wrap the entire repeated item inside OP_ONCE brackets.
For anything other than nomatch or partial match, just return the code.
For assigning database names to pTable
For astronomical as well as ceremonial reasons, the start of a new year may be delayed until a day or two after the new moon causing years to vary in length.
For backwards compatibility of the rollback journal file format, we cannot reduce the effective sector size below 512.
For best performance, an attempt is made to guess at the byte-order using C-preprocessor macros.
For binary data it is truncated to fieldsize bytes.
For bitmask tests, testcase() can be used to make sure each bit is significant and used at least once.
For byte_sequence_compare.
For capturing groups we have to check the group number back at the start and if necessary complete handling an extraction by setting the offsets and bumping the high water mark.
For caseless UTF-8 mode when UCP support is available, check whether this character has more than one other case.
For chaining headers.
For char data, the length of the returned string will be longreadlen - 1
For client use (any custom purpose)
For column zero in this document there are two matches at positions 3 and 10 (5-2 and 9-2+3).
For columns use the column name name
For comparing with previous entry
For compatibility reason, implemeted interface is not checked
For compatibility we just ignore this setting.
For compatibility with MS SQL Server
For compatibility with auto-callouts, we allow a callout to be specified before a condition that is an assertion.
For compatibility, we limit the number of captured strings in the same way as pcre_exec(), so that the user gets the same result with and without JIT.
For completeness and backward compatibility, (*UTFn) is supported in the relevant libraries, but (*UTF) is generic and always supported.
For conditions of distribution and use, see the accompanying README file.
For conditions that are assertions, check the syntax, and then exit the switch.
For connection option
For consistency (since sqlite3_step() was called), set the database error in this case as well.
For constraints of the form X IN (...) this routine sets up a loop that will iterate over all values of X.
For convenience, we use the same bit definitions as in chartables: 0x04   decimal digit 0x08   hexadecimal digit Then we can use ctype_digit and ctype_xdigit in the code.
For custom operations on an rbuVfs-file.
For dates outside this range, SQLite attempts to map the year into an equivalent year within this range, do the calculation, then map the year back.
For debugging purposes, record when the mutex subsystem is initialized and uninitialized so that we can assert() if there is an attempt to allocate a mutex while the system is uninitialized.
For debugging use only:
For deletions, we write an empty doclist (varint(docid) varint(POS_END)), for updates we simply write the new doclist.
For descending pending seg-readers only
For description of Comp see Q_Sort.
For detecting the page size.
For digits or letters, do an initial lookup in a table.
For each CTE in the WITH clause....
For each FROM-clause subquery, add Column.zType and Column.zColl information to the Table structure that represents the result set of that subquery.
For each MATCH_ONE, skip one character in the  test string.
For each aggregate function
For each bit set in fixed_bit_masks, what the value is for this instruction.
For each child journal, it checks if:  if the child journal exists, and if so if the child journal contains a reference to master journal  file zMaster  If a child journal can be found that matches both of the criteria above, this function returns without doing anything.
For each codepoint in the zIn/nIn string, this function checks if the sqlite3FtsUnicodeIsalnum() function already returns the desired result.
For each color in colormap, find: 1.
For each color selected by find_nearby_colors, compute its distance to the center of each cell in the box.
For each column to be updated, make sure we have authorization to change that column.
For each column used in source tables
For each column, the number of rows in the table for which the column contains at least one instance of the phrase.
For each cursor required, also allocate a memory cell.
For each entry in the regex array, get the entry
For each entry in the search array, get the entry
For each expression in the list
For each found increment the counter.
For each iteration, variable iOff is set to the byte offset of the destination page.
For each length, check that the remaining bytes start with the 0x80 bit set and not the 0x40 bit.
For each matching starting delimiter, we increment nesting level, and decrement it for each matching ending delimiter.
For each phrase node found, the supplied callback function is invoked.
For each pipe, find an instruction that fits.
For each repetition we must add 1 to the length for BRAZERO and for all but the last repetition we must add 2 + 2*LINKSIZE to allow for the nesting that occurs.
For each row found, increment either the deferred or immediate foreign key constraint counter.
For each row visited, the callback function passed as the fourth argument is invoked.
For each subject entry, convert it to string, then perform replacement and add the result to the return_value array.
For each subpattern, insert it into the appropriate array.
For each subpattern, insert it into the subpatterns array.
For each subsequent  call the nBytes parameter is ignored and a pointer to the same blob of memory returned.
For each subsequent argument, make it a reference, increase refcount, and add it to the end of the array
For each subsequent docid, the varint stored is the difference between the current and previous docid (a positive number - since the list is in ascending order).
For each such table, the iterator visits, in order:  the table itself,  each index of the table (zero or more points to visit), and a special "cleanup table" state.
For each token and indexed token prefix in the document set, a 64-bit checksum is calculated (by code in fts3ChecksumEntry()) based on the following:  + The index number (0 for the main index, 1 for the first prefix index etc.), + The token (or token prefix) text itself,  + The language-id of the row it appears in, + The docid of the row it appears in, + The column it appears in, and + The tokens position within that column.
For each trigger that is not part of the temp-db schema, add a clause to the WHERE  expression being built up in zWhere.
For err msgs.
For errors, it can be some other value.
For every "*" that occurs in the column list, insert the names of all columns in all tables.
For every WHERE clause term that is not used by the index and which has a truth probability assigned by one of the likelihood(), likely(), or unlikely() SQL functions, reduce the estimated number of output rows by the probability specified.
For every character in the password add the entire password.
For example 'inifile' uses this to allow faster access when the key was already found using firstkey/nextkey.
For example if this expression:  ...
For example the  implementation of an SQL aggregate step callback may not use the parameter indicating the number of arguments passed to the aggregate, if it knows that this is enforced elsewhere.
For example those parameters only used in assert() statements.
For example,   fts3PrefixCompress("abc", 3, "abcdef", 6)   // returns 3 fts3PrefixCompress("abX", 3, "abcdef", 6)   // returns 2 fts3PrefixCompress("abX", 3, "Xbcdef", 6)   // returns 0
For example, (E) above is indexable on tables P, Q, and R.
For example, Britain converted in 1752, The USSR in 1918 and Greece in 1923.
For example, a doclist containing (1, -1)  may be smaller than (-1), as in the first example the -1 may be stored as a single-byte delta, whereas in the second it must be stored as a FTS3_VARINT_MAX byte varint.
For example, a log(nRow) factor is omitted from a non-covering index scan in order to bias the scoring in favor of using an index, since the worst-case performance of using an index is far better than the worst-case performance of a full table scan.
For example, an application may allow a user to enter arbitrary SQL queries for evaluation by a database.
For example, an application that does not care about crash recovery or rollback might make the open of a journal file a no-op.
For example, assuming index p is on t1(a, b), and the SQL query is:  ...
For example, assuming that index p is on t1(a):  ...
For example, change "PRIMARY KEY(a,b,a,b,c,b,c,d)" into just "PRIMARY KEY(a,b,c,d)".
For example, consider table t1(a,b,c,d,e,f) with index i1(a,b,c).
For example, each thread requries its own UnpackedRecord object to unpack records in as part of comparison operations.
For example, either of the following:  (bracketed expression) NEAR phrase phrase NEAR (bracketed expression)  Return an error in either case.
For example, if 'X' is a highlighted term and '.' is a non-highlighted term, BestSnippet() may select:  ........X.....X  This function "shifts" the beginning of the snippet forward in the  document so that there are approximately the same number of  non-highlighted terms to the right of the final highlighted term as there are to the left of the first highlighted term.
For example, if a malloc fails while resizing a hash table, this  is completely recoverable simply by not carrying out the resize.
For example, if an IO error occurs while performing a rollback,  the contents of the page-cache may be left in an inconsistent state.
For example, if an exception was thrown in a function and when the function's local variable destruction results in a destructor being called.
For example, if connection X is waiting for connection Y's transaction to be concluded, and similarly connection Y is waiting on connection X's transaction, then neither connection will proceed and the system may remain deadlocked indefinitely.
For example, if new functions or collating sequences are registered or if an authorizer function is added or changed.
For example, if pPhrase refers to the "def ghi" phrase, then *paPoslist points to the position list associated with phrase "abc".
For example, if passed 235 - "LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH DIAERESIS" - return 65 ("LATIN SMALL LETTER E").
For example, if the WHERE clause expression used these VDBE cursors:  4, 5, 8, 29, 57, 73.
For example, if the database file is "/home/user1/config.db" then the file that is created and mmapped for shared memory will be called "/home/user1/config.db-shm".
For example, if the following SQL is executed:  CREATE ..
For example, if the iterator points to a table created as:  CREATE TABLE t1(a, b, c, PRIMARY KEY(b, a DESC)) WITHOUT ROWID  this function returns:  PRIMARY KEY("b", "a" DESC)
For example, if the number of table steps greatly exceeds the number of table searches or result rows, that would tend to indicate that the prepared statement is using a full table scan rather than an index.
For example, if the pending terms hash table contains the terms "sqlite", "mysql" and "firebird", then the iterator visits the following 'terms' (in the order shown):  f fi fir fire fireb firebi firebir firebird m my mys mysq mysql s sq sql sqli sqlit sqlite  Whereas if isPrefixIter is zero, the terms visited are:  firebird mysql sqlite
For example, if the query were:  ...
For example, if the requested column contains "a b X c d X X" and the position-list for 'X' is requested, the buffer returned may contain:  0x04 0x05 0x03 0x01   or   0x04 0x05 0x03 0x00  This function works regardless of whether or not the phrase is deferred, incremental, or neither.
For example, if zType is 'BLOBINT',  SQLITE_AFF_INTEGER is returned.
For example, in the above,  sample 2 is the first sample of a block of N samples, so at first it  appears that it should be 1 field in size.
For example, it might allocate any require mutexes or initialize internal data structures.
For example, quantities 16 and 17 are both represented by a LogEst of 40.
For example, suppose a SrcList initially contains two entries: A,B.
For example, testcase() can be used to make sure boundary values are tested.
For example, the right-most sibling might be completely empty.
For example, the three overflow pages in a chain linked from  the left-most cell of the 450th child of the root page are identified by the paths:  '/1c2/000+000000'         // First page in overflow chain '/1c2/000+000001'         // Second page in overflow chain '/1c2/000+000002'         // Third page in overflow chain  If the paths are sorted using the BINARY collation sequence, then the overflow pages associated with a cell will appear earlier in the sort-order than its child page:  '/1c2/000/'               // Left-most child of 451st child of root
For example, to assemble an RBU enabled VFS stack that uses both zipvfs and  multiplexor (error checking omitted):  Create a VFS named "multiplex" (not the default).
For example, to store the position-list:  4 9 113  the three varints:  6 7 106  are encoded.
For example, when inserting data into a table with auto-generated integer keys, the VDBE layer invokes sqlite3BtreeLast() to figure out the  integer key to use.
For example:
For example:  abc NEAR/5 "def ghi"  Parameter nNear is passed the NEAR distance of the expression (5 in the example above).
For example: "Y collate NOCASE op X" becomes "X op Y" because any collation sequence on the left hand side of a comparison overrides any collation sequence  attached to the right.
For final END opcode
For finder-function F, two objects are created:  (1) The real finder-function named "FImpt()".
For following code (kept for historical record only) shows an unrolling for the 3- and 4-byte varint cases.
For full prefix support, method (3) may be preferred.
For generators though this behavior would be suboptimal, because the (rather large) structure would have to be copied back and forth every time execution is suspended or resumed.
For hard partial matching, we then return immediately.
For help in interpreted the obscure C code in the function definition, see the header comment on the previous function.
For image rotations, the optimized versions have a lazy antialiasing for the edges of the images.
For index b-trees, it is the root page of the associated table.
For index tables, pIdxKey is used and intKey is ignored.
For infix functions (LIKE, GLOB, REGEXP, and MATCH) use the second argument, not the first, as the argument to test to see if it is a column in a virtual table.
For insert, update etc.
For instance while *.txt is a pretty valid filename on EXT3, it's invalid on NTFS.
For instance, it may make more sense to have a 2.5k leaf node rather than splitting into 2k and .5k nodes.
For instance, with 100k docs inserted:  MERGE_COUNT   segments 16           25 8           12 4           10 2            6  This appears to have only a moderate impact on queries for very frequent terms (which are somewhat dominated by segment merge costs), and infrequent and non-existent terms still seem to be fast even with many segments.
For internal nodes it is the node number of a child page.
For iterating through doclist index
For iterating through indexes
For iterators.
For jddayofweek
For jdmonthname
For joins of 3 or more tables, track the 10 best paths
For json_each() path and root are the same so fall through into the root case
For leaf nodes the integer is the rowid of a record.
For leaf pages, the coverage check will occur in the same loop as the other cell checks, so initialize the heap.
For leaf pages, the min-heap has already been initialized and the cells have already been inserted.
For length() and typeof() functions with a column argument, set the P5 parameter to the OP_Column opcode to OPFLAG_LENGTHARG or OPFLAG_TYPEOFARG respectively, to avoid unnecessary data loading.

For many things, we may have leading zeros in a number NUM.
For maximum portability, it is recommended that applications always invoke sqlite3_initialize() directly prior to using any other SQLite interface.
For metasequences that actually match a character, we disable the setting of a first character if it hasn't already been set.
For min() it returns (void *)db, where db is the sqlite3* database pointer.
For mode (1), PGroup.mutex is NULL.
For mode (2) there is only a single PGroup which is the pcache1.grp global variable and its mutex is SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_LRU.

For normal operation N should be 0.
For now, if you're binding output columns, it's better to use LAZY or BOUND fetches if you want to shave off those cycles
For now, it is merely a place-holder.
For now, this only reverts archive comment changes.
For now, this simply calls the internal sqlite3ErrStr() function.

For now, we just bail if we get a mustUnderstand header intended for us.
For now, we return with a failure code to prevent the underlying file's details from being used instead.
For numbers that are too large to represent as a long, this function returns a zero.
For opcode without a special possessified version, wrap the item in ONCE brackets.
For operations where all constraints can be checked before any changes are made to the database, it is never necessary to undo a write and the checkpoint should not be set.

For small tables, the  Hash.ht table is never allocated because if there are few elements in the table, it is faster to do a linear search than to manage the hash table.
For some Windows sub-platforms, the _beginthreadex() / _endthreadex() functions are not available (e.g. those not using MSVC, Cygwin, etc).

For temporary files the effective sector size is always 512 bytes.
For testing
For testing purposes, we can assume that any existential is Any, since we won't be looking at any witness tables that follow the container.
For testing purposes, we sometimes want to preserve the state of PRNG and restore the PRNG to its saved state at a later time, or to reset the PRNG to its initial state.
For testing, remove later.
For text forms, the host parameter index is found by scanning the prepared statement for the corresponding OP_Variable opcode.
For that reason, we always use the nRec value in the header.
For that reason, we will omit this optimization for now.
For the OP_NoConflict opcode, take the jump if any of the input fields are NULL, since any key with a NULL will not conflict
For the SHARED lock, the PENDING will be released.
For the back references, the values are negative the reference number.
For the cross dim, we add both sides at the end because the value is aggregate via a max function.
For the default locale php.ini setting

For the pSelect parameter holds the values to be inserted for the first two forms shown above.
For the purpose of this function, 'word' is defined as a locale dependent string containing alphabetic characters, which also may contain, but not start with "'" and "-" characters.
For the purposes of immediate FK constraints, the OR REPLACE conflict resolution is considered to delete rows before the new row is inserted.
For the purposes of the EP_ConstFunc flag, date and time functions and other functions that change slowly are considered constant because they are constant for the duration of one query
For the purposes of the comparison, ignore the rowid field at the end of each record.
For the purposes of this comparison, EOF is considered greater than any other key value.
For the purposes of this function, a double-quoted string (ex: "abc") is considered a variable but a single-quoted string (ex: 'abc') is a constant.
For the purposes of this routine, a cursor is any cursor that is capable of reading or writing to the database.
For the purposes of this routine, disable the mutex

For this purpose, the lunar cycle is assumed to be 29 days 12 hours and 793 halakim.
For this reason the direct basedir check against the glob query is senseless on windows.
For this reason the prefix is rather better cut off.
For this reason, if an error occurs in the stat() call here, it is ignored and -1 is returned.
For this reason, it is simplest to treat this case separately, as otherwise the code gets far too messy.
For this reason, scoring is designed to pick plans that "do the least harm" if the estimates are inaccurate.
For this reason, the default name prefix is changed to be "sqlite"  spelled backwards.
For this reason, the division that implements of proxy locking is deferred until late in the file (here) after all of the other I/O methods have been defined - so that the primitive locking methods are available as services to help with the implementation of proxy locking.
For this reason, the division that implements proxy locking is located much further down in the file.
For this reason, we cannot store actual data in the bytes used for locking.
For this reason, we need to restore the working value and also the values of the final offsets, in case they were set by a previous iteration of the same bracket.
For this reason, we will put it inside this file after the stop function.
For this reason, xclass gets set TRUE above when uchar_classdata is emptied, and that's why this code is the way it is here instead of just doing a test on class_uchardata below.

For variadic functions any additional (optional) arguments that were added must be checked against the signature of the variadic argument, so in this case we have to go through all the parameters of the function and not just those present in the prototype.
For very long strings (greater than 1GiB) the value returned might be less than the true string length.
For virtual tables, hidden columns are optional - they are updated by RBU if present in the input table, or not otherwise.

Fortunately this doesn't actually matter in practice.
Fortunately this is really a rare case
Fortunately too, there is general agreement that codes 0x00 through 0x3F represent control characters, 0x41 a nonbreaking space, and the remainder printing characters.
Fortunately, SEEK_SET is defined to be zero by the standard.
Fortunately, no need to shift.

Furthermore, because the temporary table has no indices, the WHERE clause on the outer query cannot be optimized.
Furthermore, if database connection db is a zombie (meaning that there has been a prior call to sqlite3_close(db) or sqlite3_close_v2(db)) and every sqlite3_stmt has now been finalized and every sqlite3_backup has finished, then free all resources.
Furthermore, the P3 value must be the same as every other ReopenIdx or OpenRead for the same cursor number.

Hence "Unsafe".
Hence compatible candidate WhereLoops never have a larger rSetup.
Hence for a particular database connection, once malloc starts failing, it fails consistently until mallocFailed is reset.
Hence it has its own case.
Hence it is only available in debug builds.
Hence nBytes is always a non-negative power of two.
Hence nMinMerge.
Hence sqlite3_set_auxdata() should be called near the end of the function implementation and the function implementation should not make any use of P after sqlite3_set_auxdata() has been called.
Hence the RELEASE call below can never fail.
Hence the ROUND8() below.
Hence the default is now to store 32 bits per Long.
Hence the definition of zeroreqchar and zerofirstchar outside the main loop so that they can be accessed for the back off.
Hence the first byte in the returned affinity string in this example would be set to SQLITE_AFF_BLOB.
Hence the name.
Hence the pSpace buffer must be at least 13 bytes in size.
Hence the single variable matchOther is used to store the one we have to look for.
Hence the test for whether or not a character is part of an identifier is 0x46.
Hence these functions allow the caller to handle the serial-type and data blob separately.
Hence use memmove() since memcpy() sends SIGABORT with overlapping buffers on OpenBSD
Hence we limit the maximum size to 0x7fffff00, giving 255 bytes of overhead.
Hence, a false positive (returning TRUE when in fact the expression can never be NULL) might be a small performance hit but is otherwise harmless.
Hence, a mutex on the BtShared should be held prior to calling this routine.
Hence, a negative P2 value is a label that has yet to be resolved.
Hence, a position-list consists of one or more column-lists, a document record consists of a docid followed by a position-list and a doclist consists of one or more document records.
Hence, all bytes of a sector need to be journalled in case of a power loss in the middle of a write.
Hence, fill this column with a NULL to avoid taking up data space with information that will never be used.
Hence, for maximum binary portability you should omit LFS.
Hence, if page 1 appears anywhere on the list, it will be the first page.
Hence, isTnct represents the original setting of the SF_Distinct flag, not the current setting
Hence, schema information cannot be stored in lookaside because in shared cache mode the schema information is shared by multiple database connections.
Hence, temporary disk space that is approximately 2x the size of the original database is required.
Hence, the calling function can deallocate or modify the text after they return without harm.
Hence, the current size of the soft heap limit can be determined by invoking sqlite3_soft_heap_limit64() with a negative argument.
Hence, the locking scheme will support two or more Win95 readers or two or more WinNT readers.
Hence, the primitive operations for a RowSet are:  CREATE INSERT TEST SMALLEST DESTROY  The CREATE and DESTROY primitives are the constructor and destructor, obviously.
Hence, the record number for the table must be allocated now.
Hence, the sqlite3BtreeUpdateMeta() call cannot fail.
Hence, the sqlite_stat4 format will be described first.
Hence, they can always be passed into sqlite3_uri_parameter().
Hence, this block of code must be the very first code in all source files.
Hence, this routine only compares the prefixes  of the keys prior to the final rowid, not the entire key.
Hence, unlike the database and WAL file formats which store all values as big endian, the wal-index can store multi-byte values in the native byte order of the host computer.
Hence, we do not need to hold  locks on the schema, we just need to make sure nobody else is  holding them.
Hence, we issue a warning on sqlite3_log() whenever the capability is used.
Hence, while POWERSAFE_OVERWRITE is on by default, there is a file-control available to turn it off and URI query parameter available to turn it off.

How proxy locking works -----------------------  Proxy file locking relies primarily on two new supporting files:   conch file to limit access to the database file to a single host at a time  proxy file to act as a proxy for the advisory locks normally taken on the database  The conch file - to use a proxy file, sqlite must first "hold the conch" by taking an sqlite-style shared lock on the conch file, reading the contents and comparing the host's unique host ID (see below) and lock proxy path against the values stored in the conch.

However PCRE_G(pcre_cache) must be consistent on the next request as well.
However a comment was received about space saving - maybe the guy linked all the modules rather than using a library - so we include a condition to cut out the tables when not needed.
However according to MSDN, INVALID_SET_FILE_POINTER may also be a valid new offset.
However authinfo and env are cached
However control may currently be delegated to another generator.
However expected is that MINIT is enough in most cases.
However explicitly setting the value to 0 ensures the first value.
However if the application attempts to commit the  transaction before fixing the constraint violation, the attempt fails.
However if this limit is reached midway through a transaction, a new  segment is created and the hash table cleared immediately.
However it does not work out of the box with zipvfs.
However it has been discovered that on some systems this pattern can  be significantly slower than contiguously writing data to the file, even if that means explicitly writing data to the block of  (JOURNAL_HDR_SZ - 28) bytes that will not be used.
However it is important to call sqlite3PagerTruncateImage() here so that any pages in the  destination file that lie beyond the nDestTruncate page mark are journalled by PagerCommitPhaseOne() before they are destroyed by the file truncation.
However it is possible that a script frees descriptors in arbitrary order which would prevent descriptor_count ever being reduced to zero until zend_hash_num_elements() returns 0.
However some might still be in use so even after this clean-up we need to skip entries marked is_deleted.
However such a page may be rolled back as a result of an internal error resulting in an automatic call to sqlite3PagerRollback().
However the ON CONFLICT clauses are different.
However,  Ted Ts'o tells us that fdatasync() will also write the inode if the file size has changed.
However, IE in all it's wisdom always sends the full path of the file on the user's filesystem, which means that unless the user does basename() they get a bogus file name.
However, Perl changed at release 5.18, so PCRE changed at release 8.34.
However, RBU is more efficient if reading the rows in from each data_xxx table in "rowid" order is roughly the same as reading them sorted by the PRIMARY KEY of the corresponding target database table.
However, RMATCH isn't like a function call because it's quite a complicated macro.
However, YYFAIL appears to be in use.
However, a WAL_WRITE_LOCK thread can move the value of nBackfill from mxFrame back to zero when the WAL is reset.
However, a non-prefix query like '1st' will match against "1st" and "first".
However, any backup in progress needs to be restarted.
However, based on certain device characteristics (sector-size and atomic write() support), SQLite may choose a larger value.
However, because extra entries are added to the FTS index, this method uses more space within the database.
However, by keeping a bitmap of the first 31 back references, we can catch some of the more common cases more precisely.
However, conversion tables frequently map 0x00-0x1F to the respective C0 code points.
However, doing that would require us to create an xmlrpc value from the php array, which is rather expensive, especially if it was a big array.
However, don't set the bit unless the length is greater than zero - the interpretive pcre_exec() and pcre_dfa_exec() needn't waste time checking the zero case.
However, due to rounding errors, it may be that the cost of the OR-scan is equal to its most expensive sub-scan.
However, experience has shown that many of these result codes are too coarse-grained.
However, failure to zero-fill short reads will eventually lead to database corruption.
However, for maximum code portability it is recommended that applications still make the distinction between protected and unprotected sqlite3_value objects even when not strictly required.
However, for some POSIX classes (e.g. graph, print, punct) a special property code is compiled directly.
However, if a malloc() failure has occurred since the previous invocation SQLITE_NOMEM is returned instead.
However, if a page is moved to the free-list and then reused within the same transaction, a problem comes up.
However, if frames have been appended to the log (or if the log  is wrapped and written for that matter) before the READ_LOCK(0) is obtained, that is not necessarily true.
However, if neither NUM nor ASSOC is set we will free memory cleanly and won't leak.
However, if no value can be extracted from either pLower or pUpper (and so the estimate of the number of rows delivered remains unchanged), *pbDone is left as is.
However, if op is SAVEPOINT_ROLLBACK, then iSavepoint may also be -1.
However, if the  segment does contain any such terms, they are stored within the identified range.
However, if the -L option is given, set the locale from the LC_xxx environment variables.
However, if the PmaReader.pIncr variable points to an object of the following type, it may be used to iterate/merge through multiple PMAs simultaneously.
However, if the WHERE_SORTBYGROUP flag is also passed to sqlite3WhereBegin(), then this function may be called on the returned WhereInfo object.
However, if the bSpanIsTab flag is set, then zSpan is overloaded to mean the name of the result column in the form: DATABASE.TABLE.COLUMN.
However, if the current transaction has already run one or more incremental-vacuum steps, then the page we are about to allocate may contain content that is required in the event of a rollback.
However, if the database file is being synced as part of a multi-database commit, the argument points to a nul-terminated string containing the transactions master-journal file name.
However, if the first docid copied to the output is a negative number, then the encoding of the first docid from the 'other' input list may be larger in the output than it was in the input (since the delta value may be a larger positive integer than the actual docid).
However, if the group was entered as a result of checking a previous iterator, this is not possible.
However, if the magic number is equal to REVERSED_MAGIC_NUMBER we return with PCRE_ERROR_BADENDIANNESS, which means that the pattern is likely compiled with different endianness.
However, if the number of possible capturing brackets is small, use a block of store on the stack, to reduce the use of malloc/free.
However, if the referenced string is the empty string, always treat it as matched, any number of times (otherwise there could be infinite loops).
However, if the second argument is non-zero then this b-tree transaction is part of a multi-file  transaction.
However, if the value passed as argument nField is non-zero and the sorter is able to guarantee a stable sort, nField is used instead.
However, if this is a subquery within an expression, sqlite3ResolveExprNames() will be called without a prior call to sqlite3SelectExpand().
However, if this position-list was edited in place by fts3EvalNearTrim(), then pIter may not actually point to the start of the next docid value.
However, if we end up without a first char setting for an unanchored pattern, it is worth scanning the regex to see if there is an initial asserted first char.
However, if we have already added a sample that shares this prefix, there is no need to add this one.
However, in JavaScript compatibility mode, the length passed is zero.
However, in Perl's warning mode, a warning is given, so PCRE now faults it as it is almost certainly a mistake on the user's part.
However, in both cases the category contains more characters than the specials that are defined for the property being tested against.
However, in future that may change, so we include them here so as not to leave a gotcha for a future maintainer.
However, in order to accommodate the version of this code that uses an external "stack" implemented on the heap, it is easier to declare them all here, so the declarations can be cut out in a block.
However, in the pre-compile phase, class_uchardata gets emptied to prevent workspace overflow, so it only if the very last character in the class needs XCLASS will it contain anything at this point.
However, in this case, data is read from the sqlite_stat1 table (if it is present) before returning.
However, it calls memory allocation and freeing functions via the four indirections below, and it can optionally do callouts, using the fifth indirection.
However, it does not support prefix queries very well.
However, it is also included in the compilation of dftables.c, in which case the macro DFTABLES is defined.
However, it is created first, so we have to allow memory for it.
However, it is not identical.
However, it is sometimes set to 1 instead of 0 as a hint to the command-line shell that this Goto is the bottom of a loop and that the lines from P2 down to the current line should be indented for EXPLAIN output.
However, it seems that this can be very slow on some operating systems.
However, it won't be unregistered until the script ends.
However, many of the "procedures" and "functions" for modifying and accessing this structure are really macros, so we can't really make this structure opaque.
However, new applications should avoid the use of these functions.
However, normally we don't expect an error message, thus we continue.
However, now that there is the possiblity of (*THEN) occurring in the final alternative, this optimization is no longer always possible.
However, on FreeBSD, avoiding longjmp() more than halves the time taken to run the standard tests.
However, pReadr itself is not set up to point to its first key.
However, php_url_scanner_reset_vars() resets all vars including other URL rewrites set by elsewhere.
However, since LogEst quantities are suppose to be estimates, not exact values, this imprecision is not a problem.
However, since this content is not present in either the database file or the portion of the rollback journal and  sub-journal rolled back the content could not be restored and the database image would become corrupt.
However, some of the "procedures" and "functions" for modifying and accessing this structure are really macros, so we can't really make this structure opaque.
However, sometimes a fault is not necessarily fatal.
However, such calls must not close the database connection nor finalize or reset the prepared statement in which the function is running.
However, that choice is controversial since technically the underlying file system does not always provide powersafe overwrites.
However, that integer is too large to be stored in a 2-byte unsigned integer, so a value of 0 is used in its place.
However, that leads to a large number of relocations when a shared library is dynamically loaded.
However, that optimization precluded other useful optimizations (such as merging color conversion with upsampling) and it also interfered with desired capabilities such as quantizing to an externally-supplied colormap.
However, that would make it  smaller than sample 1, so the binary search would not work.
However, that's not true, as if max_allowed_packet_size is smaller than the chunk being sent to the server, the latter will complain with an error message.
However, the MSDN docs state that there is a flags parameter, and my VC6 won't link unless the code uses the version with 4 parameters.
However, the bit map we are constructing is for byte values.
However, the format of 5-byte and 6-byte characters is still checked.
However, the functions and classes exported by the module will not be available until the module is 'reloaded'.
However, the list is correct for canonical LR with one exception: it will still contain any token that will not be accepted due to an error action in a later state.
However, the matching is different.
However, the resulting error message is misleading if the real problem is an empty input file, so we handle that case specially.
However, the signature of the callback function allows SQLite to pass it an array of void* context pointers.
However, the sqlite3_backup_remaining() and sqlite3_backup_pagecount() APIs are not strictly speaking threadsafe.
However, the syntax has been checked to ensure that the ...
However, there is an option that disables these, for testing and for ensuring that all callouts do actually occur.
However, these are (possibly recursive) subroutine calls, _not_ backreferences.
However, these macros may also be used to suppress warnings related to parameters that may or may not be used depending on compilation options.
However, this can be changed by setting the PCRE_UCP option.
However, this can happen only at top level - if we are within parentheses, the starting BRA will still be present.
However, this function just burn CPU cycles if the stack is large enough.
However, this is not permitted in this case.
However, this uses a lot more stack, so in 8.20, atomic groups that do not contain any captures generate OP_ONCE_NC, which can be handled in the old, less stack intensive way.
However, we assume that any slots written before the current read transaction was opened remain unmodified.
However, we assume that what we are passed is a compiled regex.
However, we can give a message for this error
However, we cannot do this when the assertion contains subroutine calls, because they can be forward references.
However, we do need to adjust any OP_RECURSE calls inside the group that refer to the group itself or any internal or forward referenced group, because the offset is from the start of the whole regex.
However, we do the appropriate tests here so that overlong sequences get diagnosed, and also in case there is ever an option for handling these larger code points.
However, we may need to convert the string containing its name into UTF-8 (i.e. if it is UTF-16 right now).
However, we still need some kind of function implementation for this routines in the function table.
However, we want to be able to timeout any user-supplied shutdown functions, so pretend we are not in a signal handler while we are calling these
However, we want to make sure that the insteadof declaration is consistent in itself.
However, when a group is optional (i.e. the minimum quantifier is zero), OP_BRAZERO or OP_SKIPZERO is inserted before it, after it has been compiled.
However, when a metadata call is done, we need to calculate max_length.
However, when moving a malformed cell from a leaf page to an interior page, if the cell size wanted to be less than 4 but got rounded up to 4 on the leaf, then size might be less than 8 (leaf-size + pointer) on the interior node.
However, with the change of recursive back references to be atomic, we have to look for the number so that this state can be identified, as otherwise the incorrect length is computed.
However, you don't know it in advance, so it must always be called.

I don't return dbprtype(type) because it does not fully describe the type (example: varchar is reported as char by dbprtype)  FIX ME: Cache datatypes from server systypes table in pdo_dblib_handle_factory() to make this future proof.
I doubt that "lint" will like this much.
I exclude vertical tab because it never seems to be used in real text.
I have chosen to use the spellings found in the Encyclopedia Judaica.
I have given them names, to make them stand out more clearly.
I have yet to find a specific date when the current set of rules were known to be in use.
I include bell because some programs (particularly shell scripts) use it literally, even though it is rare in normal text.
I only describe the parts that I am sure about.
I opted to disallow the characters that would result in a parse error when preprocessing of the input stream.
I probably could have just used strlen...
I really hate select().
I simply fixed things to get them working for now.
I still use the compareAndSwap to assert this invariant though.
I suppose I could have been using a character pointer instead of accesssing the array directly...
I suspect that if we ordered the doclists by size and flushed the largest until the buffer was half empty, that would let the less frequent terms generate longer doclists.
I think encoding and options should be arguments of this function.
I think that SetStmtOption is of little use, since most of those can only be specified before preparing/executing statements.
I think that the description in 'asdef' is out of date.
I think this is a bad design in general even if it has some reasons.
I very much doubt you can see it.
I was writing for Unix, so I just let it call itself recursively.
I would appreciate it if you give credit where it is due and keep your modifications in the public domain as well, but I don't require that in order to let you place this code and any modifications you make under a license of your choice.
I would have expected the second lock to fail since there was already a lock on the file due to fd1.
I would support a wider range of dates, but I have not been able to find an authoritative definition of when leap years were to have occurred.
I'll fix it when I decied how to support user defined types.
I'll opt to apply to XHTML 1.0 the same rules as for XML 1.0.
I'm assuming a chord-rule at the moment.
I'm guessing that isn't likely to happen, but by using the same locking range we are at least open to the possibility.
I'm leaving it in place for people who can live with the limitations, which I only found out about after I had implemented it anyway.
I'm not sure what there parser is doing to make this happen.
I've also made it reentrant and made a number of other changes.
I've generalized GMST0 as well, and define it
I've reviewed the changes made in OpenBSD (as of 2.7) and modified the original code in a similar way where applicable.
I) The global storage.
I.2) For each FK for which the table is the parent table,  search the child table for rows that correspond to the new row in the parent table.
I.e., the caller must still be able to filter directories out.
I.e.: unused literals can belong to branches, which can be encoded as B or BL.

IMPLEMENTATION-OF: R-00140-37445 SQLite automatically serializes calls to the xInit method, so the xInit method need not be threadsafe.
IMPLEMENTATION-OF: R-07677-41881 If the largest ROWID is equal to the largest possible integer (9223372036854775807) then the database engine starts picking positive candidate ROWIDs at random until it finds one that is not previously used.
IMPLEMENTATION-OF: R-12238-55120 Whenever a PRAGMA statement is parsed, an SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA file control is sent to the open sqlite3_file object corresponding to the database file to which the pragma statement refers.
IMPLEMENTATION-OF: R-20790-14025 The sqlite3_threadsafe() function returns zero if and only if SQLite was compiled with mutexing code omitted due to the SQLITE_THREADSAFE compile-time option being set to 0.
IMPLEMENTATION-OF: R-26000-56589 The xShutdown() method may be NULL.
IMPLEMENTATION-OF: R-26801-64137 If the xInit() method is NULL, then the built-in default page cache is used instead of the application defined page cache.
IMPLEMENTATION-OF: R-29875-31678 The argument to the SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA file control is an array of pointers to strings (char**) in which the second element of the array is the name of the pragma and the third element is the argument to the pragma or NULL if the pragma has no argument.
IMPLEMENTATION-OF: R-30243-02494 The sqlite3_stricmp() and sqlite3_strnicmp() APIs allow applications and extensions to compare the contents of two buffers containing UTF-8 strings in a case-independent fashion, using the same definition of "case independence" that SQLite uses internally when comparing identifiers.
IMPLEMENTATION-OF: R-31093-59126 The default suggested cache size is 2000 pages.
IMPLEMENTATION-OF: R-34391-24921 The sqlite3_release_memory() routine is a no-op returning zero if SQLite is not compiled with SQLITE_ENABLE_MEMORY_MANAGEMENT.
IMPLEMENTATION-OF: R-35210-63508 The sqlite3_libversion_number() function returns an integer equal to SQLITE_VERSION_NUMBER.
IMPLEMENTATION-OF: R-42059-47211 If the argument N is positive then the suggested cache size is set to N.
IMPLEMENTATION-OF: R-44699-57140 This mode works the same way as SQLITE_CHECKPOINT_RESTART with the addition that it also truncates the log file to zero bytes just prior to a successful return.
IMPLEMENTATION-OF: R-46199-30249 SQLite guarantees that the second argument to xRealloc is always a value returned by a prior call to xRoundup.
IMPLEMENTATION-OF: R-46798-50301 The sqlite3_context_db_handle() interface returns a copy of the pointer to the database connection (the 1st parameter) of the sqlite3_create_function() and sqlite3_create_function16() routines that originally registered the application defined function.
IMPLEMENTATION-OF: R-48205-43578 The default suggested cache size can be altered using the SQLITE_DEFAULT_CACHE_SIZE compile-time options.
IMPLEMENTATION-OF: R-48440-37595 If the specific value bound to host parameter in the WHERE clause might influence the choice of query plan for a statement, then the statement will be automatically recompiled, as if there had been a schema change, on the first sqlite3_step() call following any change to the bindings of that parameter.
IMPLEMENTATION-OF: R-49045-42493 SQLite will use the xCurrentTimeInt64() method to get the current date and time if that method is available (if iVersion is 2 or greater and the function pointer is not NULL) and will fall back to xCurrentTime() if xCurrentTimeInt64() is unavailable.
IMPLEMENTATION-OF: R-57228-12904 Invoking sqlite3_finalize() on a NULL pointer is a harmless no-op.
IMPLEMENTATION-OF: R-59782-36818 The SQLITE_CHECKPOINT_FULL, RESTART and TRUNCATE modes also obtain the exclusive "writer" lock on the database file.
IMPLEMENTATION-OF: R-61436-13639 If the argument N is negative, then the number of cache pages is adjusted to use approximately abs(N*1024) bytes of memory.
IMPLEMENTATION-OF: R-62028-47212 All calls obtain an exclusive  "checkpoint" lock on the database file.
IMPLEMENTATION-OF: R-63124-39300 The sqlite3_sourceid() function returns a pointer to a string constant whose value is the same as the SQLITE_SOURCE_ID C preprocessor macro.
IMPLEMENTATION-OF: R-64451-07163 The soft_heap_limit pragma always returns the same integer that would be returned by the sqlite3_soft_heap_limit64(-1) C-language function.

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR ZIPVFS USERS: The RBU extension works with all of SQLite's built-in VFSs, including the multiplexor VFS.
IMPORTANT:  Changing the PENDING byte from 0x40000000 results in an incompatible database file format.
IMPORTANT: On some systems it is required that RESBUF is correctly aligned for a 32 bits value.

If  WHERE_ONETABLE_ONLY is set, iIdxCur is the cursor number of an index to use for OR clause processing.
If  all function arguments are SQL literals, one of the SQLITE_FUNC_CONSTANT or _SLOCHNG function flags is set, and the SQLITE_FUNC_NEEDCOLL function flag is not set,  then this routine attempts to invoke the SQL function.
If  an error has already occurred when this function is called, it is a no-op.
If  an error occurs while running the checkpoint, an SQLite error code is  returned (i.e. SQLITE_IOERR).
If  any are, then the constraint is considered satisfied.
If  argument bNC is true, then the SQLITE_FUNC_NEEDCOLL flag is set.
If  bExtend is non-zero and the requested shared-memory region has not yet  been allocated, it is allocated by this function.
If  malloc() has failed, the threads mallocFailed flag is cleared and the result code of statement pStmt set to SQLITE_NOMEM.
If  pnToken is not NULL, then it is set to the number of tokens in all matchable phrases of the expression.
If  this call returns SQLITE_NOTFOUND, then the RBU vfs is not in use.
If "hitend" is set afterwards, remember the first starting point for which a partial match was found.
If "mimetype" is non-NULL, it should point to a pointer allocated with emalloc().
If "previous" is set and it is not at the start of the work space, move it back to there, in order to avoid filling up the work space.
If * further matching is needed, it will be done below.
If *pArg is initially negative then this is a query.
If *pMonth is 13, the SDN represents one of the holidays at the end of the year and pDay will be in the range 1 to 6 inclusive.
If *pPgno refers to a pointer-map page, allocate two new pages at the end of the file instead of one.
If *pRC is initially non-zero (non-SQLITE_OK) then this routine is a no-op.
If *pRc is initially non-zero then this routine is a no-op.
If *pRc is non-zero when this function is called, it is a no-op.
If *pRc is not SQLITE_OK when this function is called, it immediately returns 0.
If *pRc is not SQLITE_OK when this function is called, it is a no-op (and a NULL pointer is returned).
If *pRc is not SQLITE_OK when this function is called, it is a no-op.
If *pRc is not SQLITE_OK when this function is called, then no attempt is made to write any data to disk.
If *pRc is not SQLITE_OK, or if pExpr is not the root node of a NEAR cluster, then this function returns 1 immediately.
If *pRc is other than SQLITE_OK when this function is called, it is a no-op (NULL is returned).
If *pRc is other than SQLITE_OK when this function is called, it is a no-op.
If *pRc is set to any value other than SQLITE_OK when this function is  called, it is a no-op.
If *pbFirst is non-zero when this function is called, then the value  written is either (iVal-*piPrev) (if bDescIdx is zero) or (*piPrev-iVal) (if bDescIdx is non-zero).
If *pbFirst is zero when this function is called, the value written to the buffer is that of parameter iVal.
If *piPartIdxLabel is not NULL, fill it in with a label and jump to that label if pIdx is a partial index that should be skipped.
If *pp does not being with a decimal digit SQLITE_ERROR is returned and the output value undefined.
If *pp does not point to or past pEnd, then a single varint is read from *pp.
If *pp points past the end of the current position-list, set *pi to  POSITION_LIST_END and return.
If *pp1 is exactly nTokens before *pp2
If *ppVal is initially NULL then a new sqlite3_value object is allocated.
If *ppVal is initially NULL then the caller is responsible for  ensuring that the value written into *ppVal is eventually freed.
If *target is NULL determine required destination buffer size (pre-flighting).
If -1 is returned, the buffer is left in an  undefined state.
If -s has been specified, treat character special files like ordinary files.
If 1, the new.* table.
If 2nd param is NULL, use internal row counter to access next row
If AUTOVACUUM is disabled then a zero is stored in register P2.
If AUTOVACUUM is enabled and the page at iTable is not the last root page in the database file, then the last root page  in the database file is moved into the slot formerly occupied by iTable and that last slot formerly occupied by the last root page is added to the freelist instead of iTable.
If AUTOVACUUM is enabled then it is possible that another root page might be moved into the newly deleted root page in order to keep all root pages contiguous at the beginning of the database.
If B is less than the amount of data that will fit on a single leaf page of an intkey table in this database, then the average docsize is 1.
If C is defined then so is B.
If CollSeq.xCmp is NULL, it means that the collating sequence is undefined.
If EP_FromJoin, the right table of the join
If EXPR is -1 or 0 or 1, then maybe the "x" column is boolean or else -1 or 0 or 1 is a common default value on the "x" column and so in that case only cap the output row estimate at 1/2 instead of 1/4.
If F is a NULL pointer, then sqlite3_uri_parameter(F,P) returns NULL and sqlite3_uri_boolean(F,P,B) returns B.
If F is not a NULL pointer and is not a database file pathname pointer that SQLite passed into the xOpen VFS method, then the behavior of this routine is undefined and probably undesirable.
If FTS_LOG_MERGES is defined, call sqlite3_log() to report each automatic and incremental merge operation that takes place.
If Fts3Cursor.pMIBuffer is NULL, then this is the first time the matchinfo function has been called for this query.
If Fts3Expr.eType is FTSQUERY_PHRASE and isLoaded is true, then aDoclist  points to a malloced buffer, size nDoclist bytes, containing the results  of this phrase query in FTS3 doclist format.
If HAVING is present but there is no ORDER BY, we will get an error.
If I add more options, it would make sense to create a nice static struct and loop over it.
If JIT support was compiled and requested, attempt the JIT compilation.
If JOURNAL_HDR_SZ bytes cannot be read from the journal file an error code is returned.
If JSON or PATH is malformed, throw an error.
If LcsIterator.iCol is set to the following value, the iterator has finished iterating through all offsets for all columns.
If MALLOC is undefined, malloc will be invoked directly -- and assumed always to succeed.
If MATCH_SKIP_ARG reaches this level it means that a MARK that matched the SKIP's arg was not found.
If N is exceeds the number of available subterms, return NULL.
If N is larger than the minimum, use the surplus as an initial allocation of entries available to be filled.
If N is negative, then the default memory map limit determined by sqlite3_config(SQLITE_CONFIG_MMAP_SIZE) is set.
If N is negative, then the number of pages is adjusted so that the cache uses -N kibibytes of memory.
If N is out of range, return 0.
If N is out of range, return a NULL pointer.
If N is positive then that is the number of pages in the cache.
If N is positive, then N pages worth of memory are allocated using a single sqlite3Malloc() call and that memory is used for the first N pages allocated.
If NOMEM is returned, then the encoding of the value may not have changed.
If NO_EMPTY flag is set
If NULL is given the subject is set to "No Subject" 3) mailTo:  Destination address 4) data:        Null terminated string containing the data to be send.
If NULL is passed to this function, we assume a malloc() failed during sqlite3_open().
If NULL is returned, session module create new ID by using php_session_create_id().
If NULL use PRIMARY KEY
If NULL, then tracing is turned off.
If NULL, use the default
If OCIPing returns ORA-1010 (invalid OCI operation) such as from Pre-10.1 servers, the error is still from the server and we would have successfully performed a roundtrip and validated the connection.
If OMIT_TRIGGER is defined but OMIT_FOREIGN_KEY is not, only some of the functions are no-oped.
If ORDER BY makes no difference in the output then neither does DISTINCT so it can be removed too.
If P is a query parameter of F has no explicit value, then sqlite3_uri_parameter(F,P) returns a pointer to an empty string.
If P1  does contain an entry whose prefix matches the P3/P4 record then control falls through to the next instruction and P1 is left pointing at the matching entry.
If P1 does contain a record with rowid P3 then  leave the cursor pointing at that record and fall through to the next instruction.
If P1 does not contain a record with rowid P3 then jump immediately to P2.
If P1 holds a NULL then store a NULL in P2.
If P1 is 0, then all SQL statements become expired.
If P1 is non-zero, the database constraint counter is incremented  (deferred foreign key constraints).
If P1 is non-zero, then only the currently executing statement is expired.
If P1 is non-zero, then the jump is taken if the database constraint-counter is zero (the one that counts deferred constraint violations).
If P1 is not currently open, this instruction is a no-op.
If P1 is not open then the behavior is undefined.
If P1 is not zero, then it is a register that a subsequent min() or max() aggregate will set to 1 if the current row is not the minimum or maximum.
If P1 is zero, the jump is taken if the statement constraint-counter is zero (immediate foreign key constraint violations).
If P2 is 0 or if the table or index is not empty, fall through to the following instruction.
If P2 is non-zero, then a write-transaction is started, or if a  read-transaction is already active, it is upgraded to a write-transaction.
If P2 is not zero, jump to instruction P2.
If P2 is true, roll back any currently active btree transactions.
If P2 is zero, then a read-transaction is started.
If P3 greater than P2, then also write NULL into register P3 and every register in between P2 and P3.
If P3 is greater than zero, then the value stored in register P3 is also incremented by the number of rows in the table being cleared.
If P3 is less than P2 (typically P3 is zero) then only register P2 is set to NULL.
If P4 is NULL then all index fields have the affinity BLOB.
If P4 is not NULL then the P1 cursor must have been positioned using OP_NotFound prior to invoking this opcode.
If P4 is not NULL, it points to a KeyInfo structure that defines the format of keys in the index.
If P4 is not NULL, then it is the name of the table that P1 is pointing to.
If P4 is not null then it is an error message string.
If P4 is not specified then memcmp() is used to compare text string.
If P5 has the OPFLAG_NCHANGE bit set, then the change counter is incremented by this instruction.
If P5 has the OPFLAG_PERMUTE bit set, then the order of comparison is determined by the most recent OP_Permutation operator.
If P5 has the OPFLAG_USESEEKRESULT bit set, then the cursor must have just done a seek to the spot where the new entry is to be inserted.
If P5 is non-zero, then recursive program invocation is enabled.
If P5 is not zero, the check is done on the auxiliary database file, not the main database file.
If P5 is positive and the jump is taken, then event counter number P5-1 in the prepared statement is incremented.
If P5 is zero, then the cursor is left in an undefined state.
If PATH already exists, this routine is a no-op.
If PATH does not already exist, this routine is a no-op.
If PCRE is configured with --enable-rebuild-chartables, this happens automatically.
If PCRE_FIRSTLINE is set, the match must happen before or at the first newline in the subject (though it may continue over the newline).
If PCRE_JAVASCRIPT_COMPAT is set, a backreference to an unset bracket matches an empty string (by default it causes a matching failure), so in that case we must set the minimum length to zero.
If PCRE_NEVER_UTF is set, remember it.
If PRNG_SAVE has never before been called, then this verb acts like PRNG_RESET.
If Pager.errCode is set, the contents of the pager cache cannot be trusted.
If Pager.journalSizeLimit is set to a positive, non-zero value, and following the truncation or zeroing described above the size of the  journal file in bytes is larger than this value, then truncate the journal file to Pager.journalSizeLimit bytes.
If PagerSavepoint.iHdrOffset is not zero, then pages are played back starting from the journal header immediately following  PagerSavepoint.iHdrOffset to the end of the main journal file.
If QUALITY is in the range 0-100, increasing values represent higher quality but also larger image size.
If QUALITY is negative, the IJG JPEG library's default quality is used (which should be near optimal for many applications).

If REQUEST_BODY_FILE variable not available - read post body from fastcgi stream
If RESTRICT, "SELECT RAISE(...)"
If SAPI does not want to ignore all ini files OR an overriding file/path is given.

If SNI is explicitly disabled we're finished here
If SPACE is non-zero, we must output one space before the number.

If SQLITE_IOCAP_POWERSAFE_OVERWRITE is defined, then padding is not needed and only the sync is done.
If SQLITE_MALLOC_SOFT_LIMIT is not zero, then try to keep the sizes of memory allocations below this value where possible.
If SQLITE_NULLEQ is set (which will only happen if the operator is OP_Eq or OP_Ne) then take the jump or not depending on whether or not both operands are null.
If SQLITE_NULLEQ is set in P5 then the result of comparison is always either true or false and is never NULL.
If SQLITE_OK is returned, it means that access is allowed.
If SQLITE_OK is returned, the caller is responsible for closing the file descriptor *pFd using close().

If SUBSTR_COMPATIBILITY is defined then substr(X,0,N) work the same as as substr(X,1,N) - it returns the first N characters of X.
If TEMP was specified, then the trigger name may not be qualified.
If TRUE is returned, also set *piCur to the cursor number of the table that is indexed and *piColumn to the column number of the column that is indexed, or -2 if an expression is being indexed.

If WHERE_ONETABLE_ONLY is set, index cursor number
If X and Y are NULL (in other words if only the column name Z is supplied) and the value of Z is enclosed in double-quotes, then Z is a string literal if it doesn't match any column names.
If X is a character that can be used in an identifier then IdChar(X) will be true.
If X is a proper subset of Y then Y is a better choice and ought to have a lower cost.
If X is false and assert() is disabled, then the return value is zero.
If X is false and assert() is enabled, then the assertion fires and the process aborts.
If X is not the INTEGER PRIMARY KEY then X must be compatible with index pIdx.
If X is true and assert() is disabled, then the return value is zero.
If X is true and assert() is enabled, then the return value is true.
If X points to something that is not the beginning of memory allocation, or if it points to a formerly valid memory allocation that has now been freed, then the behavior of sqlite3_msize(X) is undefined and possibly harmful.
If YYTABLE_NINF, syntax error.
If `WriteFail` fails, that's probably because the pipe is full, or closed.
If a  deferred foreign key constraint is violated, no action is taken  immediately.

If a column is marked as 'hidden' (currently only possible for virtual tables), do not include it in the expanded result-set list.
If a conditional group has only one branch, there is a second, implied, empty branch, so just skip over the conditional, because it could be empty.
If a connect on a existing handle is performed and mysql_flags is passed which doesn't CLIENT_COMPRESS, then we need to overwrite the value which we set based on saved_compression.

If a journal file does not contain a master-journal pointer, it is finalized by overwriting the first journal header with zeroes.
If a journal file exists, and there is no RESERVED lock on the database file, then it either needs to be played back or deleted.
If a journal-header is written into the main journal while the savepoint is active, then iHdrOffset is set to the byte offset  immediately following the last journal record written into the main journal before the journal-header.
If a malloc fails, then the new data is returned and the hash table is unchanged.
If a malloc fails, this function may return NULL.
If a malloc() failure occurred in sqlite3HashInsert(), it will  return the pColl pointer to be deleted (because it wasn't added to the hash table).
If a master  journal file name has already been written to the journal file,  or if zMaster is NULL (no master journal), then this call is a no-op.
If a master journal file name is present at the end of the journal file, then it is copied into the buffer pointed to by zMaster.
If a master journal file name is specified, but the file is not present on disk, then the journal is not hot and does not need to be played back.

If iUseFlag is less than or equal to zero, the subroutine is a no-op.
If in WRITER_DBMOD, WRITER_FINISHED or OPEN state, then we update the pager cache if it exists and the main file.
If in doubt, do not deviate from existing commenting and indentation practices when changing or adding code.
If in full-sync mode, advance to the next disk sector before writing the master journal name.
If in full-synchronous mode, sync the journal first.
If in the future we call sqlite3PagerWrite() on this page, that means we have started to be concerned about content and the disk read should occur at that point.
If in the ranges below, it represents necessarily a alpha character because none of the supported encodings has an overlap with ASCII in the leading byte (only on the second one)
If in/out parameter (*pRc) is set to other than SQLITE_OK when this function is called, it is a no-op.

If input table has column "rbu_rowid"
If insufficient space is available, return NULL.
If is OK to return 0 here even if the expression really is always false or false (a false negative).
If isIgnoreErrors is true, then a table is being dropped.
If isWrite is non-zero and the requested shared-memory region has not yet been allocated, it is allocated by this function.
If isWrite is set to zero, exit early.
If it actually is this, return a pointer to the ')'.
If it can be used, then the value returned is the size of the journal file when it contains rollback data for exactly one page.
If it can't find anything, we have to give up.
If it can, create one if one does not already exist.
If it can, the merge-writer object *pWriter is initialized to write to it.
If it cannot (because  the page needs to be defragmented before the cells will fit), non-zero is returned.
If it could, we must look outwards for branches at other levels, stopping when we pass beyond the bracket which is the subject of the recursion.
If it did not delete it, the row-trigger may still have modified  some of the columns of the row being updated.
If it does fail, simply leak the file descriptor, but do log the error.

If it does, record the new maximum blob size.
If it does, return early without loading the doclist-index (as it belongs to a different term.
If it does, then that is what is used.
If it does, this  indicates that the other process is not following the locking protocol.
If it does, we'd probably end up annihilating a positive+negative pi assertion.
If it evaluates to false (or NULL) the sub-vdbe is immediately halted by jumping to the  OP_Halt inserted at the end of the program.
If it exists, we pass the data immediately back to the caller.
If it fails here, it surely means that the user running this process does not have the permission(s) to use this container.
If it fails then it tries to glob the rest of the pattern and returns.
If it fails, we do not change the array.
If it fails, we return uninitialized.
If it finds some mandatory character(s), we are done for this branch.
If it finds that one of the recursions in the current group is on this list, it does not adjust the value in the reference (which is a group number).
If it has multiple other cases, return its case offset value.
If it has not already been allocated, allocate the UnpackedRecord structure that  that function will return to its caller here.
If it has not already been created, create the rbu_state table
If it has, return early.
If it is 0, then the mask returned applies to the old.* table.
If it is END it's the end of the outer call.
If it is NULL and a value can be successfully extracted, a new UnpackedRecord is allocated (and *ppRec set to point to it) before returning.

If it is left  pointing at the next record, then the next Next instruction will be a  no-op.
If it is modified, this value is restored before this  function returns.
If it is non-zero, then the cursor  is left in a state such that the next call to BtreeNext() or BtreePrev() moves it to the same row as it would if the call to BtreeDelete() had been omitted.
If it is not NULL, it points to an array of size nCol*3, where nCol is the number of columns in the queried FTS table.
If it is not NULL, pTerm is a term that provides an upper or lower bound on a range scan.
If it is not NULL, the xSelectCallback() callback is invoked before the walk of the expressions and FROM clause.
If it is not NULL, then all entries in the sqlite_statN tables associated with the named table are deleted.

If it is the year following a leap year and the molad occurs on Monday at or after 9:32:43 and 1/3 sec, Tishri 1 must be delayed.
If it is true, the value read is subtracted from *pVal before this  function returns.
If it is true, the work of updating the change-counter is omitted for the current transaction.
If it is we must truncate.
If it is within the current branch, and the branch is one of two or more alternatives (it either starts or ends with OP_ALT), we have reached the limit of THEN's action, so convert the return code to NOMATCH, which will cause normal backtracking to happen from now on.

If it was a capturing subpattern, check to see if it contained any recursive back references.
If it was compressed, then the fp does not refer to the original file
If it were possible, this block would have to account for hidden column.
If it were, another process might open the database file, detect the RESERVED lock, and conclude that the database is safe to read while this process is still rolling the  hot-journal back.
If it were, that could cause a problem.
If it will not fit, then make a copy of the cell content into pTemp if pTemp is not null.
If it's ALT it is an alternation in a nested call.

If maximizing, find the longest string and work backwards
If maximizing, it is worth using inline code for speed, doing the type test once at the start (i.e. keep it out of the loop).
If memory status is enabled, then the malloc.c wrapper will already hold the STATIC_MEM mutex when the routines here are invoked.
If memory was allocated specifically to the page cache using SQLITE_CONFIG_PAGECACHE but that memory has all been used, then it is desirable to avoid allocating a new page cache entry because presumably SQLITE_CONFIG_PAGECACHE was suppose to be sufficient for all page cache needs and we should not need to spill the allocation onto the heap.

If nLoop is zero, then there are no FROM terms in the query.
If nRec is 0 and this rollback is of a transaction created by this process and if this is the final header in the journal, then it means that this part of the journal was being filled but has not yet been synced to disk.

If not, we broke out after a match.
If not, we return a non-zero value.
If not, we still carry on, because there may be ranges that start below 256 in the additional data.
If nothing is set at run time, whatever was used at compile time applies.
If obtaining a child page for a cursor, we must verify that the page is compatible with the root page.
If oci_old_close_semantics is set, we artificially bump up the refcount and decremented only at request shutdown.
If offset before start
If offset is greater than offset_top, it means that we are "skipping" a capturing group, and that group's offsets must be marked unset.
If offsets should be captured

If one of the substrings is found, the corresponding affinity is returned.
If one of these fault codes is received, the description string will automatically be prefixed with a standard error string and 2 newlines.
If one or more IN operators appear, then this routine allocates an additional nEq memory cells for internal use.
If one or more segments are promoted, the structure object is updated to reflect this.
If one side or the other of the AND is known to be false, then instead of returning an AND expression, just return a constant expression with a value of false.

If p1 is at EOF
If p2 is at EOF
If p2 is negative, return the p2 characters preceding p1.
If pAlloc is not NULL, then an UnpackedRecord object is created for pAlloc if one does not exist and the new value is added to the UnpackedRecord object.
If pBt points to an empty file then convert that empty file into a new empty database by initializing the first page of the database.
If pBuf is not NULL, it means that memory space has already been allocated and that this routine should not allocate any new memory.

If pDbPage was a btree-page, then it may have child pages and/or cells that point to overflow pages.
If pDone is not NULL, then it is a record of pages that have already been played back.
If pExpr is a TK_COLUMN column reference, then this routine always returns true even if that particular column is not indexed, because the column might be added to an automatic index later.
If pExpr is a column in a virtual table, then let the virtual table implementation have an opportunity to overload the function.
If pExpr is a column, a reference to a column via an 'AS' alias, or a sub-select with a column as the return value, then the  affinity of that column is returned.
If pExpr is a constant, then this routine might generate this code to fill the register in the initialization section of the VDBE program, in order to factor it out of the evaluation loop.
If pExpr is an ASC iterator, this function returns a value with the same sign as:  (iLhs - iRhs)  Otherwise, if this is a DESC iterator, the opposite is returned:  (iRhs - iLhs)
If pExpr is part of a NEAR expression, then it also allocates and populates the same array for all other phrases that are part of the NEAR expression.

If pFile is currently larger than iSize bytes, then truncate it to exactly iSize bytes.
If pFile is not larger than iSize bytes, then this function is a no-op.
If pFree is not NULL, it points to the pSpace buffer used  by a previous call to balance_nonroot().
If pFrom contained any cells with overflow page pointers, then the corresponding pointer map entries are also updated so that the parent page is page pTo.
If pFrom contains ephemeral data, a copy is made.
If pIdx is NULL, then the parent key is the INTEGER PRIMARY KEY column of the parent table (table pTab).
If pIdx is not a partial index, *piPartIdxLabel will be set to zero which is an empty label that is ignored by sqlite3ResolvePartIdxLabel().
If pLast is NULL at this point, then the last rowid for this doclist lies on the page currently indicated by the iterator.
If pList is NULL, then the most recently added column of the table is the primary key.
If pList is initially NULL, then create a new expression list.
If pMem is a floating-point then the value returned is the integer part.
If pMem is a string or blob, then we make an attempt to convert it into an integer and return that.
If pMem is already a double or an integer, return its value.
If pMem is an integer, then the value is exact.
If pMem is an object with a valid string representation, this routine ensures the internal encoding for the string representation is 'desiredEnc', one of SQLITE_UTF8, SQLITE_UTF16LE or SQLITE_UTF16BE.
If pMem is not a string object, or the encoding of the string representation is already stored using the requested encoding, then this routine is a no-op.

If pStmt is NULL, return the first prepared statement for the database connection.
If pTab is a WITHOUT ROWID table, then iCur must be the cursor of the PRIMARY KEY index.
If pTab is a WITHOUT ROWID table, then it is the PRIMARY KEY index for that table that is actually opened.
If pTab is a virtual table, call ViewGetColumnNames() to ensure it is initialized.
If pTab is a virtual table, then this routine is a no-op and the piDataCur and *piIdxCur values are left uninitialized.
If pTab is already in the array, this routine is a no-op.
If pTab is really a view, make sure it has been initialized.
If pTemplate cannot supplant any existing element of the list but needs to be added to the list, then return a pointer to the tail of the list.

If paBlob is non-NULL, then it is the responsibility of the caller to eventually free the returned buffer.
If paBlob is not NULL, then a buffer is allocated using sqlite3_malloc() and populated with the contents of the blob stored in the "block" column of the  identified table row is.
If padding is needed, then the final frame is repeated (with its commit mark) until the next sector boundary is crossed.
If page 1 was just written, update Pager.dbFileVers to match the value now stored in the database file.
If page iPage has already been  copied into the destination database, then the data written to the destination is now invalidated.

If such a pointer can be obtained, store it in *pp and return SQLITE_OK.
If such a query is out-of-date, we do not want to discard the database schema, as the user code implementing the v-table would have to be ready for the sqlite3_vtab structure itself to be invalidated whenever sqlite3_step() is called from within  a v-table method.
If such a row is not found,  decrement the counter.
If support is added for switching proxy locking mode off then it will need to fail if the journal mode is WAL mode.
If table pTab has no temporary triggers, or is itself stored in the  temporary database, NULL is returned.
If temporary directory is changed, then invalidateTempStorage.
If that allocation failed, we would have quit before reaching this point
If that changes, this place will need some rework.
If that doesn't work, make a new memory block and copy.
If that fails, try it as an SUS integer type if it begins with "d" or as an SUS string type if it begins with "s".
If that fails, try it as an SUS integer type.
If that fails, we try "convert.charset.*", then "convert.*" This means that we don't need to clog up the hashtable with a zillion charsets (for example) but still be able to provide them all as filters
If that guess turns  out to be wrong, fall back to loading the data of page  number ovfl to determine the next page number.
If that is being changed dlsym() should only be used when building this extension sharedto offer compatibility.
If that is not possible, then the backup cannot proceed.
If that is successful, call sqlite3_declare_vtab() to configure the r-tree table schema.
If that is the case and pB is not using TK_REGISTER but is otherwise equivalent, then still return 0.
If that is the case, then the OP_OpenEphemeral instruction will be changed to an OP_Noop once we figure out that the sorting index is not needed.
If that is the case, then the result must be aligned on an even byte boundary.
If that is the case, this routine might think there is a hot journal when in fact there is none.
If that new rowid is larger than the maximum rowid in the memId memory cell, then the memory cell is updated.
If that was the last leaf node, break out of the loop
If that's less than best-so-far, update best distance and color number.
If the  authorization callback returns SQLITE_IGNORE, behave as if any values read from the parent table are NULL.
If the  database page-size is so large that more than RTREE_MAXCELLS entries  would fit in a single node, use a smaller node-size.
If the  operation to finalize the journal file fails, then the code still tries to unlock the database file if not in exclusive mode.
If the  reset parameter is non-zero, the cache hit or miss count is zeroed before  returning.
If the "-g" option was given on the command line, we want to continue  * to search for additional matches in the subject string, in a similar   * way to the /g option in Perl.
If the "bDesc"  parameter is passed a non-zero value, iteration is in descending rowid  order.
If the "data" parameter to this function is NULL, then the element corresponding to "key" is removed from the hash table.
If the "i" parameter is out of range, then SQLITE_RANGE is returned.
If the "last page" field of the wal-index header snapshot is 0, then no data will be read from the wal under any circumstances.
If the "nearby" parameter is not 0, then an effort is made to  locate a page close to the page number "nearby".
If the "temp" database is requested, it may need to be opened by this  function.
If the "unordered" keyword is present, then the query planner assumes that the index is unordered and will not use the index for a range query.
If the 'autoVacuum' parameter is non-zero, then auto-vacuum mode is enabled.
If the 'x' expression is a column value, or the SELECT...
If the 3rd parameter is non-negative, then it must be the byte offset into the string where the NUL terminator would appear if the string where NUL terminated.
If the B-Tree was successfully opened, set the pager-cache size to the default value.
If the CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE statement is being entered for the first time (in other words if the virtual table is actually being created now instead of just being read out of sqlite_master) then do additional initialization work and store the statement text in the sqlite_master table.
If the DELETE has generated immediate foreign key constraint  violations, halt the VDBE and return an error at this point, before any modifications to the schema are made.
If the DISTINCT keyword was present on the SELECT statement and this row has been seen before, then do not make this row part of the result.
If the EP_Reduced and EP_TokenOnly flags are set when an Expr object is truncated.
If the EP_Reduced flag is set in the Expr.flags mask, then no space is allocated for the fields below this point.
If the EP_TokenOnly flag is set in the Expr.flags mask, then no space is allocated for the fields below this point.
If the EP_xIsSelect bit is set in the Expr.flags mask, then Expr.x.pSelect is valid.
If the EXCLUSIVE lock is already held or the attempt to obtain it is successful, or the connection is in WAL mode, SQLITE_OK is returned.
If the EXPRDUP_REDUCE flag is set, then the return value includes  space to duplicate all Expr nodes in the tree formed by Expr.pLeft  and Expr.pRight variables (but not for any structures pointed to or  descended from the Expr.x.pList or Expr.x.pSelect variables).
If the EXPRDUP_REDUCE flag is set, then the structure returned is a truncated version of the usual Expr structure that will be stored as part of the in-memory representation of the database schema.
If the Expr is of type OP_Column, and the table it is selecting from is a disk table or the "old.*" pseudo-table, then pTab points to the corresponding table definition.
If the ExprList is an ORDER BY or GROUP BY clause then the resulting KeyInfo structure is appropriate for initializing a virtual index to implement that clause.
If the ExprList is the result set of a SELECT then the KeyInfo structure is appropriate for initializing a virtual index to implement a DISTINCT test.
If the FTS table features more than one index (because there are one or more prefix indexes), it is guaranteed that all share the same cookie value.
If the FULLFSYNC failed, fall back to attempting an fsync().
If the Firebird people ever fix this, these lines should be removed, otherwise, events will have to fire twice before ibase_wait_event() returns.
If the Fts3SegFilter defines a specific term (or term prefix) to search  for, then advance each segment iterator until it points to a term of equal or greater value than the specified term.
If the FuncDef is not ephermal, then do nothing.
If the HAS_MOVED file-control is unimplemented, assume that the file has not been moved.
If the Hash table is full, resize it
If the INSERT statement included an IDLIST term, then make sure all elements of the IDLIST really are columns of the table and  remember the column indices.
If the IN_INDEX_NOOP_OK and IN_INDEX_MEMBERSHIP are both set and if the RHS of the IN operator is a list (not a subquery) then this routine might decide that creating an ephemeral b-tree for membership testing is too expensive and return IN_INDEX_NOOP.
If the IOCAP_SEQUENTIAL device flag is set this is not required.
If the LHS is NULL, then the result is either false or NULL depending on whether the RHS is empty or not, respectively.
If the LHS is contained within the RHS then fall through.
If the LHS is not contained in the RHS, then the answer is NULL if the RHS contains NULLs and the answer is FALSE if the RHS is NULL-free.
If the LSB is set, then the checksums for each frame within the WAL file are calculated by treating all data as an array of 32-bit  big-endian words.
If the MEM_Null flag is set, then the value is an SQL NULL value.
If the MEM_Str flag is set then Mem.z points at a string representation.
If the MEM_Term flag is also set, then the string is nul terminated.
If the NEAR expression does not  match the current row, 0 is returned.
If the NEAR expression does not match any rows, zero the doclist for  all phrases involved in the NEAR.
If the OPFLAG_CLEARCACHE bit is set on P5 and P1 is a pseudo-table cursor, then the cache of the cursor is reset prior to extracting the column.
If the OPFLAG_ISUPDATE flag is set, then this opcode is part of an UPDATE operation.
If the OPFLAG_LASTROWID flag of P5 is set, then rowid is stored for subsequent return by the sqlite3_last_insert_rowid() function (otherwise it is unmodified).
If the OPFLAG_LENGTHARG and OPFLAG_TYPEOFARG bits are set on P5 when the result is guaranteed to only be used as the argument of a length() or typeof() function, respectively.
If the OPFLAG_NCHANGE bit is clear, then the change counter is unchanged.
If the OPFLAG_NCHANGE flag of P2 is set, then the row change count is incremented (otherwise not).
If the OPFLAG_NCHANGE flag of P5 is set, then the row change count is incremented (otherwise not).
If the OPFLAG_PERMUTE bit is clear, then register are compared in sequential order.
If the OPFLAG_USESEEKRESULT flag of P5 is set and if the result of the last seek operation (OP_NotExists) was a success, then this operation will not attempt to find the appropriate row before doing the insert but will instead overwrite the row that the cursor is currently pointing to.
If the ORDER BY clause contains only columns in the current  virtual table then allocate space for the aOrderBy part of the sqlite3_index_info structure.
If the OS does not have posix_fallocate(), fake it.
If the OS lacks large file support, or if the OS is windows, these should be no-ops.
If the P1 cursor must be pointing to a valid row (not a NULL row) of a real table, not a pseudo-table.
If the P1 index entry is greater than or equal to the key value then jump to P2.
If the P1 index entry is greater than the key value then jump to P2.
If the P1 index entry is less than or equal to the key value then jump to P2.
If the P1 index entry is less than the key value then jump to P2.
If the P1 value is non-zero, then also set the MEM_Cleared flag so that NULL values will not compare equal even if SQLITE_NULLEQ is set on OP_Ne or OP_Eq.
If the P3 value cannot be converted into any kind of a number, then the seek is not possible, so jump to P2
If the P3 value could not be converted into an integer without loss of information, then special processing is required...
If the P3 value is non-zero, then the table referred to must be an intkey table (an SQL table, not an index).
If the P5 parameter is non-zero, the cursor will be left pointing at  either the next or the previous record in the table.
If the PAGER_GET_NOCONTENT flag is set, it means that we do not care about the content of the page at this time.
If the PGHDR_NEED_SYNC flag is set for any of the nPage pages  starting at pg1, then it needs to be set for all of them.
If the PRIMARY KEY expression is NULL, then use OP_NewRowid to generate a unique primary key value.
If the PRIMARY KEY is on a single column whose datatype is INTEGER, then we will try to use that column as the rowid.
If the Pager.noSync flag is set, then this function is a no-op.
If the QUERY_SCAN flag is set, all other flags must be clear.
If the QUERY_TEST_NOIDX flag was specified, then this must be a prefix-query.
If the RBU database contains no data_xxx tables, declare the RBU update finished.
If the RBU handle is closed before the entire *-wal file is checkpointed, the checkpoint progress is saved in the RBU database and the checkpoint can be resumed by another RBU client at some point in the future.
If the RBU update has been completely applied, mark the RBU database as fully applied.
If the REQUIRE_RESEEK flag is set on the cursor passed as the first argument, close and reopen all Fts5IndexIter iterators that the cursor  is using.
If the SELECT keyword is immediately followed by a C-style comment then extract the first few alphanumeric characters from within that comment to be the zSelName value.
If the SELECT passed as the second argument has an associated WITH  clause, pop it from the stack stored as part of the Parse object.
If the SET_FULLSYNC macro is not defined above, then make it a no-op
If the SF_Converted flags is set, then this Select object was was created by the convertCompoundSelectToSubquery() function.
If the SID constant exists, destroy it.
If the SPILLFLAG_NOSYNC bit is set, writing to the database from pagerStress() is permitted, but syncing the journal file is not.
If the SQL column is blank it means this is an index that was created to be the PRIMARY KEY or to fulfill a UNIQUE constraint for a CREATE TABLE.
If the SQL is a query, then for each row in the query result the xCallback() function is called.
If the SQL statement does not currently point to a valid row, or if the column index is out of range, the result is undefined.
If the SQLITE_AFF_MASK is 0x00, then numeric affinity is used.
If the SQLITE_CountRows flag is set in sqlite3.flags mask, then  DML statements invoke this opcode to return the number of rows  modified to the user.
If the SQLITE_DeferFKs flag is set, then this is not required, as the statement transaction will not be rolled back even if FK constraints are violated.
If the SQLITE_ENABLE IOTRACE exists then the global variable sqlite3IoTrace is a pointer to a printf-like routine used to print I/O tracing messages.
If the SQLITE_ENABLE_8_3_NAMES option is enabled, then the original filename is unavailable.
If the SQLITE_JUMPIFNULL  bit is clear then fall through if either operand is NULL.
If the SQLITE_JUMPIFNULL bit of P5 is set and either reg(P1) or reg(P3) is NULL then take the jump.
If the SQLITE_NULLEQ bit is set in P5, then NULL values are considered equal to one another, provided that they do not have their MEM_Cleared bit set.
If the SQLITE_PreferBuiltin flag is set, then search the built-in functions even if a prior app-defined function was found.
If the SQLITE_STOREP2 bit of P5 is set, then do not jump.
If the SQLITE_TESTCTRL_FAULT_INSTALL callback is registered to a  function that returns SQLITE_ERROR when passed the argument 200, that forces worker threads to run sequentially and deterministically  (via the sqlite3FaultSim() term of the conditional) for testing purposes.
If the SQLITE_TESTCTRL_FAULT_INSTALL callback is registered to a  function that returns SQLITE_ERROR when passed the argument 200, that forces worker threads to run sequentially and deterministically  for testing purposes.
If the SQLITE_TRACE_SIZE_LIMIT macro is defined to an integer, then then long strings and blobs are truncated to that many bytes.
If the STATIC_MEM mutex is not already held, obtain it now.
If the Select object is really just a simple VALUES() list with a single row (the common case) then keep that one row of values and discard the other (unused) parts of the pSelect object
If the TEMP database is open, close it and mark the database schema as needing reloading.
If the TRANSLATE_TRACE macro is defined, the value of each Mem is printed on stderr on the way into and out of sqlite3VdbeMemTranslate().
If the TS is lower than the first transition time, then we scan over all the transition times to find the first non-DST one, or the first one in case there are only DST entries.
If the UPTO is just for 1 instance, we can use QUERY instead.
If the VDBE has be run even partially, then transfer the error code and error message from the VDBE into the main database structure.
If the VDBE has made changes and is in autocommit mode, then commit those changes.
If the VFS xLock() or xUnlock() returns an error other than SQLITE_BUSY (i.e. one of the SQLITE_IOERR subtypes), it is not clear whether or not the operation was successful.
If the VM did not run to completion or if it encountered an error, then it might not have been halted properly.
If the Vdbe passed as the first argument opened a statement-transaction, close it now.
If the WAL contains no copies of page P that are valid and which are a commit frame or are followed by a commit frame, then page P is read from the database file.
If the WAL file is currently larger than nMax bytes in size, truncate it to exactly nMax bytes.
If the WAL file is not empty, return the number of bytes of content stored in each frame (i.e. the db page-size when the WAL was created).
If the WAL is large (multiple megabytes is typical) that scan can be slow, and read performance suffers.
If the WAL is not empty, return the size of the database.
If the WHERE clause is empty, the foreach loops must each scan their entire tables.
If the WHERE_GROUPBY flag is set in the mask passed to sqlite3WhereBegin(), the planner assumes that the specified pOrderBy list is actually a GROUP BY clause - and so any order that groups rows as required satisfies the request.
If the Walker does not have an xSelectCallback() then this routine is a no-op returning WRC_Continue.
If the Win32 native heap is not isolated and/or the sqlite3_memory_used() function does not return zero, SQLITE_BUSY will be returned and no changes will be made to the Win32 native heap.
If the YYNOERRORRECOVERY macro is defined, then do not attempt to do any kind of error recovery.
If the ZVAL is null then it should be bound as that
If the above search did not find a BtLock struct associating Btree p with table iTable, allocate one and link it into the list.
If the above was an under estimate, increment the cycle number until the correct one is found.
If the above was successful, each component iterators now points  to the first entry in its segment.
If the action is "NO ACTION" or "RESTRICT", then a NULL pointer is returned (these actions require no special handling by the triggers sub-system, code for them is created by fkScanChildren()).
If the address is -1, then return the most recently inserted opcode.
If the allocated Fts3MultiSegReader just seeks to a single entry in a segment b-tree (if the term is not a prefix or it is a prefix for which there exists prefix b-tree of the right length) then it may be traversed and merged incrementally.
If the allocation fails, call sqlite3_result_error_nomem() to notify the database handle that malloc() has failed and return NULL.
If the allocation fails, make the mallocFailed flag in the connection pointer.
If the allocation is too large to be handled by this allocation system, return 0.
If the allocation succeeded, populate the new object.
If the allocation succeeds, zero it and return SQLITE_OK.
If the amount of space used to store records in main memory exceeds the threshold, then the set of records currently in memory are sorted and written to a temporary file in "Packed Memory Array" (PMA) format.
If the application then re-attempts the "DROP TABLE" or "DROP INDEX" query, an infinite loop might be the result.
If the application uses the "rbu_delta()" feature described above, it must use sqlite3_create_function() or similar to register the rbu_delta() implementation with the target database handle.
If the argument has no default value and no typehint, it is possible to pass less arguments than the function expects
If the argument is NULL, the return value is the string "NULL".
If the argument is a codepoint corresponding to a lowercase letter in the ASCII range with a diacritic added, return the codepoint of the ASCII letter only.
If the argument is not NULL, it points to a Wal object that holds a read-lock.
If the argument is numeric, the return value is the same as the argument.
If the argument p points to a JournalFile structure, and the underlying file has not yet been created, create it now.
If the argument to sqlite3_mutex_held() is a NULL pointer then the routine should return 1.
If the array is sparse, then the gaps will be filled with NULL variants
If the assertion has a quantifier that allows zero repeats we must skip over the BRAZERO.
If the atomic-update optimization is being used, this sync will not  create the journal file or perform any real IO.
If the atomic-write optimization is enabled in this build, then isDirect is initialized to the value passed as the isDirectMode parameter to this function.
If the attempt fails and parameter xBusy is not NULL, then it is a busy-handler function.
If the attempt to grab the exclusive lock failed, release the  pending lock that may have been obtained instead.
If the attempt to reload content from the database is required and fails,  return an SQLite error code.
If the auth function returns SQLITE_DENY, then generate an error.
If the auth function returns SQLITE_IGNORE, change the TK_COLUMN  instruction into a TK_NULL.
If the auto-commit flag is set and this is the only active writer  VM, then we do either a commit or rollback of the current transaction.
If the auto-commit flag is set to true, then any locks that were held by connection db have now been released.
If the b-tree mutexes are not taken here, then another shared-cache connection might sneak in between the database rollback and schema reset, which can cause false corruption reports in some cases.
If the b-tree structure is empty, the cursor state is set to  CURSOR_INVALID.
If the bClear argument is non-zero, then the auxiliary data is cleared (set to NULL) before this function returns.
If the bCommit flag is true, also close any open blob handles.
If the bCommit parameter is non-zero, this function assumes that the  caller will keep calling incrVacuumStep() until it returns SQLITE_DONE  or an error.
If the bCreate argument is true, create and initialize the underlying tables   If successful, set *pp to point to the new object and return SQLITE_OK.
If the bIncrRowid parameter is 0, then any OP_Rowid instructions on cursor iTabCur are transformed into OP_Null.
If the bPreserve flag is set to true, then the cursor position must be preserved following this delete operation.
If the bPreserve flag is set to true, then the memory cell must already contain a valid string or blob value.
If the bTryForInt flag is true, then extra effort is made to give an integer representation.
If the balance proceeds far enough up the tree that we can be sure that any problem in the internal node has been corrected, so be it.
If the bit corresponding to this variable in Vdbe.expmask is set, then  binding a new value to this variable invalidates the current query plan.
If the blob handle is not open at this point, open it and seek  to the requested entry.
If the blob has already been allocated, it is returned as normal.
If the bracket is capturing, and referenced by an OP_RECURSE, or it is an atomic sub-pattern (assert, once, etc.) the non-greedy case cannot be converted to a possessive form.
If the bracket is followed by a quantifier with zero repeat, we have to back off.
If the branch contains OP_RECURSE, the result is -3 because there may be forward references that we can't check here.
If the btree is already in a write-transaction, or it is already in a read-transaction and a read-transaction is requested, this is a no-op.
If the btree is successfully opened, use it to obtain the database schema.
If the buffer currently allocated is too small for this entry, realloc the buffer to make it large enough.
If the buffer turned out to be too small then allocate another buffer dynamically and use it to format the number.
If the bundle is invalid, split it in two.
If the bundle is valid as is, perform the encoding and return 1.
If the c-client library adds other options and the value for this one conflicts, simply make PHP_EXPUNGE higher at the top of this file
If the cache contains a page with page-number pgno, remove it from its hash chain.
If the cache is being used for an in-memory database, this function is a no-op.
If the cache previously contains an entry associated with newKey, it must be discarded.
If the call succeeds,  assume that the file-system supports POSIX style locks.
If the call to sqlite3WhereBegin() above resulted in a scan that uses an index, and this is either the first OR-connected term processed or the index is the same as that used by all previous terms, set pCov to the candidate covering index.
If the call to xUnlock() fails at this point and the pager is left holding an EXCLUSIVE lock, this can confuse the call to xCheckReservedLock() call made later as part of hot-journal detection.
If the callback function returns any value other than SQLITE_OK, the query is abandoned and the xQueryPhrase function returns immediately.
If the callback function returns anything other than SQLITE_OK,  the iteration is abandoned and the error code returned immediately.
If the callback returns other than SQLITE_OK, it is not invoked again and the error code is returned to the caller.
If the caller happens to have a pointer to the MemPage object  corresponding to page iPage handy, it may pass it as the second value.
If the caller is an UPDATE or DELETE statement that is requesting to use a one-pass algorithm, determine if this is appropriate.
If the caller is successful, set the Pager.eLock variable to the new locking state.
If the cell content will fit on the page, then put it there.
If the cell deleted was not located on a leaf page, then the cursor is currently pointing to the largest entry in the sub-tree headed by the child-page of the cell that was just deleted from an internal node.
If the cell pCell, part of page pPage contains a pointer to an overflow page, insert an entry into the pointer-map for the overflow page.
If the character following a repeat is '+', possessive_quantifier is TRUE.
If the character is more than one byte long, we can set firstchar only if it is not to be matched caselessly.
If the checksum cannot be verified return non-zero.
If the checksum doesn't add up, then one or more of the disk sectors containing the master journal filename is corrupted.
If the child is position absolute (without top/left) or relative, we put it at the current accumulated offset.
If the child node is now at EOF, so is the parent AND node.
If the child table is the same as the parent table, then add terms to the WHERE clause that prevent this entry from being scanned.
If the class contains characters outside the 0-255 range, a different opcode is compiled.
If the client is reading  or writing an index and the schema is not loaded, then it is too difficult to actually check to see if the correct locks are held.
If the close fails, we pause for 100 milliseconds and try again.
If the close-quote is found, the value returned is the byte offset of the character immediately following it.
If the code incorrectly assumes that it is the POSIX version that is available, the error message will often be an empty string.
If the codepoint is an upper case character that has a lower case equivalent, return the codepoint corresponding to the lower case version.
If the collation factory does not supply such a sequence, and the sequence is available in another text encoding, then that is returned instead.
If the column affinity is REAL but the number is an integer, then it might be stored in the table as an integer (using a compact representation) then converted to REAL by an OP_RealAffinity opcode.
If the column contains fewer than P2 fields, then extract a NULL.
If the column has REAL affinity, it may currently be stored as an integer.
If the column is modified, the value is 0 or greater.
If the column number is greater than the number of bits in the bitmask then set the high-order bit of the bitmask.
If the column value is an ephemeral string, go ahead and persist that string in case the cursor moves before the column value is used.
If the command failed, output an explanation.
If the commit could not complete because of lock contention, return SQLITE_BUSY.
If the compilation succeeded, we call PCRE again, in order to do a     * pattern match against the subject string.
If the compound query operator is UNION then no duplicate rows are ever inserted into the Queue table.
If the conch file does not exist, or its contents do not match the host ID and/or proxy path, then the lock is escalated to an exclusive lock and the conch file contents is updated with the host ID and proxy path and the lock is downgraded to a shared lock again.
If the conch is held by another process (with a shared lock), the exclusive lock will fail and SQLITE_BUSY is returned.
If the condition asserted by this function were not true, and the dirty page were to be discarded from the cache via the pagerStress() routine, pagerStress() would not write the current page content to the database file.
If the condition is false, skipping the first branch takes us past the end of the item if there is only one branch, but that's exactly what we want.
If the conditions above are not met, this function returns SQLITE_OK and sets (*ppVal) to NULL.
If the connection is in WAL mode, this call is a no-op.
If the connection is open in WAL-mode, a WAL write transaction is open (i.e. sqlite3WalBeginWriteTransaction() has been successfully called).
If the connection is open in rollback-mode, a RESERVED or greater  lock is held on the database file.
If the constraint is satisfied, leave *peWithin unchanged.
If the content of register P1 is initially nonzero, then subtract P3 from the value in register P1 and jump to P2.
If the contents of this page were just restored from the main  journal file, then its content must be as they were when the  transaction was first opened.
If the conversion to a gmp number fails, the macros return false.
If the coroutine that is launched by this instruction ends with Yield or Return then continue to the next instruction.
If the cost of computing an automatic index is not paid back within the first 28 rows, then do not use the automatic index.
If the createFlag argument is true, then a new (blank) FuncDef structure is created and liked into the "db" structure if a no matching function previously existed.
If the createFlag is 0, then NULL is always returned if the page is not already in the cache.
If the createFlag parameter is true and the search did not reveal an exact match for the name, number of arguments and encoding, then add a new entry to the hash table and return it.
If the current block is not empty, and if adding this term/doclist to the current block would make it larger than Fts3Table.nNodeSize bytes, write this block out to the database.
If the current cursor entry uses one or more overflow pages and the eOp argument is not 2, this function may allocate space for and lazily  populates the overflow page-list cache array (BtCursor.aOverflow).
If the current database is not encrypted, this routine will encrypt it.
If the current delete will cause a b-tree rebalance, then this is done by saving the cursor key and leaving the cursor in CURSOR_REQUIRESEEK state before  returning.
If the current leaf page is full, flush it to disk.
If the current node of layer iLayer contains zero keys, or if adding the key to it will not cause it to grow to larger than nNodeSize  bytes in size, write the key here.
If the current number of pages in the file is greater than the configured maximum pager number, increase the allowed limit so that the file can be read.
If the current operation is an UPDATE, then the pChanges parameter is passed a pointer to the list of columns being modified.
If the current pIdx index is generating its key into the same sequence of registers and if pPrior and pIdx share a column in common, then the register corresponding to that column already holds the correct value and the loading of that register is skipped.
If the current row is a match, the position list associated with each phrase in the NEAR expression is edited in place to contain only those phrase instances sufficiently close to their peers to satisfy all NEAR constraints.
If the current row is already present in the index, do not write it to the output.
If the current size of the database file is 0 but a journal file exists, that is probably an old journal left over from a prior database with the same name.
If the current time is requested more than once within the same run of a single prepared statement, the exact same time is returned for each invocation regardless of the amount of time that elapses between invocations.
If the cursor already points to the last entry, this is a no-op.
If the cursor cache is stale, bring it up-to-date
If the cursor does not yet have a statement handle, obtain one now.
If the cursor is already pointing to the correct row and that row has not been deleted out from under the cursor, then this routine is a no-op.
If the cursor is already positioned at the point we are trying to move to, then just return without doing any work
If the cursor is changed, the value of register P2 will then change.
If the cursor is currently on the last row and we are appending a new row onto the end, set the "loc" to avoid an unnecessary btreeMoveto() call
If the cursor is left pointing to the last entry in the table, and the next row inserted has an integer key larger than the largest existing key, it is possible to insert the row without seeking the cursor.
If the cursor is not at EOF, read the next character
If the cursor is not currently open or is open on a different index, then fall through into OP_OpenRead to force a reopen
If the cursor is not pointing to a valid entry, *pSize is set to 0.
If the cursor requires seeking (bSeekRequired flag is set), seek it.
If the cursor was opened expecting an intkey table, the caller should be inserting integer keys with a blob of associated data.
If the data is coming from a SELECT statement, then generate a co-routine that produces a single row of the SELECT on each invocation.
If the data_xxx tables in the RBU source database are virtual  tables, the application may need to call sqlite3_create_module() on the rbu update db handle to any required virtual table implementations.
If the database contains foreign key violations when the  transaction is opened, this may cause the mechanism to malfunction.
If the database contents have changes since the previous read transaction, then *pChanged is set to 1 before returning.
If the database file is corrupt, it is possible for the value of idx  to be invalid here.
If the database file was of zero-length, then the DB_Empty flag is also set.
If the database has changed, flush the cache.
If the database image is smaller than the requested page or if a  non-zero value is passed as the noContent parameter and the  requested page is not already stored in the cache, then no  actual disk read occurs.
If the database is a WAL database, then the WAL connection is open.
If the database is already nBytes or larger, this routine is a no-op.
If the database is already opened in the same database connection and we are in shared cache mode, then the open will fail with an SQLITE_CONSTRAINT error.
If the database is empty or if no *-wal file exists and if no error occurs, make sure Pager.journalMode is not set to PAGER_JOURNALMODE_WAL.
If the database is not empty and the *-wal file exists, open the pager in WAL mode.
If the database is not initialized, it is initialized now.
If the database is zero pages in size, that means that either (1) the journal is a remnant from a prior database with the same name where the database file but not the journal was deleted, or (2) the initial transaction that populates a new database is being rolled back.
If the database may be auto-vacuum capable (if SQLITE_OMIT_AUTOVACUUM is not defined), then it is important to call OP_Destroy on the table and index root-pages in order, starting with the numerically  largest root-page number.
If the database may grow as a result of this checkpoint, hint about the eventual size of the db file to the VFS layer.
If the database page size is not a power of two, or is greater than SQLITE_MAX_PAGE_SIZE, conclude that the WAL file contains no valid  data.
If the database schema is shared, then there is one instance of this structure for each database connection (sqlite3*) that uses the shared schema.
If the database supports auto-vacuum, and the second or subsequent overflow page is being allocated, add an entry to the pointer-map for that page now.
If the database supports auto-vacuum, make sure no tables contain references to pointer-map pages.
If the database supports auto-vacuum, write an entry in the pointer-map to indicate that the page is free.
If the database was not actually modified during this transaction, the pager is running in exclusive-mode and is using persistent journals, then this function is a no-op.
If the database was unlocked prior to this instruction then a read lock is acquired as part of this instruction.
If the date is already on the appropriate weekday, this is a no-op.
If the db handle must hold the connection handle mutex here.
If the db-size header field is incorrect (as it may be if an old client has been writing the database file), update it now.
If the decimal precision guaranteed by FP arithmetic is higher than the requested places BUT is small enough to make sure a non-zero value is returned, pre-round the result to the precision
If the default page cache implementation is overridden, then neither of these two features are available.
If the default value for the new column was specified with a  literal NULL, then set pDflt to 0.
If the default value is NULL, the action is the same as ABORT.
If the default value of the new column is NULL, then set the file format to 2.
If the default value of the new column is not NULL, the file format becomes 3.
If the depth as specified on the root node is greater than RTREE_MAX_DEPTH, the r-tree structure must be corrupt.
If the descriptor being freed is the end-most one allocated, then the descriptor_count is reduced so a future descriptor can reuse the hash table index.
If the destination is DistFifo, then cursor (iParm+1) is open on an ephemeral index.
If the destination is DistQueue, then cursor (iParm+1) is open on a second ephemeral index that holds all values every previously added to the queue.
If the destination is an EXISTS(...) expression, the actual values returned by the SELECT are not required.
If the device does not support the SEQUENTIAL property, then  journal file is synced.
If the dirSync argument is true, fsync() the directory after deleting the file.
If the docids in the  input doclists are sorted in ascending order, parameter bDescDoclist should be false.
If the docids in the input doclists are sorted in ascending order, parameter bDescDoclist should be false.
If the double is out of range of a 64-bit signed integer then return the closest available 64-bit signed integer.
If the eMode parameter is BTALLOC_EXACT and the nearby page exists anywhere on the free-list, then it is guaranteed to be returned.
If the either the page-size or sector-size in the journal-header is  invalid, then the process that wrote the journal-header must have  crashed before the header was synced.
If the end of the  doclist-index page is reached, return non-zero.
If the end of the buffer is reached before a token is found, set *ppExpr to zero.
If the end of the file has been reached, the routine has a choice of ERREXIT() or inserting fake data into the buffer.
If the ending delimiter is not found, display a warning.
If the ending matches this...
If the entry deleted was located on a leaf page, then the cursor still points to that page.
If the entry fits our requirements
If the entry specified by zName and nName is not found and parameter 'create' is true, then create a new entry.
If the entry specified is not found and 'create' is true, then create a new entry.
If the epxression is anything other than TK_STRING, the expression is unchanged.
If the error  occurred while writing to the journal, sub-journal or database file as part of an effort to free up cache space (see function pagerStress() in pager.c), the rollback is required to restore  the pager to a consistent state.
If the error condition  persists, the pager enters the ERROR state via condition (1) above.
If the error is an unrecognized modifier, no error is written to pCtx.
If the error is in a system call (i.e. localtime()), then an error message is written to context pCtx.
If the error message is too large for the supplied buffer, it should be truncated.
If the error occurs during the first call to sqlite3BtreeCommitPhaseOne(), then there is a chance that the master journal file will be orphaned.
If the estimated length exceeds the really used length, mark the extra allocated memory as unaddressable, so that any out-of-bound reads can be detected.
If the event is method entry/exit, check that in the current mode VTune is allowed to receive it
If the event is of the form  UPDATE ON (a,b,c)  Then the "b" IdList records the list "a,b,c".
If the exFlag argument is false, then acquire at least a RESERVED lock on the database file.
If the exFlag parameter is true, then immediately upgrade this to an EXCLUSIVE lock.
If the exception was thrown during a function call there might be arguments pushed to the stack that have to be dtor'ed.
If the exec call supplied NULL for tables, use the inbuilt ones.
If the expression can be converted directly into a value, then the value is allocated and a pointer written to *ppVal.
If the expression cannot be converted to a value, then *ppVal is set to NULL.
If the expression evaluates to NULL (neither true nor false) then jump if jumpIfNull is SQLITE_JUMPIFNULL or fall through if jumpIfNull is 0.
If the expression evaluates to NULL (neither true nor false), then take the jump if the jumpIfNull flag is SQLITE_JUMPIFNULL.
If the expression has got more back references than the offsets supplied can hold, we get a temporary chunk of working store to use during the matching.
If the expression is "x NEAR y", it is  advanced to point to the next row that matches "x AND y".
If the expression is a subquery then Expr.iColumn holds an integer register number containing the result of the subquery.
If the expression is a variable (TK_VARIABLE), then Expr.token contains the  variable name.
If the expression is always either TRUE or FALSE (respectively), then return 1.
If the expression is an SQL literal (TK_INTEGER, TK_FLOAT, TK_BLOB,  or TK_STRING), then Expr.token contains the text of the SQL literal.
If the expression is constant, then this routine might choose to code the expression at initialization time.
If the expression is not an integer or if it is too big to fit in a signed 32-bit integer, return 0 and leave *pValue unchanged.
If the expression is not constant then we will need to disable the test that was generated above that makes sure this code only executes once.
If the expression is used as a result in an aggregate SELECT, then the value is also stored in the Expr.iAgg column in the aggregate so that it can be accessed after all aggregates are computed.
If the expression list pEList contains more than iLimit elements, leave an error message in pParse.
If the expression might be NULL or if the expression is too complex to tell return TRUE.
If the expression p codes a constant integer that is small enough to fit in a 32-bit integer, return 1 and put the value of the integer in *pValue.
If the extension function is invoked  more than once for a single FTS query, then all invocations share a  single auxiliary data context.
If the field type is etGENERIC, then convert to either etEXP or etFLOAT, as appropriate.
If the file cannot be loaded directly, attempts are made to load with various operating-system specific extensions added.
If the file creation mode "m" is 0 then set it to the default for SQLite.
If the file does not already exist, this will fail.
If the file exists, it fails.
If the file format and encoding in the database have not been set,  set them now.
If the file has the SQLITE_IOCAP_POWERSAFE_OVERWRITE property, then set the effective sector size to its minimum value (512).
If the file is a JournalFile, and the underlying file on disk has not yet been opened, return 0.
If the file is a temp-file has not yet been opened, open it now.
If the file is not a well-formed database file, then SQLITE_CORRUPT is returned.
If the file is unlocked and the file-system does not exhibit the UNDELETABLE_WHEN_OPEN property, the journal file is closed (if it is open).
If the file on disk is currently larger than nPage pages, then use the VFS xTruncate() method to truncate it.
If the file on disk is smaller than the database image, use  pager_truncate to grow the file here.
If the file opened as the journal file is not a well-formed journal file then all pages up to the first corrupted page are rolled back (or no pages if the journal header is corrupted).
If the file was just truncated to a size smaller than the currently mapped region, reduce the effective mapping size as well.
If the file was opened successfully, read the schema for the new database.
If the file was successfully opened for read/write access, choose a default page size in case we have to create the database file.
If the file was truncated to a size smaller than the currently mapped region, reduce the effective mapping size as well.
If the filename starts with "." or "/", the path is ignored.
If the final parameter - noSync - is true, then the database file itself is not synced.
If the first argument was constant then bit 0 of P1 is set.
If the first attempt failed, it might have been due to a race with a writer.
If the first digit is 8 or 9, Perl used to generate a binary zero byte and then treat the digit as a following literal.
If the first field is an integer, the maximum legal header size is (12*5 + 1 + 1) bytes.
If the first integer value is followed by a ',',  read the second integer value.
If the first page of the wal-index has been mapped, try to read the wal-index header immediately, without holding any lock.
If the first part of a qualified name is an alias, substitute it.
If the first temporary PMA file has not been opened, open it now.
If the flex share of remaining space doesn't meet min/max bounds, remove this child from flex calculations.
If the following function pointer is not NULL and if SQLITE_ENABLE_IOTRACE is enabled, then messages describing I/O active are written using this function.
If the following global variable points to a string which is the name of a directory, then that directory will be used to store all database files specified with a relative pathname.
If the following global variable points to a string which is the name of a directory, then that directory will be used to store temporary files.
If the former, then *ppFree is set to a pointer that should be eventually freed by the caller using sqlite3DbFree().
If the former, then all row-records are guaranteed to include a value for the column and the P4 value is not required.
If the fourth argument, isCommit, is non-zero, then this page is being moved as part of a database reorganization just before the transaction  is being committed.
If the fourth parameter is 0, then the database connection passed as the second argument has just been opened.
If the fourth parameter is 1, then the SQL statement that the third parameter points to has just been executed.
If the fourth parameter to sqlite3_bind_blob() is negative, then the behavior is undefined.
If the free-list is currently empty, or if the first trunk page in the free-list is full, then this page will become a new free-list trunk page.
If the free-list must be searched for 'nearby'
If the fts5YYNOERRORRECOVERY macro is defined, then do not attempt to do any kind of error recovery.
If the function already exists as a regular global function, then this routine is a no-op.
If the function does not exist, then create a new one that always throws a run-time error.
If the function is an aggregate function, then the NC_HasAgg flag is set and the opcode is changed from TK_FUNCTION to TK_AGG_FUNCTION.
If the function is not a LIKE-style function then return FALSE.
If the function makes the distinction between uppercase and lowercase (as does GLOB) then *pIsNocase is set to false.
If the function returned an error, throw an exception
If the garbage data came from an obsolete journal file, the checksums might be correct.
If the generator has been closed, it can only hold on to three values: The value, key and retval.
If the generator is already closed throw the exception in the current context
If the given Mem* has a zero-filled tail, turn it into an ordinary blob stored in dynamically allocated space.
If the given buffer is not large enough to hold the data, the return value is the buffer size,  in characters, required to hold the string and its terminating null character.
If the given bugger is not large enough to hold the data, the return value is the buffer size,  in characters, required to hold the string and its terminating null character.
If the group is preceded by OP_BRAZERO, convert this to OP_BRAPOSZERO.
If the handle had any kind of transaction open, decrement the  transaction count of the shared btree.
If the handle has a write-transaction open, commit the shared-btrees  transaction and set the shared state to TRANS_READ.
If the header is read successfully and the checksum verified, return zero.
If the header is read successfully, *pNRec is set to the number of page records following this header and *pDbSize is set to the size of the database before the transaction began, in pages.
If the header is read successfully, check the version number to make sure the wal-index was not constructed with some future format that this version of SQLite cannot understand.
If the height is greater than the maximum allowed expression depth, leave an error in pParse.
If the hint blob in *pHint does not contain at least two valid varints, return SQLITE_CORRUPT_VTAB.
If the iCol argument to this function was negative, this means all columns of the FTS3 table.
If the iStart argument had been 1 instead of 2, then the result would have been:  A, nil, nil, nil, B.
If the idx and tbl columns are the same, then the sample is of the INTEGER PRIMARY KEY.
If the im-pointer points to a brand new image, the cache gives out bogus colorindexes.
If the implementation does not provide working versions of these routines, it should at least provide stubs that always return true so that one does not get spurious assertion failures.
If the incremental vacuum is finished after this function has run, SQLITE_DONE is returned.
If the index is 0xffff, then there are no nodes for the property.
If the index is created successfully, return a pointer to the new Index structure.
If the index is unique, then the last integer will be 1.
If the index name was unqualified, check if the table is a temp table.
If the index or temporary table used by the GROUP BY sort will naturally deliver rows in the order required by the ORDER BY clause, cancel the ephemeral table open coded earlier.
If the index uses a collation sequence that is different from the default collation sequence for the column, this index is unusable.
If the initial value of register P1 is less than 1, then the value is unchanged and control passes through to the next instruction.
If the inner loop was generated using a non-null pOrderBy argument, then the results were placed in a sorter.
If the input FuncDef structure is ephemeral, then free it.
If the input day is in the first two months, we want the molad at the start of the year.
If the input day is in the fourth to last months, we want the molad at the end of the year.
If the input day is in the third month, it doesn't matter which molad is returned, because both will be required.
If the input does not begin with a quote character, then this routine is a no-op.
If the input is not a keyword, TK_ID is returned.
If the input is of the form Z (not Y.Z or X.Y.Z) then the name Z might refer to an result-set alias.
If the input list contains too few elements, then construct an incomplete tree and leave *ppList set to NULL.
If the input word is too long (more than 20 bytes if it contains no digits or more than 6 bytes if it contains digits) then word is truncated to 20 or 6 bytes by taking 10 or 3 bytes from the beginning and end.
If the insert is successful, return SQLITE_OK.
If the integer is -1, then it is overwritten with the current WAL persistence setting.
If the integer is -1, then it is overwritten with the current zero-damage mode setting.
If the integer is an alpha-numeric  unicode code point, 1 is returned.
If the interior node term is larger than the specified term, then the tree headed by iChild may contain the specified term.
If the invoked function returns non-zero, then the commit becomes a rollback.
If the isCopyTerm parameter is true, then the buffer pointed to by zTerm is transient, so take a copy of the term data.
If the isDirectMode flag is zero, then this is done by calling  sqlite3PagerWrite() on page 1, then modifying the contents of the page data.
If the isPoslist argument is true, then it is assumed that the doclist contains a position-list following each docid.
If the isPrefixIter parameter is zero, then the returned SegReader iterates through each term in the pending-terms table.
If the iterator is not at a real match, skip forward until it is.
If the iterator passed as the second argument does not currently point to a table (not index) with an external primary key, this function is a no-op.
If the iterator points to EOF when this function is called the results are undefined.
If the iterator reaches EOF, set *pbEof to true before returning.
If the iterator skips through rowids in the default ascending order, this means the maximum rowid.
If the journal does not exist, it usually means that some  other connection managed to get in and roll it back before  this connection obtained the exclusive lock above.
If the journal file is already open (as it may be in exclusive mode), then this function just writes a journal header to the start of the already open file.
If the journal file is open, then it is "finalized".
If the journal file is too small for there to be a header stored at this point, return SQLITE_DONE.
If the journal has been truncated, simply stop reading and processing the journal.
If the journal header file appears to be corrupted, SQLITE_DONE is returned and *pNRec and *PDbSize are undefined.
If the journal is merely persistent, no reset is needed.
If the journal really is hot, reset the pager cache prior rolling back any content.
If the key and/or data spills onto overflow pages, then accessPayload() must be used to reassemble the key/data and copy it into a preallocated buffer.
If the key is not an INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, then create a unique index for the key.
If the keys are equal (only possible with two EOF values), it doesn't matter which index is stored.
If the last connection that wrote to this database was operating in persistent-journal mode, then the journal file may at this point actually be larger than Pager.journalOff bytes.
If the last opcode is "op" and it is not a jump destination, then remove it.
If the latter, then the row-records in the table btree on disk may not contain a value for the column and the default value, taken from the P4 parameter of the OP_Column instruction, is returned instead.
If the leaf in question has already been trimmed from the segment,  ignore this b-tree entry.
If the least significant bit in flags is clear, then the rule applies to all nRange codepoints (i.e. all nRange codepoints are upper case and need to be folded).
If the left hand expression has a collating sequence type, then it is used.
If the left hand side of the regexp operator is NULL,  then the result is also NULL.
If the left side is "database.id" then pId1 is the database name and pId2 is the id.
If the left side is just "id" then pId1 is the id and pId2 is any empty string.
If the length is negative, it means the reference is unset in non-Java-compatible mode.
If the length of the reference is zero, just continue with the main loop.
If the library is compiled to omit the full-scale date and time handling (to get a smaller binary), the following minimal version of the functions current_time(), current_date() and current_timestamp() are included instead.
If the library is compiled with the shared-cache feature disabled, then there is only ever one user of each BtShared structure and so this locking is not necessary.
If the list is in order (which it should be), ranges of characters are detected and handled appropriately.
If the load failed, it must not be a PNG file.
If the locale is grandfathered, stop, no variants
If the lock cannot be obtained, SQLITE_BUSY is returned and no data is written to the database file.
If the lock failed (busy): 1st try: get the mod time of the conch, wait 0.5s and try again.
If the lock is obtained successfully, set the Pager.state  variable to locktype before returning.
If the locking level of the file descriptor is already at or below the requested locking level, this routine is a no-op.
If the log file is not already open, but does exist in the file-system, it may need to be checkpointed before the connection can switch to rollback mode.
If the log file is successfully opened, SQLITE_OK is returned and  ppWal is set to point to a new WAL handle.
If the log is not already open, open it now.
If the log message is longer than a few hundred characters, it will be truncated to the length of the buffer.
If the look-ahead token is YYNOCODE, then check to see if the action is independent of the look-ahead.
If the look-ahead token is fts5YYNOCODE, then check to see if the action is independent of the look-ahead.
If the lower four bits equal SQLITE_SYNC_FULL, that means to use Mac OS X style fullsync instead of fsync().
If the lower four bits of the flag equal SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL, that means to use normal fsync() semantics.
If the magic name ":memory:" will create an in-memory database, then leave the autoVacuum mode at 0 (do not auto-vacuum), even if SQLITE_DEFAULT_AUTOVACUUM is true.
If the main database exists, the new sqlite.enc value will be overwritten when the schema is next loaded.
If the main database file is not open, or the pager is not in either DBMOD or OPEN state, this function is a no-op.
If the main database has not been initialized and/or created when ATTACH is executed, this is done before the ATTACH operation.
If the mapping is not attempted  (because the file is too large or the VFS layer is configured not to use mmap), return SQLITE_OK and set *pp to NULL.
If the master journal name in the journal is longer than nMaster bytes (including a nul-terminator), then this is handled as if no master journal name were present in the journal.
If the match fails at the newline, later code breaks this loop.
If the match should not be empty
If the maximum is 1 or unlimited, we just have to stick in the BRAZERO and do no more at this point.
If the maximum is greater than 1 and limited, we have to replicate in a nested fashion, sticking OP_BRAZERO before each set of brackets.
If the maximum is limited, it replicates the group in a nested fashion, remembering the bracket starts on a stack.
If the maximum is not zero or one, set it to 1.
If the maximum is unlimited, insert an OP_STAR.
If the maximum is unlimited, set a repeater in the final copy.
If the maximum is unlimited, we use OP_PLUS.
If the memory cell contains a value that must be freed by invoking the external callback in Mem.xDel, then this routine will free that value.
If the minimum equals the maximum, we are done.
If the minimum is greater than zero, replicate the group as many times as necessary, and adjust the maximum to the number of subsequent copies that we need.
If the minimum is zero, mark it as possessive, then unset the possessive flag when the minimum is 0 or 1.
If the minimum is zero, we can continue at the same level without recursion.
If the mmap() above failed, assume that all subsequent mmap() calls will probably fail too.
If the module has been registered and includes a Create method,  invoke it now.
If the module has not been registered, return an  error.
If the molad occurs on or after noon, Tishri 1 must be delayed.
If the month is 1 or 2, the calculation is simple addition to the first of the year.
If the month is 4 to 7, it is considered whether it is a leap year and then simple subtraction from the beginning of the following year is used.
If the month is 8 (Nisan) or greater, the calculation is simple subtraction from beginning of the following year.
If the most recent API call was successful, then the return value from sqlite3_errcode() is undefined.
If the nBytes parameter is 0 and the blob of memory has not yet been allocated, a null pointer is returned.
If the nRec value is 0xffffffff it means that nRec should be computed from the file size.
If the name cannot be resolved unambiguously, leave an error message in pParse and return WRC_Abort.
If the name is duplicated, add one to the opcode to change CREF/RREF into DNCREF/DNRREF and insert appropriate data values.
If the name is not found, leave the value of recno as 0 for a forward reference.
If the name is not unique, append an integer to the name so that it becomes unique.
If the new Btree uses a sharable pBtShared, then link the new Btree into the list of all sharable Btrees for the same connection.
If the new rowid is not equal to the old, set output parameter *pbSkip to 1 before returning.
If the next call to a user function or aggregate calls sqlite3GetFuncCollSeq(), this collation sequence will be returned.
If the next character is '+', we have a possessive quantifier.
If the next character is a digit, this is a floating point number that begins with ".".
If the next entry is going to be too big for the code size, then increase it, if possible.
If the next month is invalid, then we need to try the first month of the next year, bearing in mind that the next year after 1 BCE is actually 1 AD and not 0.
If the next thing in the journal file happens to be a journal-header (written as part of the previous connection's transaction), and a crash or power-failure  occurs after nRec is updated but before this connection writes  anything else to the journal file (or commits/rolls back its  transaction), then SQLite may become confused when doing the  hot-journal rollback following recovery.
If the node being flushed is currently the root node, also push its first rowid upwards.
If the node is dirty and the reference count drops to zero, the node data is written to the database.
If the node is dirty, write it out to the database.
If the node is not the tree root and now has less than the minimum number of cells, remove it from the tree.
If the node is the root node (node 1), then the first 2 bytes of the node contain the tree depth as a big-endian integer.
If the number is less than 8 (used to be 10), or if there are that many previous extracting left brackets, then it is a back reference.
If the number of captured subpatterns on this run is less than the total possible number, pad the result arrays with empty strings.
If the number of elements in x.pList is even, then Y is omitted and the "otherwise" result is NULL.
If the number of pages in the database is not available from the WAL sub-system, determine the page counte based on the size of the database file.
If the number of references to the page drop to zero, then the page is added to the LRU list.
If the number of savepoints is already equal to nSavepoint, then this function is a no-op.
If the number of virtual machine operations exceeds 2147483647 then the value returned by this statement status code is undefined.
If the numeric type of argument pVal is "integer", then return it converted to a 64-bit signed integer.
If the object has not already been allocated, allocate and populate it now.
If the object is not sharable, then no mutex is ever required and this routine is a no-op.
If the octal value is greater than 377, the least significant 8 bits are taken.
If the offset vector is bigger, malloc is used.
If the on-conflict mode is REPLACE, this means that the existing row should be deleted from the database before inserting the new row.
If the opcode is TK_TRIGGER, then the expression is a reference to a column in the new.* or old.* pseudo-tables available to trigger programs.
If the opcode is not a repeated character type, it returns with the original value.
If the open statement-transaction is not closed here, then the user may step another VM that opens its own statement transaction.
If the operating system does not support sleep requests with millisecond time resolution, then the time will be rounded up to the nearest second.
If the operating system support deletion of open files, then close the journal file when dropping the database lock.
If the operation is a DELETE, then parameter aChange is passed a NULL value.
If the operation is a delete, it must be called (at least) once for each unique token in the document with an iCol value less than zero.
If the operation is an UPDATE, then parameter pChanges is passed the list of columns being modified.
If the operator is UNION ALL, then duplicates are allowed.
If the optimization cannot be used, 0 is returned.
If the optimization is compiled in but is not applicable to this transaction, call sqlite3JournalCreate() to make sure the journal file has actually been created, then call pager_incr_changecounter() to update the change-counter in indirect mode.
If the optimization was not enabled at compile time, then the pager_incr_changecounter() function is called to update the change counter in 'indirect-mode'.
If the optional parameter is set to true, return the phar:// URL to the currently running phar
If the options are changed during the branch, the pointer is used to change the external options bits.
If the options ended with ')' this is not the start of a nested group with option changes, so the options change at this level.
If the options ended with ':' we are heading into a nested group with possible change of options.
If the order-by term is an identifier that corresponds to the AS-name of a result-set expression, then the term resolves to a copy of the result-set expression.
If the order-by term is an integer I between 1 and N (where N is the number of columns in the result set of the SELECT) then the expression in the resolution is a copy of the I-th result-set expression.
If the original WHERE clause is z of the form:  (x1 OR x2 OR ...) AND y Then for every term xN, evaluate as the subexpression: xN AND z That way, terms in y that are factored into the disjunction will be picked up by the recursive calls to sqlite3WhereBegin() below.
If the original bucket has a refcount of 1 and owns its buffer, then it is returned unchanged.
If the original database file (pDbFd) is using the "unix-excl" VFS that means that an exclusive lock is held on the database file and that no other processes are able to read or write the database.
If the original is changed while the copy is still in use, the string or blob might be changed out from under the copy.
If the output * vector wasn't big enough, say so.
If the output is destined for a temporary table, open that table.
If the overflow page-list cache has been allocated and the entry for the first required overflow page is valid, skip directly to it.
If the p2 instruction of this OP_Halt instruction is set to OE_Ignore, then the sub-program is throwing an IGNORE exception.
If the p5 flag is clear, then recursive invocation of triggers is  disabled for backwards compatibility (p5 is set if this sub-program is really a trigger, not a foreign key action, and the flag set and cleared by the "PRAGMA recursive_triggers" command is clear).
If the pBase expression originated in the ON or USING clause of a join, then transfer the appropriate markings over to derived.
If the pFile was opened read/write from unix-excl, then the only lock ever obtained is an exclusive lock, and it is obtained exactly once the first time any lock is attempted.
If the pSeg iterator is already at EOF, return 0.
If the pSelect argument is not NULL, it means that this routine was called to create a table generated from a  "CREATE TABLE ...
If the pSelect parameter is NULL, that means that the DEFAULT VALUES form of the INSERT statement is intended.
If the padFlag argument is not NULL then space padding at the end of strings is ignored.
If the page  has fewer than 2 siblings (something which can only happen if the page is a root page or a child of a root page) then all available siblings participate in the balancing.
If the page at *pOffset has already been played back (if the corresponding pDone bit is set) then skip the playback.
If the page being moved is dirty and has not been saved by the latest savepoint, then save the current contents of the page into the  sub-journal now.
If the page cannot be made clean for some other reason, but no error occurs, then SQLITE_OK is returned by sqlite3PcacheMakeClean() is not called.
If the page containing the entry to delete is not a leaf page, move the cursor to the largest entry in the tree that is smaller than the entry being deleted.
If the page footer is 0 bytes in size, then this field is the same as the size of the leaf page in bytes.
If the page is being rolled back as part of a savepoint (or statement) rollback from an  unsynced portion of the main journal file, then it is not safe to mark the page as clean.
If the page is clean and the reference count drops to 0, then it is made eligible for recycling.
If the page is not already in memory, this routine goes to disk to read it in whereas Lookup() just returns 0.
If the page is not journalled when it is moved to the free-list and it is also not journalled when it is extracted from the free-list and reused, then the original data may be lost.
If the page is written into one of the journals, the corresponding bit is set in the  Pager.pInJournal bitvec and the PagerSavepoint.pInSavepoint bitvecs of any open savepoints as appropriate.
If the page number of the page record read from the (sub-)journal file is greater than the current value of Pager.dbSize, then playback is skipped and SQLITE_OK is returned.
If the page previously located at pgno is not already in the rollback journal, it is not put there by by this routine.
If the page record is successfully read from the (sub-)journal file and played back, then SQLITE_OK is returned.
If the page requested is  already in the cache when this function is called, then the extra data is left as it was when the page object was last used.
If the page size is 65536 and the page is empty, the offset should be 65536, but the 2-byte value stores zero.
If the page size is changed, then this function uses sqlite3PagerMalloc()  to obtain a new Pager.pTmpSpace buffer.
If the page size is not changed, either because one of the enumerated conditions above is not true, the pager was in error state when this function was called, or because the memory allocation attempt failed,  then *pPageSize is set to the old, retained page size before returning.
If the page size supplied does not meet this constraint then the page size is not changed.
If the page was not in the hash table and createFlag is 0, abort.
If the pager has already entered the ERROR state, do not attempt  the rollback at this time.
If the pager has not already entered the ERROR state, but an IO or malloc error occurs during a rollback, then this will itself cause  the pager to enter the ERROR state.
If the pager is a temp-file pager and the actual file-system file is not yet open, it is created and opened before any data is  written out.
If the pager is already in PAGER_ERROR state when this function is called, it returns Pager.errCode immediately.
If the pager is already in exclusive-mode, the WAL module will use  heap-memory for the wal-index instead of the VFS shared-memory  implementation.
If the pager is already in the ERROR state, the rollback is not  attempted here.
If the pager is in  exclusive-locking mode when this function is called, take an EXCLUSIVE lock on the database file and use heap-memory to store the wal-index in.
If the pager is in CACHEMOD state, then there must be a copy of this page in the pager cache.
If the pager is in ERROR state when this function is called, the  contents of the pager cache are discarded before switching back to  the OPEN state.
If the pager is in WAL mode and the WAL file currently contains one or more frames, return the size in bytes of the page images stored within the WAL frames.
If the pager is in full-sync mode, the journal file descriptor is advanced to the next sector boundary before anything is written.
If the pager is in peristent-journal mode, then the physical  journal-file may extend past the end of the master-journal name and 8 bytes of magic data just written to the file.
If the pager is in the ERROR state and the call to unlock the database file fails, set the current lock to UNKNOWN_LOCK.
If the pager is in the error state when this function is called, it is a no-op.
If the pager is in the error state, return an error immediately.
If the pager is not in exclusive-access mode, the database file is completely unlocked.
If the pager is open on a temp-file (or in-memory database), or if the WAL file is already open, set *pbOpen to 1 and return SQLITE_OK without doing anything.
If the pager is operating in full-sync mode, then the journal file is synced before this field is updated.
If the pager is running in exclusive mode, this method of finalizing the journal file is never used.
If the pager object is allocated and the specified file opened  successfully, SQLITE_OK is returned and *ppPager set to point to the new pager object.
If the pager passed as the first argument is open on a real database file (not a temp file or an in-memory database), and the WAL file is not already open, make an attempt to open it now.
If the parameter does not exist, this routine returns a NULL pointer.
If the parameter is named, it will be removed and correctly disposed of by the hash_update call that follows
If the parameter is not _QUERY, then the locking-mode is set to the value specified.
If the parameter is zero, then URI handling is globally disabled.
If the parent does not exist, removing the child row resolves an  outstanding foreign key constraint violation.
If the parent is NULL then the class does not extend anything and thus parent does not make any sense, either.
If the parent key consists of a single column (the foreign key constraint is not a composite foreign key), output variable *paiCol is set to NULL.
If the parent key is an INTEGER PRIMARY  KEY column, then output variable *ppIdx is set to NULL.
If the parent page becomes overfull, the overflow cell or cells are stored in the pSpace buffer allocated immediately below.
If the parent row can be found, no  special action is taken.
If the parent table is the same as the child table, and we are about to increment the constraint-counter (i.e. this is an INSERT operation), then check if the row being inserted matches itself.
If the parent table of an FK constraint on the current table is missing, behave as if it is empty.
If the path name starts with a forward slash or a backslash, it is either a legal UNC name, a volume relative path, or an absolute path name in the "Unix" format on Windows.
If the path name starts with a letter and a colon it is either a volume relative path or an absolute path.
If the pattern was studied, a minimum subject length may be set.
If the pattern was successfully studied with JIT support, run the JIT executable instead of the rest of this function.
If the payload for a cell is larger than the max payload, then extra payload is spilled to overflow pages.
If the payload is larger than the preset amount then surplus bytes are stored on overflow pages.
If the payload will not fit completely on the local page, we have to decide how much to store locally and how much to spill onto overflow pages.
If the pgno argument passed to PTRMAP_PAGENO is a pointer-map page, then pgno is returned.
If the phrase instances in the column being considered do not overlap, this object simply iterates through them.
If the phrase is part of a NEAR expression, then only phrase instances that meet the NEAR constraint are included in the counts.
If the phrase pExpr consists entirely of deferred tokens, then all X and Y values are set to nDoc, where nDoc is the number of documents in the  file system.
If the pixel is transparent, we assign it the palette index that will later be added at the end of the palette as the transparent index.
If the pnByte parameter is NULL, then it is assumed that the file  contains a single PMA, and that that PMA omits the initial length varint.
If the position list contains entries for column iCol, then (*pa) is set to point to the sub-position-list for that column and the number of bytes in it returned.
If the power fails while the journal is being written, semi-random garbage data might appear in the journal file after power is restored.
If the previous chunk is checked out, then u.hdr.prevSize can be part of the data for that chunk and should not be read or written.
If the previous match was for an empty string, we are finished if we are at the end of the subject.
If the processing calls for the query to abort, this subroutine increments the iAbortFlag memory location before returning in order to signal the caller to abort.
If the progress callback returns non-zero, exit the virtual machine with a return code SQLITE_ABORT.
If the proper action on seeing token YYTOKEN is to reduce or to detect an error, take that action.
If the query has an ORDER BY, then entries in the Queue table are kept in ORDER BY order and the first entry is extracted for each cycle.
If the query is DISTINCT with an ORDER BY but is not an aggregate, and  if the select-list is the same as the ORDER BY list, then this query can be rewritten as a GROUP BY.
If the query planner's estimates was accurate, then this value will approximate the quotient NVISIT/NLOOP and the product of this value for all prior loops with the same SELECTID will be the NLOOP value for the current loop.
If the query runs to completion without incident, SQLITE_OK is returned.
If the query was read-only and the error code is SQLITE_INTERRUPT,  no rollback is necessary.
If the quotes were of the form "..." (double-quotes) then the EP_DblQuoted flag is set on the expression node.
If the rScore is a tie, then use iLevel as the tie breaker with smaller iLevel values coming first.
If the random rowid does exist, we select a new one and try again, up to 100 times.
If the range is given as strings, generate an array of characters.
If the rbu update has not started (i.e. the rbu_state table was empty) it is a no-op.
If the rbu_control field contains an invalid value, an error code and message are left in the RBU handle and zero returned.
If the realloc() is successful (i.e. if no OOM condition occurs), the space allocated for the new object is zeroed, *pnEntry updated to reflect the new size of the array and a pointer to the new allocation returned.
If the reallocation fails, then free p and set the mallocFailed flag in the database connection.
If the record identified by P3 and P4 contains any NULL value, jump immediately to P2.
If the record identified by P3 and P4 is a prefix of any entry in P1 then a jump is made to P2 and P1 is left pointing at the matching entry.
If the record identified by P3 and P4 is not the prefix of any entry in P1 then a jump is made to P2.
If the record is corrupt, the xRecordCompare routine may read up to two varints past the end of the buffer.
If the record number is not being modified, then regNewRowid is the same register as regOldRowid, which is already populated.
If the record number will change, set register regNewRowid to contain the new value.
If the reduce action popped at least one element off the stack, then we can push the new element back onto the stack here, and skip the stack overflow test in fts5yy_shift().
If the reduce action popped at least one element off the stack, then we can push the new element back onto the stack here, and skip the stack overflow test in yy_shift().
If the reference count has reached zero, rollback any active transaction and unlock the pager.
If the reference is followed by a COLLATE operator, then make sure the COLLATE operator is preserved.
If the reference is to a completed group, we need to detect whether this is a recursive call, as otherwise there will be an infinite loop.
If the regex permits duplicate names, the first substring that is set is chosen.
If the register is a temporary register that can be deallocated, then write its number into *pReg.
If the reneg_limit_callback returned true don't auto-close
If the requested collation sequence is not available, or not available in the database native encoding, the collation factory is invoked to request it.
If the requested page is already in the cache, it is returned.
If the requested page is already in the page cache, then the page cache implementation must return a pointer to the page buffer with its content intact.
If the requested page is not already in the pager cache return NULL.
If the requested reference is  successfully obtained, it is copied to *ppPage and SQLITE_OK returned.
If the required index cannot be found, either because:  1) The named parent key columns do not exist, or  2) The named parent key columns do exist, but are not subject to a UNIQUE or PRIMARY KEY constraint, or  3) No parent key columns were provided explicitly as part of the foreign key definition, and the parent table does not have a PRIMARY KEY, or  4) No parent key columns were provided explicitly as part of the foreign key definition, and the PRIMARY KEY of the parent table  consists of a different number of columns to the child key in  the child table.
If the resize fails, set the mallocFailed flag in the connection object.
If the response to a rowid conflict is REPLACE but the response to some other UNIQUE constraint is FAIL or IGNORE, then we need to defer the running of the rowid conflict checking until after the UNIQUE constraints have run.
If the result is a text value, the sqlite3_value object uses encoding  enc.
If the result register is not a temporary, then set *pReg to zero.
If the return value is 1, then ALWAYS() is either hard-coded to true or else it asserts if its argument is false.
If the return value is 2, that means ALWAYS() and NEVER() are both no-op pass-through macros, which is the default setting.
If the return value of sqlite3BtreeGetFilename() is a zero length string, it means the main database is :memory: or a temp file.
If the returned value is SQLITE_DONE, xQueryPhrase returns SQLITE_OK.
If the rhs of the LIKE expression is a variable, and the current value of the variable means there is no need to invoke the LIKE function, then no OP_Variable will be added to the program.
If the right-hand side is also a column, then the affinities of both right and left sides must be such that no type conversions are required on the right.
If the root node is the parent of the leaves, iRoot will be 1.
If the row was deleted out from under the cursor, set the cursor to point to a NULL row.
If the rowid column is modified by the UPDATE statement the bChngRowid argument is non-zero.
If the same database is attached more than once, the first attached database is returned.
If the same thread tries to enter any other kind of mutex more than once, the behavior is undefined.
If the same value is passed to multiple invocations of the same SQL function during query execution, under some circumstances the associated metadata may be preserved.
If the schema changes, these column names might changes and so the view will need to be reset.
If the schema cookie in P3 differs from the schema cookie in the database header or if the schema generation counter in P4 differs from the current generation counter, then an SQLITE_SCHEMA error is raised and execution halts.
If the schema-cookie from the database file matches the cookie  stored with the in-memory representation of the schema, do not reload the schema from the database file.
If the second argument is 2 or more and exclusive transaction is started, meaning that no other process is allowed to access the database.
If the second argument is SQLITE_FULL, SQLITE_IOERR or one of the IOERR sub-codes, the pager enters the ERROR state and the error code is stored in Pager.errCode.
If the second argument is not NULL, then its contents are prepended to  the returned expression text and then freed using sqlite3_free().
If the second argument to this function is NULL, generate a temporary file name to use
If the second argument to this function is NULL, the object is allocated by calling sqlite3ValueNew().
If the second argument were replaced with NULL, the "rbu" VFS would access the file-system via the system default VFS, bypassing the multiplexor.
If the second parameter is greater than 0 and the sub-journal is not already open, then it will be opened here.
If the second parameter is zero, then the cursor is left pointing at an arbitrary location after the delete.
If the sector size isn't a multiple of 512 then it isn't valid.
If the secure_delete option is enabled, then always fully overwrite deleted information with zeros.
If the seekResult parameter is 0, then cursor pCur may point to any entry or to no entry at all and so this function has to seek the cursor before the new key can be inserted.
If the seekResult parameter is non-zero, then a successful call to MovetoUnpacked() to seek cursor pCur to (pKey, nKey) has already been performed.
If the seekResult parameter is non-zero, then the caller guarantees that cursor pCur is pointing at the existing copy of a row that is to be overwritten.
If the segment fits entirely on a single leaf node, iRoot will be set to 0.
If the sequence counter is currently zero, jump to P2.
If the set  contains one or more NULL values, then the result of the expression is also NULL.
If the set contains no NULL values, then the result is 0.
If the set membership test fails, then the result of the  "x IN (...)" expression must be either 0 or NULL.
If the shared-data extension is enabled, there may be multiple users of the Btree structure.
If the shared-memory file has not yet been opened, open it now.
If the shared-memory region has already been allocated or is allocated by this call as described above, then it is mapped into this processes  address space (if it is not already), *pp is set to point to the mapped  memory and SQLITE_OK returned.
If the shared-memory region has already been allocated or is allocated by this call as described above, then it is mapped into this processes address space (if it is not already), *pp is set to point to the mapped memory and SQLITE_OK returned.
If the sibling pages are not leaves, ensure that the right-child pointer of the right-most new sibling page is set to the value that was  originally in the same field of the right-most old sibling page.
If the sibling pages are not leaves, then the pointer map entry  associated with the right-child of each sibling may also need to be  updated.
If the sixth argument to sqlite3_bind_text64() is not one of the allowed values shown above, or if the text encoding is different from the encoding specified by the sixth parameter, then the behavior is undefined.
If the size has changed, and this child has children we need to re-layout this child
If the size of the content area is extended, ppData is updated to point to the new start of the content area before returning.
If the size of the database file is not an integer multiple of the page-size, round up the result.
If the size of the value in blob pPrev is zero, then this is the first term written to the node.
If the skip extends beyond the data currently in the buffer, the buffer can be marked empty so that the next read will cause a fill_input_buffer call that can suspend.
If the socket was originally blocking, set it back.
If the sorter cursor key contains any NULL values, consider it to be less than pVal.
If the sorter is running in single-threaded mode, then all PMAs generated are appended to a single temporary file.
If the sorter uses more than one task, then create the top-level  MergeEngine here.
If the source page size is smaller than the destination page size,  round up.
If the source page-size is smaller than the destination page-size, two extra things may need to happen:  The destination may need to be truncated, and  Data stored on the pages immediately following the  pending-byte page in the source database may need to be copied into the destination database.
If the source pager is currently in a write-transaction, return SQLITE_BUSY immediately.
If the source-list item passed as an argument was augmented with an INDEXED BY clause, then try to locate the specified index.
If the specified term is found on the page, then the iterator is left pointing to it.
If the specified term is greater than or equal to the term from the interior node, then all terms on the sub-tree  headed by node iChild are smaller than zTerm.
If the sqlite3GlobalConfig.bLocaltimeFault variable is true then this routine will always fail.
If the sqlite3PcacheFetch() routine is unable to allocate a new page because new clean pages are available for reuse and the cache size limit has been reached, then this routine can be invoked to  try harder to allocate a page.
If the sqlite3_finalize() call indicates that an error occurs, and the rbu handle error code is not already set, set the error code and error message accordingly.
If the sqlite_sequence table exists in this database, then update  it with the new table name.
If the sqlite_stat1 table is not present in the database, SQLITE_ERROR is returned.
If the sqlite_stat1.idx column is NULL, then the sqlite_stat1.stat column contains a single integer which is the (estimated) number of rows in the table identified by sqlite_stat1.tbl.
If the sqlite_statN tables do not previously exist, it is created.
If the stack pointer reached the top (left the global function) increase the pointer and the top pointer.
If the start value lies in the current range, then simply set the new end point of the range to the end value passed as a parameter.
If the statement completed successfully, invoke the profile callback
If the statement is successfully recompiled, return SQLITE_OK.
If the statement journal is open and the page is not in it, then write the page into the statement journal.
If the statement that caused this trigger to fire had an explicit ON CONFLICT, then use it.
If the statement transaction is being rolled back, also restore the  database handles deferred constraint counter to the value it had when  the statement transaction was opened.
If the statement transaction needs to be rolled back, the value of this counter needs to be restored too.
If the stream buffer contains more data than the caller requested, we can also avoid that costly step and simply return that data.
If the stream ctx disables SNI we're finished here
If the stream position is not at the start, we need to force the stdio layer to believe it's real location.
If the stream was fopencookied, we must NOT touch anything here, as the cookied stream relies on it all.
If the string can be stored without allocating memory, then it is.
If the string is not an integer, just return 0.
If the string is too large (if it exceeds the SQLITE_LIMIT_LENGTH size limit) then no memory allocation occurs.
If the string zSignedIdent consists entirely of alpha-numeric characters, does not begin with a digit and is not an SQL keyword, then it is copied to the output buffer exactly as it is.
If the sub-journal was opened successfully (or was already open), write the journal record into the file.
If the subjInMemory argument is non-zero, then any sub-journal opened within this transaction will be opened as an in-memory file.
If the subjInMemory argument is zero, then any required sub-journal is implemented in-memory if pPager is an in-memory database,  or using a temporary file otherwise.
If the subpattern has no firstchar, set "none" for the whole branch.
If the subpattern set a required byte (or set a first byte that isn't really the first byte - see above), set it.
If the subquery gives a constant result, then iTable is -1.
If the subquery gives a different answer at different times during statement processing then iTable is the address of a subroutine that computes the subquery.
If the subquery has more than one element in its FROM clause, then expand the outer query to make space for it to hold all elements of the subquery.
If the subquery is not correlated and if we are not inside of a trigger, then we only need to compute the value of the subquery once.
If the subquery is the right term of a LEFT JOIN, then do not flatten.
If the subroutine is a forward reference, we can't deal with it until the end of the pattern, so return -3.
If the syscall fails, we are doomed.
If the system is so sick that we are unable to allocate a mutex, there is not much SQLite is going to be able to do.
If the table already has a primary key (and this is the second primary key) then create an error.
If the table being dropped is the table with the largest root-page number in the database, put the root page on the free list.
If the table being written  has no PRIMARY KEY, affected rows must be identified by rowid.
If the table cannot be found, an error code is returned and the output variables are undefined.
If the table has a virtual root page, then the cursor is moved to point to the virtual root page instead of the actual root page.
If the table has an INTEGER PRIMARY KEY column and that column is named in the IDLIST, then record in the ipkColumn variable the index into IDLIST of the primary key column.
If the table has an explicit IPK, use its name.
If the table identified by  FROM clause element pItem is really a common-table-expression (CTE)  then return a pointer to the CTE definition for that table.
If the table is not located in the temp-db (in which case NULL is  returned, loop through the tables list of triggers.
If the table or index is empty, jump immediately to P2.
If the table or index is not empty, fall through to the following  instruction.
If the target database table has an INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, it is not  possible to insert a NULL value into the IPK column.
If the target database table is a virtual table or a table with no PRIMARY KEY, the rbu_control value should not include a character corresponding  to the rbu_rowid value.
If the target encoding was unknown, fail
If the target encoding was unknown, or no decoder function was specified, return the UTF-8-encoded data as-is.
If the target table column is an "INTEGER PRIMARY KEY", add "PRIMARY KEY" to the imposter table column declaration.
If the temp database has been explicitly named as part of the  pragma, make sure it is open.
If the term has an alias, then pAlias points to the alias token.
If the term is a subquery, then pSubquery is the SELECT statement that the subquery encodes.
If the text contains no host parameters, return the total number of bytes in the text.
If the third argument is non-NULL, then this function releases a  reference obtained by an earlier call to unixFetch().
If the third argument is non-NULL, then this function releases a reference obtained by an earlier call to winFetch().
If the third parameter is less than -1 or greater than 127 then the behavior is undefined.
If the third parameter, discard, is non-zero, then the page must be evicted from the cache.
If the thread was impersonating already, this function uses that impersonation context.
If the title case character is empty, then make it the same as the upper case.
If the title case character is not present, then make it the same as the upper case.
If the tokenization was abandoned early because the callback returned SQLITE_DONE, this is not an error and this function still returns SQLITE_OK.
If the transaction count  reaches 0, set the shared state to TRANS_NONE.
If the transaction counter is modified, record that fact too.
If the transaction counter is not updated, other connections to the same file might not realize that the file has changed and hence might not know to flush their cache.
If the transaction is committed or rolled back while  in WRITER_LOCKED state, all that is required is to unlock the database  file.
If the transition out of exclusive-mode is successful, return 1.
If the translation is between UTF-16 little and big endian, then  all that is required is to swap the byte order.
If the trigger name was unqualified, and the table is a temp table, then set iDb to 1 to create the trigger in the temporary database.
If the two checksums are identical, the integrity-check is deemed to have passed.
If the two statements contain a different number of bindings, then an SQLITE_ERROR is returned.
If the two values are of different types, then numbers are considered less than strings and strings are considered less than blobs.
If the two values were equal, then the value from the oldest PMA should be considered smaller.
If the underlying stream operations block when no new data is readable, we need to take extra precautions.
If the unlock operation fails as well, then the first error code related to the first error encountered (the journal finalization one) is returned.
If the upper layer is doing a rollback, it is guaranteed that there are no outstanding references to any page other than page 1.
If the useJournal flag is clear, the journal-mode must be "OFF".
If the user decided to close the statement right after execute() We have to call the appropriate use_result() or store_result() and clean.
If the user didn't specify a width or height, and it has not been set by the container, then we set it via the children.
If the user does have a later shutdown function which needs the session then tough luck.
If the user explicitly specified a likelihood() value for this term, then the return value is the likelihood multiplied by the number of input rows.
If the user has configured a chunk-size for this file, truncate the file so that it consists of an integer number of chunks (i.e. the actual file size after the operation may be larger than the requested size).
If the user has not indicated to use localtime_r() or localtime_s() already, check for an MSVC build environment that provides  localtime_s().
If the user specified a negative value for the languageid, use zero instead.
If the user then queries for '1st + place', the tokenizer substitutes "first" for "1st" and the query works as expected.
If the user wants to store the data and we have BLOBs/TEXTs we try to allocate not the maximal length of the type (which is 16MB even for LONGBLOB) but the maximal length of the field in the result set.
If the vacuum has finished, jump to instruction P2.
If the value in  register P1 is zero, then the result is NULL.
If the value in "options" is zero, it just means we have found all possible matches, so the loop ends.
If the value in P1 is NULL then take the jump if and only if P3 is non-zero.
If the value in register P1 is  NULL, then a NULL is stored in P2.
If the value in register P1 is zero the result is NULL.
If the value in register P3 is not NULL, then this routine is a no-op.
If the value is a string or blob, then the copy is only a pointer to the original and hence if the original changes so will the copy.
If the value is being opened for writing, check that the column is not indexed, and that it is not part of a foreign key.
If the value of P is something other than an integer, then zero is returned.
If the value of register P1 is 1 or greater, subtract P3 from the value in P1 and jump to P2.
If the value of register P1 is not positive (if it is less than 1) then set the value of register P2 to be the integer P3.
If the value of the stack variable bDescDoclist is 0 when this macro is invoked, then it returns (i1-i2).
If the value passed as the third argument is a blob of size sizeof(Fts3Cursor*), then the blob contents are copied to the  output variable *ppCsr and SQLITE_OK is returned.
If the value passed is SQLITE_TRANSIENT, then the  string is copied into a (possibly existing) buffer managed by the  Mem structure.
If the virtual table pVtab supports the transaction interface (xBegin/xRollback/xCommit and optionally xSync) and a transaction is not currently open, invoke the xBegin method now.
If the wal-header appears to be corrupt, try to reconstruct the wal-index from the WAL before returning.
If the wal-index header is still malformed even while holding a WRITE lock, it can only mean that the header is corrupted and needs to be reconstructed.
If the wal-index header is successfully read, return SQLITE_OK.
If the word contains digits, 3 bytes are taken from the beginning and 3 bytes from the end.
If the word ends with zFrom and xCond() is true for the stem of the word that preceeds the zFrom ending, then change the  ending to zTo.
If the word was quoted, *pbQuoted is also set to 1 before returning.

If the workspace had to be expanded, free the new memory.
If the write version is set to 2, this database should be accessed in WAL mode.
If the writeOnly flag is true and an error is encountered while  saving the current position of a read-only cursor, all cursors,  including all read-cursors are tripped.
If the writeOnly flag is true, then only write-cursors need be tripped - read-only cursors save their current positions so that they may continue  following the rollback.
If the wtFlags argument includes TERM_DYNAMIC, then responsibility for freeing the expression p is assumed by the WhereClause object pWC.
If the xBegin call is successful, place the sqlite3_vtab pointer in the sqlite3.aVTrans array.
If the xBestIndex method sets this flag, SQLite assumes that the strategy may visit at most one row.

If the xFileControl(FCNTL_SIZE_HINT) method is called, dbHintSize is increased to the number of pages that correspond to the size-hint passed to the method call.
If the xMutexAlloc method has not been set, then the user did not install a mutex implementation via sqlite3_config() prior to  sqlite3_initialize() being called.
If the xSectorsize() method  returns a value larger than this, then MAX_SECTOR_SIZE is used instead.
If the xSleep() method of the default VFS is not implemented correctly, or not implemented at all, then the behavior of sqlite3_sleep() may deviate from the description in the previous paragraphs.
If the zFilename parameter to xOpen is a NULL pointer then xOpen must invent its own temporary name for the file.
If the zMask string does not specify any columns to update, then this is not an error.
If the zNum value is representable as a 64-bit twos-complement  integer, then write that value into *pNum and return 0.
If the zState argument is passed a NULL value, the RBU extension stores  the current state of the update (how many rows have been updated, which  indexes are yet to be updated etc.) within the RBU database itself.
If the zval is not a GMP instance, then we try to convert the value to a temporary gmp number using convert_to_gmp.

If there has been exactly one prior match and this match is for the right-hand table of a NATURAL JOIN or is in a  USING clause, then skip this match.
If there is a "*-oal" file in the file-system corresponding to the target database in the file-system, delete it.
If there is a GROUP BY clause we might need a sorting index to implement it.
If there is a LIMIT clause, the parser sets nLimit to the value of the limit and nOffset to the value of the offset (or 0 if there is not offset).

If there is an ORDER BY clause, then we need to sort the results and send them to the callback one by one.
If there is an action associated with the FK  for this operation (either update or delete), invoke the associated  trigger sub-program.
If there is an error in the Parse structure, set the return code to 1.
If there is an escape character E,   A LIKE B ESCAPE E  is mapped to like(B, A, E).

If there is anything other than a rowset object in memory cell P1, delete it now and initialize P1 with an empty rowset
If there is at least one such segment, and it is possible to determine that all  such segments are smaller than nLimit bytes in size, they will be  promoted to level iAbsLevel.
If there is both a GROUP BY and an ORDER BY clause and they are identical, then it may be possible to disable the ORDER BY clause  on the grounds that the GROUP BY will cause elements to come out  in the correct order.
If there is both a MATCH constraint and a direct rowid/docid lookup, prefer the MATCH strategy.
If there is both an upper and lower bound specified, and the  comparisons indicate that they are close together, use the fallback method (assume that the scan visits 1/64 of the rows) for estimating the number of rows visited.
If there is buffered data available, we check for a EOL.
If there is cached matchinfo() data, but the format string for the  cache does not match the format string for this request, discard  the cached data.
If there is data, jump to P2
If there is enough space between gap and top for one more cell pointer array entry offset, and if the freelist is not empty, then search the freelist looking for a free slot big enough to satisfy the request.
If there is insufficient space allocated at StrBuffer.z, use realloc() to grow the buffer until so that it is big enough to accomadate the appended data.
If there is insufficient space in *ppFrom to satisfy the request, then increment *pnByte by the amount of the request.

If there is not currently a writer, then BTS_PENDING must be zero already.
If there is not enough free space in pNode, return SQLITE_FULL.
If there is not, return SQLITE_OK.
If there is only one branch in a condition, the implied branch has zero length, so we don't add anything.

If there is space in the offset vector, set any unused pairs at the end of the pattern to -1 for backwards compatibility.
If there is space, set up the whole thing as substring 0.
If there is still no match, the next context is checked.
If there is, and that master journal file does not exist, then the journal file is not really hot.
If there is, do not consider the lookup-by-rowid plan as using such a plan would require the VDBE to evaluate the MATCH constraint, which is not currently possible.
If there is, then we consider this journal to be hot.
If there isn't enough space in the offset vector, treat this as if it were a non-capturing bracket.
If there was a master journal and this routine will return success, see if it is possible to delete the master journal.
If there was an INDEXED BY clause, then only that one index is considered.

If there was no match we are going to append the pattern if GLOB_NOCHECK was specified or if GLOB_NOMAGIC was specified and the pattern did not contain any magic characters GLOB_NOMAGIC is there just for compatibility with csh.
If there was no matching node at this level, we need to allocate an intersitial node (or the actual node if we're at the last part of the HDF name)
If there was no return value then just execute the query
If there was no return value then just skip fetching
If there was such a clause and the named index cannot be found, return  SQLITE_ERROR and leave an error in pParse.
If there were FTS5_MIN_DLIDX_SIZE or more empty leaf pages written to the database, also write the doclist-index to disk.
If there were a failure, the prepared statement would have halted before reaching this instruction.
If there were any lookbehind assertions that contained OP_RECURSE (recursions or subroutine calls), a flag is set for them to be checked here, because they may contain forward references.
If there were no changes, this block is skipped.
If there were no rowids on the leaf page either and the doclist-index has already been started, append an 0x00 byte to it.
If there were other file descriptors on this file, then no malloc would be required by findInodeInfo().
If there's no first char and the pattern was studied, there may be a bitmap of possible first characters.
If there's no object associated then there's nothing to dispose of
If there's nothing to read, wait in 10ms periods.
If there's only one element, then it's bigger than the content and needs its own line
If they actually want to perform the conversion, we need to switch the memory stream to a tmpfile stream
If they all start with OP_SOD or OP_CIRC, or with a bracket all of whose alternatives start with OP_SOD or OP_CIRC (recurse ad lib), then it's anchored.
If they are both enabled, then STAT4 takes precedence.
If they are called while some other thread is calling backup_step() or backup_finish(), the values returned may be invalid.
If they are if we can be a FILE*, say yes because we can perform the conversion.
If they are invoked at the same time as another thread is invoking sqlite3_backup_step() it is possible that they return invalid values.
If they are sorted in ascending  order, it should be passed a non-zero value.
If they are sorted in ascending order, it should be passed a non-zero value.
If they are the same, zero is returned.
If they are zero, they must not be registers.
If they do not match the  magic string found at the start of each journal header, return SQLITE_DONE.
If this  means that there is a hot-journal left in the file-system, the next  connection to obtain a shared lock on the pager (which may be this one)  will roll it back.
If this 'overflow' page happens to be a page that the caller is iterating through or using in some other way, this can be problematic.
If this Btree is a candidate for shared cache, try to find an existing BtShared object that we can share with
If this DELETE cannot use the ONEPASS strategy, this is the  end of the WHERE loop
If this allocation attempt  fails, SQLITE_NOMEM is returned and the page size remains unchanged.
If this array still has elements, add the current one to the parameter list, otherwise use null value.
If this assert() ever fires, it probably means that the KeyInfo.nField or KeyInfo.nXField values were computed incorrectly.
If this block is freed, we still have (allocated_size / 2) free space.
If this call is successful, *ppPage is set to point to the wal-index page and SQLITE_OK is returned.
If this call is to check if a *-wal file associated with an RBU target database connection exists, and the RBU update is in RBU_STAGE_OAL, the following special handling is activated:  a) if the *-wal file does exist, return SQLITE_CANTOPEN.

If this condition is true then the largest rowid for the current term may not be stored on the current page.
If this connection writes to the database file, it will do so using an in-memory journal.
If this constraint cannot be satisfied by any child within the node, set *peWithin to NOT_WITHIN.
If this constraint is not satisfied, it means that the high-speed vdbeRecordCompareInt() and vdbeRecordCompareString() routines will not work correctly.
If this constraint is not satisfied, set *peWithin to NOT_WITHIN.
If this cursor is opened using  the 'hint' parameters, it is possible that there are less than nSeg segments available in level iAbsLevel.
If this cursor was opened expecting an index b-tree, then the caller should be inserting blob keys with no associated data.
If this database is not shareable, or if the client is reading and has the read-uncommitted flag set, then no lock is required.
If this database supports auto-vacuum and iPage is not the last page in this overflow list, check that the pointer-map entry for the following page matches iPage.
If this doesn't work,  an equivalent collating sequence that uses a text encoding different from the main database is substituted, if one is available.

If this function fails, close the mcrypt module to prevent crashes when further functions want to access this resource
If this function is being called as part of an xConnect(), then the rtree table already exists.
If this function is called with parameters that attempt to write past the end of the existing data, no modifications are made and SQLITE_CORRUPT is returned.
If this group is at or above the current highwater mark, ensure that any groups between the current high water mark and this group are marked unset and then update the high water mark.
If this happens a hot-journal may be mistaken for a journal being created by an active transaction in another process, causing SQLite to read from the database without rolling it back.
If this happens in exclusive  mode, then subsequent transactions performed by the connection will not update the change-counter at all.
If this happens, it is almost certain that an open() call on the same path will also fail.
If this happens, it is the responsibility of the caller to invoke the correct balancing routine to fix this problem (see the balance() routine).
If this happens, return SQLITE_IOERR_RDLOCK.
If this happens, return non-zero.
If this happens, the next iteration of the do-loop will balance pParent  use either balance_nonroot() or balance_deeper().

If this has to be a scalar SELECT.
If this image is the result of alpha channel blending, it will not contain an interesting alpha channel itself.
If this instruction attempts to get a read lock but fails, the script terminates with an SQLITE_BUSY error code.

If this is a release of the outermost savepoint, truncate  the sub-journal to zero bytes in size.
If this is a rollback of a savepoint and data was not written to the database and the page is not in-memory, there is a potential problem.
If this is a savepoint rollback, then memory may have to be dynamically allocated by this function.
If this is a scalar select that is part of an expression, then store the results in the appropriate memory cell and break out of the scan loop.
If this is a scan, then this call must be being made by an fts4aux module, not an FTS table.
If this is a temp-file, it is possible that the journal file has not yet been opened.
If this is a view, then the only effect this statement has is to fire the INSTEAD OF  triggers.

If this is an SQLITE_CHECKPOINT_RESTART or TRUNCATE operation, and the entire wal file has been copied into the database file, then block  until all readers have finished using the wal file.
If this is an auto-vacuum database, the call to copyNodeContent()  sets all pointer-map entries corresponding to database image pages  for which the pointer is stored within the content being copied.
If this is an auto-vacuum database, update the pointer map with entries for the new page, and any pointer from the  cell on the page to an overflow page.
If this is an auto-vacuum database, update the pointer-map entries for any b-tree or overflow pages that pTo now contains the pointers to.
If this is an in-memory db, or no pages have been written to, or this function has already been called, it is mostly a no-op.
If this is an insert into a table b-tree, invalidate any incrblob  cursors open on the row being replaced
If this is an xCreate call, create the underlying tables in the  database.
If this is called we are either in a TIFFs thumbnail or a JPEG where we cannot handle it
If this is greater than the usable-size of the page, then the page must be corrupted.
If this is not a possibly empty group, and there are no (*THEN)s in the pattern, and this is the final alternative, optimize as described above.
If this is not a view, open the table and and all indices
If this is not currently true, make it true by defining or undefining NDEBUG.
If this is not done, then an unsynced portion of the open journal  file may be played back into the database.
If this is not the case, return an SQLITE_CORRUPT error.
If this is not the case, the format is changed in two ways:  + if the first rowid on a page occurs before the first term, it is stored as a literal value:  varint:  first rowid  + the first term on each page is stored in the same way as the very first term of the segment:  varint : size of first term blob:    first term data  5.
If this is not the first branch, the first char and reqchar have to match the values from all the previous branches, except that if the previous value for reqchar didn't have REQ_VARY set, it can still match, and we set REQ_VARY for the regex.
If this is not the first segment, 'pseg' will be nonzero.
If this is not the root-page, then the moveToChild() routine would have already detected db corruption.

If this is the case and an allocation fails, SQLITE_NOMEM is returned.
If this is the case, clear the mallocFailed flag and return NULL.
If this is the case, it is quite safe to close handle h - as it is guaranteed that no posix locks will be released by doing so.
If this is the case, then an entry with a matching TriggerPrg.pTrigger field will be present somewhere in the Parse.pTriggerPrg list.
If this is the case, then search for the closing quote and pass the whole string to getNextString() for processing.
If this is the case, then the pointer map needs to be updated for the subsequent overflow page.

If this is the magic sqlite_sequence table used by autoincrement, then record a pointer to this table in the main database structure so that INSERT can find the table easily.
If this is the right table of a LEFT OUTER JOIN, allocate and initialize a memory cell that records if this table matches any row of the left table of the join.
If this is to be the first rowid written to the page, set the  rowid-pointer in the page-header.

If this leaves 0 positions, zero is returned.
If this line is _longer_ than MAXLINELEN, remember it.
If this lock is not acquired first, then the caller may end up attempting to take this lock as part of committing a transaction, causing SQLite to return SQLITE_LOCKED or  LOCKED_SHAREDCACHEto a COMMIT command.
If this loop satisfies a sort order (pOrderBy) request that  was passed to this function to implement a "SELECT min(x) ..."  query, then the caller will only allow the loop to run for a single iteration.
If this match does not  * succeed, we still stay in the loop, advancing by just one character.
If this match succeeds, an alternative to the empty string   * match has been found, and we can print it and proceed round the loop,  * advancing by the length of whatever was found.
If this maximum height is greater than the current value pointed to by pnHeight, the second parameter, then set *pnHeight to that value.
If this means that the phrase does not appear in the current row, doclist.pList and doclist.nList are both zeroed.
If this means the iterator points to a value laster than *piLast, update *piLast to the new lastest value.
If this means there are no entries in the position list, nothing is appended to the buffer (not even iDelta).
If this message is triggered you should increase the ZEND_MMAP_AHEAD value in the zend_streams.h file

If this scan uses an index, make VDBE code substitutions to read data from the index instead of from the table where possible.
If this statement has violated immediate foreign key constraints, do not return the number of rows modified.
If this table is used instead of the above one, some of the special cases for the NEL character can be taken out of the code.
If this trigger has been fired before, then pRt  is already allocated.

If this where not the case, on of the following assert()s would fail.
If this will satisfy the client, set the orderByConsumed flag so that  SQLite does not do an external sort.
If token pTok does not contain "NEAR", store an error in the pParse object.
If tokenizers are to be allowed to call sqlite3_*() functions, then we will need a way to register the API consistently.
If total space requirements never exceed n then no memory allocations ever occur.
If tracing is enabled (by the sqlite3_trace()) interface, then the UTF-8 string contained in P4 is emitted on the trace callback.
If triggers are not supported by this compile then the statement machine used to detect the end of a statement is much simpler
If tripCode is not SQLITE_OK then cursors will be invalidated (tripped).
If tripCode is not SQLITE_OK, then any write cursors are invalidated ("tripped" - as in "tripping a circuit breaker") and made to return tripCode if there are any further attempts to use that cursor.

If we are already within a transaction, then a checkpoint is set if the setStatement parameter is true.
If we are at the end of a nested substitution, revert to the outer level string.
If we are at the end of a scan line, set curx back to the beginning If we are interlaced, bump the cury to the appropriate spot, otherwise, just increment it.

If we are at the end of the subject, give up immediately.
If we are at the start of a conditional assertion group, *both* the conditional assertion *and* what follows the condition must satisfy the test for start of line.
If we are creating a set for an "expr IN (SELECT ...)" construct, then there should be a single item on the stack.
If we are doing a different kind of flattening - a flattening other than a compound-subquery flattening - then this loop only runs once.
If we are doing a normal write to a database file (as opposed to doing a hot-journal rollback or a write to some file other than a normal database file) and we truncate the file to zero length, that effectively updates the change counter.
If we are doing a normal write to a database file (as opposed to doing a hot-journal rollback or a write to some file other than a normal database file) then record the fact that the database has changed.
If we are doing a reverse order scan on an ascending index, or a forward order scan on a descending index, interchange the  start and end terms (pRangeStart and pRangeEnd).
If we are drawing this AA, then redraw the border with AA lines.
If we are going to print something, make sure that we have a separator first.
If we are going to print something, we'll need to print a blank before we print something else.
If we are holding a PENDING lock that ought to be released, then release it now.
If we are in a UTF mode, it may be a multi-unit literal character.
If we are in a negated POSIX class within a non-negated overall class, characters with code points greater than 255 must all match.
If we are in the pre-compile phase, accumulate the length used for the previous cycle of this loop.
If we are not at the pattern start, reset the greedy defaults and the case value for firstchar and reqchar.
If we are not in a pool, we cannot expand this name now
If we are not using shared cache, then there is no need to use mutexes to access the BtShared structures.
If we are on an architecture with mixed-endian floating  points (ex: ARM7) then swap the lower 4 bytes with the  upper 4 bytes.
If we are rereading the sqlite_master table create the in-memory record of the table.
If we are returning a large unsigned value, we have to convert it back to a string since PHP only supports signed values.
If we are returning a single result, just do it.
If we are the only user, then take this opportunity to set the max.
If we are to be thread-safe, include the pthreads header and define the SQLITE_UNIX_THREADS macro.
If we are too close to the start to move back, this match function fails.
If we are trying to delete from a view, realize that view into an ephemeral table.
If we are trying to update a view, realize that view into an ephemeral table.
If we are unable to rollback, quit and return the error code.
If we are unable to satisfy all memory requirements by reusing the opcode array tail, then the second pass will fill in the rest using a fresh allocation.
If we are unsure of the base, it indicates that we are in base 8 or base 16 (if it is followed by an 'x').
If we are using XPG specifiers, make sure that we grow to a large enough size.
If we are, we also want to check whether we've finished activating the modules (RINIT phase).
If we assume that writing a single disk sector is atomic, then this mode provides assurance that the journal will not be corrupted to the point of causing damage to the database during rollback.
If we backed up to a THEN, check whether it is within the current branch by comparing the address of the THEN that is passed back with the end of the branch.
If we can CWD to it, it's a directory (maybe a link, but we can't tell)
If we can't find the required character, break the matching loop, forcing a match failure.
If we can't obtain a timestamp (that means file is possibly socket) we won't cache it
If we cannot prove that the expressions are identical, we return 2 just to be safe.
If we cloned a document then we must create new doc proxy
If we come here, output unbound LONG and/or BINARY column data to the client
If we compile with SQLITE_OMIT_TRIGGER, all of the computation needed to recognize the end of a trigger can be omitted.
If we compile with the SQLITE_TEST macro set, then the following block of code will give us the ability to simulate a disk I/O error.
If we compiled with the SQLITE_NO_SYNC flag, then syncing is a no-op
If we created a new conch file (not just updated the contents of a  valid conch file), try to match the permissions of the database
If we didn't do anything on the last loop (or an error) check to see if we should retry or exit.
If we didn't get any error, then let's return it to PHP.
If we didn't, then this is unexpected.
If we disabled in (1), we'd get the wrong answer.
If we do attempt to use such a constraint, some rows might be repeated in the output.
If we do it after free_reference/dtor then we might crash
If we do not block illegal combinations here, it could trigger assert() statements in deeper layers.
If we do not compact here, then the lazy deletion of files (https://reviews.facebook.net/D6123) would leave around deleted files and the repair process will find those files and put them back into the database.
If we do not do this and we encounter a power failure, the directory entry for the journal might not exist after we reboot.
If we don't have free slots in the buffer, allocate a new one and set it's address to GC_ROOT_BUFFER_MAX_ENTRIES that have special meaning.
If we encounter a duplicate cookie name, we should skip it, since it is not possible to have the same (plain text) cookie name for the same path and we should not overwrite more specific cookies with the less specific ones.
If we end up here we didn't find a position for "charset_token", so we need to set it to the start of the yet unextracted data.
If we end up here, we should report an error back to the DB engine, but that's not possible.
If we end up with a forward reference, first check that the bracket does occur later so we can give the error (and position) now.
If we find that a given named parameter has been used twice, we will raise an error, as we can't be sure that it is safe to bind multiple parameters onto the same zval in the underlying driver
If we follow the usual indentation conventions, each case should be indented by 6 spaces.
If we get here it means the result set contains one or more "*" operators that need to be expanded.
If we get here, they have the same number of integer digits.
If we get this (the above doesn't check) then we'll retry as well.
If we get this far, it means that the reader will want to use the WAL to get at content from recent commits.
If we get this far, it means that the xfer optimization is at least a possibility, though it might only work if the destination table (tab1) is initially empty.
If we get this far, it means we need to compute the table names.
If we get to the end of the branch, check the length against that of the other branches.
If we get to this point, the path name should almost certainly be a purely relative one (i.e. not a UNC name, not absolute, and not volume relative).
If we got a pconnection stub, then 'load'(OCISessionGet) the real connection from its private spool A connection is a stub if it is only a cached structure and the real connection is released to its underlying private session pool.
If we got any data, don't worry about it.
If we had a 'transparent' color, increment the color count so it's officially in the palette and convert the transparent variable to point to an index rather than a color (Its data already exists and transparent pixels have already been mapped to it by this point, it is done late as to avoid color matching / dithering with it).
If we had a pure transparency color, add it as the last palette entry.
If we had a thumbnail in a SUB_IFD we have ANOTHER image in NEXT IFD
If we have HOWMANY bytes, it indicates that the data might have been truncated, probably even before this function was called.
If we have Unicode property support, we can use it to test the other case of the character, if there is one.
If we have a redirect_url then our script_filename and script_name point to the php executable
If we have a timeout to check, figure out how much time has elapsed since we started.
If we have a timeout, we switch to non-blocking mode for the duration of the operation, using select to do our waits.
If we have a transparent color (the alphaless mode of transparency), we must reserve a palette entry for it at the end of the palette.
If we have already a handler, release it
If we have already seen an xclass item or one may follow (we have to assume that it might if this is not the end of the class), explicitly match all wide codepoints.
If we have any lock, then the lock file already exists.
If we have determined that we need to deviate from the correct algorithm, flip bit 16 in initial expanded key.
If we have fewer than 2 bytes, give up.
If we have found the required character, save the point where we found it, so that we don't search again next time round the loop if the start hasn't passed this character yet.
If we have just passed a CR and the newline option is ANY or ANYCRLF, and we are now at a LF, advance the match position by one more character.
If we have matched a delimiter
If we have matched an empty string, fail if not in an assertion and not in a recursion if either PCRE_NOTEMPTY is set, or if PCRE_NOTEMPTY_ATSTART is set and we have matched at the start of the subject.
If we have matched an empty string, mimic what Perl's /g options does.
If we have more than 2 NOPS then JMP over them
If we have not already resolved the name, then maybe  it is a new.* or old.* trigger argument reference
If we have not found this recursion on the forward reference list, adjust the recursion's offset if it's after the start of this group.
If we have not seen this color before, find nearest colormap
If we have not seen this color before, find nearest colormap entry
If we have not yet set a firstchar in this branch, take it from the subpattern, remembering that it was set here so that a repeat of more than one can replicate it as reqchar if necessary.
If we have something like C:
If we have tried all the alternative branches, the assertion has failed.
If we haven't matched any alternatives in any iteration, check to see if a previous iteration matched.
If we haven't read everything
If we haven't registered a server_context yet, then don't bother flushing.
If we hit ALT or KET, it means we haven't found anything mandatory in this branch, though we might have found something optional.
If we hit a bracket or a positive lookahead assertion, recurse to set bits from within the subpattern.
If we hit an unclosed bracket, we return "empty" - this means we've struck an inner bracket whose current branch will already have been scanned.
If we hit the duplicate rowid constraint (or any other error) while doing so, return immediately.
If we meet some day, and you think this stuff is worth it, you can buy me a beer in return.
If we might modify it, we continue to scan the tag, otherwise we simply copy the complete HTML stuff to the result buffer.
If we previously had a firstchar, but it doesn't match the new branch, we have to abandon the firstchar for the regex, but if there was previously no reqchar, it takes on the value of the old firstchar.
If we previously set PCRE_NOTEMPTY_ATSTART after a null match, this is not necessarily the end.
If we reach something we don't understand, it means a new opcode has been created that hasn't been added to this code.
If we reach the end of the pattern without matching, display a warning.
If we reach this line, isc_wait_for_event() did return, but we don't know which event fired.
If we reach this point, flattening is permitted.
If we reach this point, it means that execution is finished with an error of some kind.
If we reach this point, it means that pExpr refers to a table that is in the FROM clause of the aggregate query.
If we reach this point, it means that the database connection has closed all sqlite3_stmt and sqlite3_backup objects and has been passed to sqlite3_close (meaning that it is a zombie).
If we reach this point, it means the two subterms can be combined
If we reach this point, that means the transformation is required.
If we reach this point, the frame is valid.
If we reach this points it means that the new candidate path needs to be added to the set of best-so-far paths.
If we see any continuations at a higher level, process them.
If we see that the page does not contain a well-formed database page, then return  SQLITE_CORRUPT.
If we see whitespace in the format, skip whitespace in the string.
If we set a first char from the group, and didn't set a required char, copy the latter from the former.
If we succeed, we return non-zero and the NetWare Loader will leave us up, otherwise we fail to load and get dumped.
If we succeeded in making the shared memory handle, map it.
If we time out, or we have an error report that back to PHP
If we were called via fclose, the cookie_closer unsets the fclose_stdiocast flags, so we can be sure that we only reach here when PHP code calls php_stream_free.
If we write nothing to this pointer-map slot, then the optimistic overflow chain processing in clearCell() may misinterpret the uninitialized values and delete the wrong pages from the database.
If we're going to overwrite the argv area, count the available space.
If we're in compile time, in practice, it's quite possible that we'll never reach this class declaration at runtime, so we shut up about it.
If we're not and __call() handler exists, invoke it, otherwise error out.
If we're out of colors, go for the closest color
If we've a valid pointer, return the SMTP server response so the error message contains more information
If we've found a possible browser, we need to do a comparison of the number of characters changed in the user agent being checked versus the previous match found and the current match.
If where.c is able to produce results sorted in this order, then add vdbe code to break out of the processing loop after the  first iteration (since the first iteration of the loop is  guaranteed to operate on the row with the minimum or maximum  value of x, the only row required).
If while inserting cells into the parent page (pParent) the parent page becomes overfull, this buffer is used to store the parent's overflow cells.
If work was actually accomplished...
If wrOnly is false then all cursors are counted.
If writable static data is unsupported on the target, we have to locate the state vector at run-time.
If writing out a page causes the database file to grow, Pager.dbFileSize is updated accordingly.
If writing this  page caused the database file to grow, update dbFileSize.
If writing to memory or generating a set only a single column may be output.
If x is a blob, then we count bytes.
If x is a lower-case ASCII character, then its upper-case equivalent is (x - 0x20).
If x is text, then we actually count UTF-8 characters.
If xAccess() is called to check if there exists a *-wal file  associated with an RBU target database currently in RBU_STAGE_OAL stage (preparing the *-oal file), the following special handling applies:  if the *-wal file does exist, return SQLITE_CANTOPEN.
If xInit is not on the list, then this routine is a no-op.
If xMutexInit fails in any way, it is expected to clean up after itself prior to returning.
If xOpen() is called from a different process id, indicating that a fork() has occurred, the PRNG will be reset.
If xRead() returns SQLITE_IOERR_SHORT_READ it must also fill in the unread portions of the buffer with zeros.
If xRoundup returns 0,  that causes the corresponding memory allocation to fail.
If xclass_has_prop is false and class_one_char is 1, we have the first single character in the class, and there have been no prior ranges, or XCLASS items generated by escapes.

If your stack is a linked list of frames, you have to provide an "address metric" ADDRESS_FUNCTION macro.
If z is a NULL pointer, set pMem to contain an SQL NULL.
If zDatabase is 0, all databases are searched for the table and the first matching index is returned.
If zDatabase is 0, all databases are searched for the table and the first matching table is returned.
If zDb is NULL, or if the buffer zDb points to contains a zero-length string, all attached databases are  checkpointed.
If zFilename is ":memory:" then  all information is held in cache.
If zFilename is ":memory:" then an in-memory database is created that is automatically destroyed when it is closed.
If zFilename is NULL then a randomly-named temporary file is created and used as the file to be cached.
If zFilename is NULL then an ephemeral database is created.
If zKey is NULL, then this foreign key is implicitly mapped to  the PRIMARY KEY of table pParent.
If zKey is non-NULL, then this foreign key was declared to map to an explicit list of columns in table pParent.
If zMaster is a NULL pointer (occurs for a single database transaction),  this call is a no-op.
If zName is NULL, the upper layer is requesting a temp file.
If zName is specified, operate on only the one system call specified.

If zTable is NULL it means that the form of the name is Z and that columns from any table can be used.
If zTerm is not NULL, and this segment is not stored entirely on its root node, the range of leaves scanned can be reduced.
If zType contains more than one of the substrings, entries toward the top of  the table take priority.
If zWhere is NULL, delete the entire contents of the table.

In  that case we do not support atomic multi-file commits, so use the  simple case then too.
In (1), the term is not disabled.
In 4.1 we use CLIENT_SECURE_CONNECTION and thus the len of the buf should be passed
In 8 bit mode, this must always be TRUE.
In 8 bit, non-UTF mode, OP_CLASS and OP_NCLASS are the same.
In 8.13, the code was changed as below for ONCE, so that backups pass through the group and thereby reset captured values.
In ARM instruction words.
In ARM, we don't need to touch the arguments.

In SQLite version 3.5.0 and 3.5.1, it was possible to define the SQLITE_OMIT_MEMORY_ALLOCATION which would cause the built-in implementation of these routines to be omitted.
In SQLite, we never try to destroy a parser that was not successfully created in the first place.
In UTF-8 mode we can only do this properly if Unicode properties are supported.
In UTF-8 mode, STAR, MINSTAR, POSSTAR, QUERY, MINQUERY, POSQUERY, UPTO, MINUPTO, and POSUPTO and their caseless and negative versions may be followed by a multibyte character.
In UTF-8 mode, for characters greater than 127, we can only do the caseless thing when Unicode property support is available.
In UTF-8 mode, long characters have their length in c, with the UTF_LENGTH bit as a flag.
In UTF-8 mode, opcodes that are followed by a character may be followed by a multi-byte character.
In UTF-8 mode, the bits in a bit map correspond to character values, not to byte values.
In UTF-8 mode, we can only do a direct setting for bytes less than 128, as otherwise there can be confusion with bytes in the middle of UTF-8 characters.
In UTF8 mode, the result is in characters rather than bytes.
In Unicode, there are 8-bit characters that have alternate cases that are greater than 255 and vice-versa.
In Unix-like environments, if PCRE is installed in your standard system libraries, you should be able to compile this program using this command: gcc -Wall pcredemo.c -lpcre -o pcredemo If PCRE is not installed in a standard place, it is likely to be installed with support for the pkg-config mechanism.
In WAL mode, all cache-entries containing data modified within the current transaction are either expelled from the cache or reverted to their pre-transaction state by re-reading data from the database or WAL files.
In WRITER_LOCKED state, all locks  required to start a write-transaction are held, but no actual  modifications to the cache or database have taken place.
In Y format we must always have something in Y2, since it has no fnop, so this conveys that Y2 must always be used.
In a "traditional" environment, the tables will only recognize ASCII characters anyway, but in at least one Windows environment, some higher bytes bits were set in the tables.

In a similar way to cworkspace, it can be expanded using malloc() if necessary.
In a table record, all serial types are stored at the start of the record, and the blobs of data at the end.
In addition to its current configuration, have the Fts3MultiSegReader passed as the 4th argument also scan the doclist for term zTerm/nTerm.
In addition to the two coroutines (called selectA and selectB) there are 7 subroutines:  outA:    Move the output of the selectA coroutine into the output of the compound query.

In all other cases we loop through the available transtion times to find the correct entry
In all other cases, SQLITE_OK is returned.
In all other cases, tempcode will be pointing to the repeat opcode, and will be less than code, so the value of len will be greater than 0.
In all other cases, we have to make another call to match().
In an SQLite index record, the serial type is stored directly before the blob of data that it corresponds to.
In an UPDATE operation, if this index is the PRIMARY KEY index  of a WITHOUT ROWID table and there has been no change the primary key, then no collision is possible.

In doing so it also sets the BtShared.db member of each of the BtShared structures, ensuring that the correct busy-handler callback is invoked if required.
In dotfile locking, either a lock exists or it does not.
In each such row, the stat column will be a string consisting of a list of integers.
In earlier versions of PCRE, all the offsets were unset at the start of matching, but this doesn't work because atomic groups and assertions can cause a value to be set that should later be unset.
In earlier versions of the IJG code, this module quantized in YCbCr color space, processing the raw upsampled data without a color conversion step.
In earlier versions, the whole set of potential capturing offsets was set to -1 each time round the loop, but this is handled differently now.

In fact, there are only two possible starting bytes for characters in the range 128 - 255.
In fact, this can happen for a non-forward reference because another group with the same number might be created later.
In general it's also possible to do it for any CV variable as well, but it would require complex dataflow and/or type analysis.
In general, writeOnly is false if the transaction being rolled back modified the database schema.
In global scope, we know nothing
In lieu of that, let's use a define so we don't use absurd amounts of RAM for OSS users.
In many cases, method (1) above is the best approach.
In most cases IS_TMP_VAR operand may be used only once.
In most cases we only access a small range so it is faster to use a static buffer there BUT it offers also the possibility to have pointers read without the need to free them explicitley before returning.
In most cases, generating a warning message and inserting a fake EOI marker is the best course of action --- this will allow the decompressor to output however much of the image is there.
In most cases, the pointer argument passed with this file-control is NULL.
In most cases, this routine sets *pMode to 0, which will become an indication to robust_open() to create the file using SQLITE_DEFAULT_FILE_PERMISSIONS adjusted by the umask.

In multi-threaded environments, we have to init thread safely
In no event will the authors be held liable for any damages arising from the use of this software.
In no reference was obtained (because the pointer-map was used to obtain the value for *pPgnoNext), then ppPage is set to zero.
In non-RAC, we always get a brand new connection at the end of the loop and in RAC, we can get a good connection from a different instance before flushing out all bad ones.
In non-UTF-8 mode, the two bit maps are completely compatible.
In normal matching start_match will aways be greater than the first position at this stage, but a failed *SKIP can cause a return at the same point, which is why the first test exists.
In order for the operator to be optimizible, the RHS must be a string literal that does not begin with a wildcard.
In order for this mem3.iMaster replacement to work, the master chunk must be linked into the hash tables.
In order to  perform this abort without corrupting the database, we need to make sure that the statement is protected by a statement transaction.
In order to avoid an upsize followed by a downsize of the buffer, overestimate by the step size (which is 2K).
In order to avoid problems with upper layers, we need to report this file size as zero even though it is really 1.
In order to be able to rollback, an in-memory database must journal the page we are moving from.
In order to be consistent, we have to make sure we add the good amount of nulls depending on the current number of elements.

In that case you'll probably want to tweak the histogram sizes too.
In that case, also set YYMSG_ALLOC to the required number of bytes.
In that case, construct a new virtual term that is  pTerm converted into an IN operator.
In that case, delete the subtrees pLeft and pRight.
In that case, do not regenerate the code to manifest a view or the co-routine to implement a view.
In that case, don't check for expected tokens because there are none.
In that case, each connection has it own instance of this object.
In that case, it might take longer than normal for the lock to free.
In that case, just report a simple "syntax error".
In that case, only verify 4-byte alignment.
In that case, the calling routine should implement the IN operator using a sequence of Eq or Ne comparison operations.
In that case, the database should have never been written in the first place so it is OK to simply abandon the rollback.
In that case, the error code and message may or may not be set.
In that case, the free-list will be truncated to zero after this function returns, so it doesn't  matter if it still contains some garbage entries.
In that case, the sqlite3VdbeRecordCompare() may read up to two varints past the end of the allocated buffer before it realizes it is dealing with a corrupt record.
In that case, this routine generates code for the xfer optimization but also does a test to see if the destination table is empty and jumps over the xfer optimization code if the test fails.
In that case, this routine returns FALSE so that the caller will know to go ahead and generate an unoptimized transfer.
In that case, we allow yet more memory, just in case.
In that case, we do not really need shared memory.
In that case, we need to return right away and not make any changes to pExpr.
In that cases, the constants below can be ORed together.
In that way, if a database file is -rw-rw-rw or -rw-rw-r-, and a transaction crashes and leaves behind hot journals, then any process that is able to write to the database will also be able to recover the hot journals.
In the "trigHash" hash table (part of the sqlite3* that represents the  database).
In the 16-bit and 32-bit libraries, codepoints greater than 255 may be encountered even when UTF is not supported.
In the 8-bit library, this opcode is encountered only when UTF-8 mode mode is supported.
In the IEEE 754 standard, zero is signed.
In the absence of explicit truth probabilities, use heuristics to guess a reasonable truth probability.
In the absence of other comments, this synopsis becomes the comment on the opcode.
In the absence of sqlite_stat4 ANALYZE data, or if such data cannot be used, a single range inequality reduces the search space by a factor of 4.
In the actual code below, the value "16" is replaced with the  pre-processor macro FTS_MAX_APPENDABLE_HEIGHT.
In the actual compile, there is nothing to do.
In the amalgamation, the os_unix.c and os_win.c source files come before this source file.
In the case of YYABORT or YYACCEPT, an incorrect destructor might then be invoked immediately.
In the case of YYERROR or YYBACKUP, subsequent parser actions might lead to an incorrect destructor call or verbose syntax error message before the lookahead is translated.
In the case of a zero minimum, the first one was set up above.
In the case of reqchar, save the previous value for reinstating.
In the case someone doesn't read all the lines this will save time.
In the case where two connects were being made, without closing the first connect, access violations were occurring.
In the case where we had to get some local store to hold offsets for backreference processing, copy those that we can.
In the case where we have large paths, though, it gets a little tricker, and I like writing lockless data structures :P
In the caseful case, we can just compare the bytes, whether or not we are in UTF-8 mode.
In the colUsed field, the high-order bit (bit 63) is set if the table contains more than 63 columns and the 64-th or later column is used.
In the compile phase, check for empty string matching.
In the course of balancing the page and its siblings, cells may be inserted into or removed from the parent page (pParent).
In the current implementation the cache is traversed by a linear search from most-recent to least-recent.
In the current implementation, the rSetup value is either zero or the cost of building an automatic index (NlogN) and the NlogN is the same for compatible WhereLoops.
In the early years, the beginning of the year varied, sometimes based on the ascension of rulers.
In the event of a rollback, it may not be possible to restore the database to its original configuration.
In the event that an invalid digit is found, halt the conversion and return the portion which has been converted thus far.
In the first case, if the conflict-handling mode is REPLACE, then the conflicting row can be removed before proceeding.
In the first case, set *piEndBlock  to the integer value and *pnByte to zero before returning.
In the first pass over the image, we accumulate a histogram showing the usage count of each possible color.
In the former case a NULL pointer is returned the user and the latter is an internal programming error.
In the former case, we do not have to allocate any handles
In the future, we'll allow someone to register an error handler
In the latter case, *newlen will be 0.
In the latter case, a recursive call to match() is always required, unless the second alternative doesn't exist, in which case we can just plough on.
In the legacy version, the original SQL text is not saved in the prepared statement and so if a schema change occurs, SQLITE_SCHEMA is returned by sqlite3_step().
In the more common case where writable static data is supported, wsdHooks can refer directly to the "sqlite3Hooks" state vector declared above.
In the more common case where writable static data is supported, wsdPrng can refer directly to the "sqlite3Prng" state vector declared above.
In the more common case where writable static data is supported, wsdStat can refer directly to the "sqlite3Autoext" state vector declared above.
In the more common case where writable static data is supported, wsdStat can refer directly to the "sqlite3Stat" state vector declared above.
In the new version, the original SQL text is retained and the statement is automatically recompiled if an schema change occurs.
In the non-UCP case, or when UCP makes no difference, we build the bit map for the POSIX class in a chunk of local store because we may be adding and subtracting from it, and we don't want to subtract bits that may be in the main map already.
In the pathelogical case where no blanks are found, then the wrap occurs at the first blank.
In the places where this routine is used, it does not hurt to get an extra 2 - that just might result in some slightly slower code.
In the positive case, it can cause firstchar to be set.
In the pre-compile phase, accumulate the length of any extra data and reset the pointer.
In the pre-compile phase, do a syntax check, remember the longest name, and then remember the group in a vector, expanding it if necessary.
In the pre-compile phase, do a syntax check.
In the pre-compile phase, however, the code pointer can have that value after the start, because it gets reset as code is discarded during the pre-compile.
In the pre-compile phase, update the length by the length of the group, less the brackets at either end.
In the pre-compile phase, we can move the code pointer back to where it was for the start of the first branch.
In the pre-compile phase, we don't actually do the replication.
In the real compile phase, go back through the alternative branches and reverse the chain of offsets, with the field in the BRA item now becoming an offset to the first alternative.
In the real compile phase, just check the workspace used by the forward reference list.
In the real compile phase, there is some post-processing to be done.
In the real compile this will be picked up and the reference wrapped with OP_ONCE to make it atomic, so we must space in case this occurs.
In the real compile we do the work of looking for the actual reference.
In the real compile, search the name table.
In the second case, SQLITE_CONSTRAINT must be returned regardless of the conflict-handling mode specified by the user.
In the second case, we can use tail recursion to avoid using another stack frame, unless we have an an atomic group or an unlimited repeat of a group that can match an empty string.
In the second form this pragma sets the text encoding to be used in new database files created using this database handle.
In the second form, the primary key is (a,b,...)
In the second pass we must see if the name is duplicated.
In the second phase this is a sufficient test.
In the second,  set *piEndBlock to the first value and *pnByte to the second.
In the special case where we have not yet generated any xclass data, and this is the final item in the overall class, we need do nothing: later on, the opcode OP_NCLASS will be used to indicate that characters greater than 255 are acceptable.
In the statement  INSERT INTO t(a,b,c) ...
In the third form, we have to use an intermediate table to store the results of the select.
In the usual case where WSD is supported, the SQLITE_WSD and GLOBAL macros become no-ops and have zero performance impact.
In theory it would be Ok to update the cache of the header only at this point.
In theory we could just set events to D.
In theory we should allow an extra byte below, since we don't need the NULL.
In theory, it is only necessary to write the 28 bytes that the  journal header consumes to the journal file here.
In theory, it might be safe to do this without updating the wal-index header in shared memory, as all subsequent reader or writer clients should see that the entire log file has been checkpointed and behave accordingly.
In theory, the call to unixFileLock() cannot fail because another process is holding an incompatible lock.
In theory, this branch should never be hit, as this function should only be called after a locking-related function (i.e. fcntl()) has returned non-zero with the value of errno as the first argument.
In theory, you could get away with only having pipes and not using the linked lists at all.
In these cases the fk constraint counters might be set incorrectly if any OP_FkCounter related scans are  omitted.
In these cases the parameters are named as per the usual conventions.
In these cases we can just copy the pointer.
In these cases, instances of the following structure are used to store the file descriptor while waiting for an opportunity to either close or reuse it.
In these cases, therefore, an indirection via a local function is used.
In these circumstances pagerLockDb() and pagerUnlockDb() take a conservative approach - eLock is always updated when unlocking the file, and only updated when locking the file if the VFS call is successful.
In these routine, the letters are in reverse order.
In this branch is execute only when DIFF_ASSOC.
In this branch, the RHS of the IN might contain a NULL and the presence of a NULL on the RHS makes a difference in the outcome.

In this case either the BtShared mutex associated with the database the virtual table is stored in is held or, if the virtual table is stored in a non-sharable database, then the database handle mutex is held.
In this case exit early.
In this case foreign keys are parsed, but no other functionality is  provided (enforcement of FK constraints requires the triggers sub-system).
In this case free the pMerger argument before returning.
In this case if sqlite3BtreeEnter() were to be called, it might collide with some other operation on the database handle that owns *p, causing undefined behavior.
In this case ignore stat3 data.
In this case invalidate all incrblob cursors open on any row within the table with root-page pgnoRoot.
In this case invalidate only those incrblob cursors open on that specific row.
In this case it is likely enough that the redundant xSync() call will be changed to a no-op by the OS anyhow.
In this case it is necessary to add a term to the b-tree hierarchy that is (a) larger than the largest term  already written to the segment and (b) smaller than or equal to this term.
In this case it is not possible to determine the size of the segment, and so segment promotion does not take place.
In this case it returns 1.
In this case it sets the default encoding that will be used for the main database file if a new file is created.
In this case it should be freed along with the Parse object.

In this case just update the pager cache, not the database file.
In this case leave the iterator empty.

In this case stop reading  the journal file here.
In this case the  contents of the entire transaction are rolled back.
In this case the  correct response for the end-of-loop code (the OP_Return) is to  fall through to the next instruction, just as an OP_Next does if called on an uninitialized cursor.
In this case the Index.tnum variable is used to store the address of a VDBE instruction, not a database page number (it cannot - the database page is not allocated until the VDBE program is executed).
In this case the auto-vacuum applies as per normal.
In this case the buffer will be used to store the converted string to, and may be resized (made larger) if needed.

In this case the node-size is determined by inspecting the root node of the tree.
In this case the pcache already contains an initialized copy of the page.
In this case the position-list is not populated at all.

In this case the purpose of this call is to estimate the number of rows returned by the overall query.
In this case the return value of this  function should never be used.
In this case the returned value is  undefined.
In this case the row change  count is incremented by the number of rows in the table being cleared.
In this case the user is required to provide a rowid explicitly.
In this case the value is assumed to be an SQL NULL,  The expression is a bound variable, and this is a reprepare, or  The expression is a literal value.
In this case the value is assumed to be an SQL NULL,  The expression is a bound variable, and this is a reprepare, or  The sqlite3ValueFromExpr() function is able to extract a value  from the expression (i.e. the expression is a literal value).
In this case the values written to output parameters *pnLog and *pnCkpt are undefined.
In this case the whole cell needs to be parsed, a buffer allocated and accessPayload() used to retrieve the record into the buffer before VdbeRecordCompare() can be called.
In this case the xDelete, if any, is not invoked.
In this case there have been no changes to the database file, so the playback operation can be skipped.
In this case there is no "blocking connection", so invoking sqlite3_unlock_notify() results in the unlock-notify callback being invoked immediately.
In this case there is no need to make a copy of the data, just return a  pointer into the buffer to the caller.
In this case there is no way of knowing which of the pages that have been copied into the destination database are still  valid and which are not, so the entire process needs to be restarted.
In this case there is room on the trunk page to insert the page being freed as a new leaf.
In this case there may exist a Pager.pMap mapping that appears to be the right size but is not actually valid.
In this case there need not be overflow if certain parts of the pattern were not used, even though there are more capturing parentheses than vector slots.
In this case this function is a no-op.
In this case this function runs a blocking checkpoint.
In this case this line will also update Z_STRVAL_P(op2) to point to the new string.
In this case this routine will return a false-positive.
In this case this value is all that is required.
In this case vdbePmaReaderNext() is called on all child PmaReaders and the current PmaReader set to point to the first key in its range.
In this case we accept the default page size and delay actually opening the file until the first call to OsWrite().
In this case we are only interested in rows changed, not rows retrieved.
In this case we can mark the page as clean, since there will be no need to write it out to the database.
In this case we cannot use an incremental phrase.
In this case we ignore all text in the remainder of the path, name or value currently being parsed.
In this case we must scan the list of groups to which the name refers, and use the first one that is set.
In this case we simply fallback to interpreter.
In this case we would like to delete the journal file.
In this case zWhere is passed to sqlite3DbFree() before returning.
In this case,  because the index contains entries for both "first" and "1st", prefix queries such as 'fi*' or '1s*' will match correctly.
In this case, *pzErrmsg may also be set to point to an error message.
In this case, Expr.zSpan is typically the text of a column expression as it exists in a SELECT statement.
In this case, add zero token entries to the hash table and  return early.
In this case, all BtShared mutexes and the mutex associated with the database handle itself must be held.

In this case, do not set the no-content flag.
In this case, errno is set appropriately (by fcntl()).
In this case, even if SQLITE_ENABLE_STAT3/4 was defined  during compilation and the sqlite_stat3/4 table is present, no data is  read from it.
In this case, fts5 assumes that the final value of *ppOut  is undefined.
In this case, if isDirect is non-zero, then the database file is updated directly by writing an updated version of page 1 using a call to the  sqlite3OsWrite() function.
In this case, if the checksum of the wal-index-header following recovery is not the same as the checksum saved in the RbuState object, then the rbu handle is set to DONE state.
In this case, if the error code were simply returned to the user, the b-tree layer would not automatically attempt a rollback, as it assumes that an error in a read-only statement cannot leave the pager in an internally inconsistent  state.
In this case, instead of seeking within the b-tree as part of every OP_IdxInsert opcode, an OP_Last is added before the OP_IdxInsert to seek to the point within the b-tree where each key  should be inserted.
In this case, instead of sorting the records and writing the PMA to a temporary file itself, the calling thread usually launches a worker thread to do so.
In this case, instead of using a counter, an exception is thrown immediately if the INSERT violates a foreign key constraint.
In this case, it is guaranteed that the database page  pPg refers to will not be written to again within this transaction.
In this case, it is not considered.
In this case, jump to the next row.
In this case, keys are always delivered to the sorter in order of the primary key, which happens to be make up the final part  of the records being sorted.
In this case, no temporary files are required and subsequent calls to Rowkey(), Next() and Compare() read records  directly from main memory.
In this case, no work is done on iAbsLevel - fall through to the next iteration of the loop  to start work on some other level.
In this case, proceed.
In this case, set iDb to -1 here, to indicate that the VDBE should verify the integrity of all attached databases.
In this case, set the column type to NULL, even though it should really be "INTEGER".
In this case, the  In the above example, this means that the tokenizer returns the same token for inputs "first" and "1st".
In this case, the RHS is an index b-tree.
In this case, the RHS is the ROWID of table b-tree
In this case, the custom VFS must be explicitly created by the user before the RBU handle is opened.
In this case, the eventual  call to fts3InsertData() (either just below or further on in this function) will return SQLITE_MISMATCH.
In this case, the integrity of database iDb only is verified by the VDBE created below.
In this case, the map will fail and we have to sleep some time (until the child releases the mapping object) and retry.
In this case, the transaction has already been committed  (by deleting a master journal file) and the caller will ignore this  functions return code.
In this case, use an intkey B-Tree to store the set of IN(...) values instead of the usual (slower) variable length keys B-Tree.
In this case, we do what Perl does: advance the matching position by one character, and continue.
In this case, when tokenizing query text, the tokenizer may  provide multiple synonyms for a single term within the document.
In this circumstance, Perl ignores the SKIP entirely.
In this encoding mb-trail bytes doesn't mix with single bytes.
In this environment, fi and i, and fc and c, can be the same variables.
In this implementation, a single file can hold one or more separate  BTrees.
In this implementation, error checking is provided for testing and debugging purposes.
In this instance, that is ok because we want binary zero to be flagged as a meta-character, which in this sense is any character that terminates a run of data characters.
In this mode, write each query result to the key of the temporary table iParm.
In this module the prescan simply updates the histogram, which has been initialized to zeroes by start_pass.
In this say, all root pages are kept at the beginning of the database file, which is necessary for AUTOVACUUM to work right.
In this situation the  current sqlite3_prepare() operation will fail, but the following one will attempt to compile the supplied statement against whatever subset of the schema was loaded before the error occurred.
In this situation, the compressor will return to its caller (possibly with an indication that it has not accepted all the supplied scanlines).
In this situation, the decompressor will return to its caller (with an indication of the number of scanlines it has read, if any).
In this state the integer just read was a docid.
In this state the transaction may be committed simply by finalizing the journal file.
In this state we are expecting either a 1, indicating that the following integer will be a column number, or the start of a position list for column 0.
In this version of BtreeMoveto, pKey is a packed index record such as is generated by the OP_MakeRecord opcode.
In this version, it is assumed that each SegReader points to an entry in a doclist for identical terms.
In this way the topmost value on the stack is always belong to the current backtrack code path.
In this way, if rScore is the same for all SearchPoints, then iLevel becomes the deciding factor and the result is a depth-first search, which is the desired default behavior.
In this way, if the  higher level code is using pointer to the old allocation, it is  much more likely to break and we are much more liking to find the error.
In this way, if there is a race condition such that another thread has already populated the first page of the database, no damage is done.
In this way, terms get disabled if derived virtual terms are tested first.
In this way, the first chunk has an index of 1.
In this way, the initialization of the sqlite3_context object occurs only once, rather than once for each evaluation of the function.
In this way, the initialization of the sqlite3_context only happens once, instead of on each call to the step function.
In those cases,  the bitmap becomes dense with high cardinality.
In those cases, the following call to btreeInitPage() will likely return SQLITE_CORRUPT.
In threaded environments, we have to mutex lock to do this init, but we don't want to use a mutex every time to check that it was Inited.
In which case the bIncr flag is set.
In xShmLock(), one can go from unlocked to shared and back or from unlocked to exclusive and back.

Instead delete and recreate.
Instead it creates "imposter" tables using the SQLITE_TESTCTRL_IMPOSTER interface that it uses to update each b-tree individually.
Instead modify the script and run it to regenerate this code.
Instead of a lock on the table/index rooted at page iRoot, the caller may hold a write-lock on the schema table (root page 1).
Instead of a true 3-D array, we use a row of pointers to 2-D arrays.
Instead of doing that, set the cursor state to "invalid".
Instead of reading the value out of the header, it instead loads the "DataVersion" from the pager.
Instead of resolving full real path name each time we need to identify file, we create a key that consist from requested file name, current working directory, current include_path, etc

Instead of trying to locate the .exe file it'll just return a handle to the process image.

Instead the frame and page numbers that would be read and written are recorded.
Instead they are used to allocate space for VdbeCursor/BtCursor structures.
Instead we map the range directly.
Instead, a process that requests an EXCLUSIVE lock may actually obtain a PENDING lock.
Instead, a special call of pcre_exec() * is made with the PCRE_NOTEMPTY_ATSTART and PCRE_ANCHORED flags set.
Instead, create a synthetic root node that contains nothing but a  pointer to the single content node.
Instead, forget about the specific key values and just allocate and initialize per-thread storage until we find a key that writes to the memory location we want.
Instead, if an error occurs, true is returned (indicating that  data is available) and the error code returned when xColumn or some other method is next invoked on the save virtual table cursor.
Instead, invoke the unlock-notify callback with the context array already accumulated.
Instead, it assumes a hot-journal exists and obtains an EXCLUSIVE lock on the database file before attempting to roll it back.
Instead, it is linked into the Vdbe.pDelFrame list.
Instead, it should be called via macro osGetpagesize().
Instead, it stores the same values (A, B and C above) in a register array and makes a single invocation of VUpdate.
Instead, it tests that the same set of pgno/rowid combinations are  visited regardless of whether the doclist-index identified by parameters iSegid/iLeaf is iterated in forwards or reverse order.
Instead, just count through the strings.
Instead, just supply small dummy tables.
Instead, mark the stream as OK to auto-clean
Instead, pager_unlock() is called.
Instead, set output variables *paRoot and *pnRoot to contain the root node.
Instead, simply invoke the syntax error routine and continue going as if nothing had happened.
Instead, sort the VdbeSorter.pRecord list.
Instead, store a boolean result (either 0, or 1, or NULL) in register P2.
Instead, the canonical data storage is a covering index btree.
Instead, the divider  cell consists of the integer key for the right-most cell of  the sibling-page assembled above only.
Instead, the entire table should be passed to sqlite3_free_table() when the calling procedure is finished using it.
Instead, the error code is returned to the caller.
Instead, the integer values is written into u.iValue and the EP_IntValue flag is set.
Instead, the number is converted to a string and back again using strtod().
Instead, the term is inserted into the parent of pTree.
Instead, they are moved from the Table.pVTable list to another linked list headed by the sqlite3.pDisconnect member of the corresponding sqlite3 structure.
Instead, this function serves only to release outstanding resources.
Instead, upgrade the priority of the highest priority existing sample that shares this prefix.
Instead, we catch it when the OP_END is reached.
Instead, we compute with fewer bits and propagate the carry if necessary when rounding the final digit up.
Instead, we simply count through to the one we want - this isn't a performance issue because these strings are used only when there is a compilation error.

Interior nodes are written using InteriorWriter, and read using InteriorReader.
Interior nodes only store enough term data to distinguish adjacent children (if the rightmost term of the left child is "something", and the leftmost term of the right child is "wicked", only "w" is stored).
InteriorWriters are created as needed when SegmentWriter creates new leaf nodes, or when an interior node itself grows too big and must be split.

Isolated 10xx xxxx byte
Issue an error message if it does.
It  cannot be dropped as there are currently active SQL statements.
It  invokes callbacks registered with sqlite3_wal_hook() as required.
It  is not considered an error if the iterator reaches EOF.
It  is therefore not possible for an in-memory pager to enter the ERROR  state.
It  just sets the internal state of the pager object so that the  truncation will be done when the current transaction is committed.
It *seems* better than clearing the msb.
It *target is NULL then we allocate a large enough buffer, store the converted string into it, and make target point to it.
It adds entries for each term in the new record to the pendingTerms hash table.
It ain't gonna proceed to real execution anyway, but the correct descriptor is needed already.
It also assumes that if two files are created in the same file-system directory (i.e. a database and its journal file) that the sector size will be the same for both.
It also assumes that the path is not empty
It also contains code to merge FTS3 b-tree segments.
It also contains definitions of "finder" functions.
It also contains part of the implementation of the SQLITE_CONFIG_PAGECACHE and sqlite3_release_memory() features.
It also decrements the VTable ref count.
It also helps build the error message
It also may not - the GROUP BY might use a database index that causes rows to be grouped together as required but not actually sorted.
It also sets Mem.flags to MEM_Null.
It also sets a flag in local variable "flags" to indicate the memory management (one of MEM_Dyn or MEM_Static).
It also simplifies the handling of Z_ADDREF_P because we don't need to check if only either NUM or ASSOC is set but not both.
It also specified that there would be exactly 12 months per year and 365.25 days per year with every 4th year being a leap year.
It always returns SQLITE_OK.
It appears that Perl allows any characters whatsoever, other than a closing parenthesis, to appear in arguments, so we no longer insist on letters, digits, and underscores.

It can be acquired only when it is zero.
It can be omitted and everything will still work.
It can be used to clean up  any outstanding resources before process shutdown, if required.

It closes the directory and file handles, if they are valid, and sets all fields of the unixFile structure to 0.
It comes from  http://ftp.s390.ibm.com/products/oe/bpxqp9.html  and maps the characters of EBCDIC code page 1047 (the code used for Unix-derived software on IBM's 390 systems) to the corresponding characters from ISO 8859-1.
It considerably speeds things up to do a normal load before trying using an atomic operation.
It consists of three parts.

It contains service information about all pages.
It converts the expression given in its argument from a TK_STRING into a TK_ID if the expression is just a TK_STRING with an optional COLLATE clause.
It costs 256 bytes, but it is a lot faster than doing character value tests (at least in some simple cases I timed), and in some applications one wants PCRE to compile efficiently as well as match efficiently.

It does *not* invoke the busy handler when upgrading from SHARED to RESERVED, or when upgrading from SHARED to EXCLUSIVE (which occurs during hot-journal rollback).
It does not add  extra data to the FTS index or require FTS5 to query for multiple terms, so it is efficient in terms of disk space and query speed.
It does not change over-length encodings to 0xfffd as some systems recommend.
It does not check that the expression does not exceed the  maximum allowable depth.
It does not contribute to  FTS functionality, or even the integrity-check, in any way.
It does not do expression rebalancing.
It does not explicitly say so, but this implies that it overrides locks set by the same process using a different file descriptor.

It ensures that the result currently stored in *pRes is the correct result of comparing the current positions of the two iterators.
It exists solely for verifying the correct operation of the SQLite library.

It is complete
It is considered impossible for an index to use more than 1024 levels.
It is convenient to use a  vdbe memory cell to manage the memory allocation required for a VdbeCursor structure for the following reasons:  Sometimes cursor numbers are used for a couple of different purposes in a vdbe program.
It is critical that the child page be defragmented before being copied into the parent, because if the parent is page 1 then it will by smaller than the child due to the database header, and so all the free space needs to be up front.
It is documented that this happens.
It is done like this so that those without OP_RECURSE that are not fixed length get a diagnosic with a useful offset.
It is done this way to save having to use another function argument, which would take up space on the stack.

It is implemented by the pluggable module.
It is important that it is created as an auto-vacuum capable db.
It is important that we make both calls to BF_crypt() from the same scope such that they likely use the same stack locations, which makes the second call overwrite the first call's sensitive data on the stack and makes it more likely that any alignment related issues would be detected by the self-test.
It is important to check for IMAGE_FILETYPE_TIFF JPEG does not use absolute pointers instead its pointers are relative to the start of the TIFF header in APP1 section.
It is important to run this code, but we don't want to run it too often and soak up CPU cycles for no reason.

It is not necessary to lock the  wal-index to do this as the SQLITE_SHM_WRITE lock held on the wal-index guarantees that there are no other writers, and no data that may be in use by existing readers is being overwritten.
It is not part of the bug aftermath, though, and is difficult and possibly unreasonable to avoid given the use of C strings by the caller, which results in similar timing leaks anyway.)  For actual implementation, we set an array index in the variable "bug" (0 means no bug, 1 means sign extension bug emulation) and a flag in the variable "safety" (bit 16 is set when the safety measure is requested).

It is possible for the schema to change multiple times and for the cookie to be set back to prior value.
It is possible that a buffered stream was switched to non-buffered, so we drain the remainder of the buffer before using the "raw" read mode for the excess
It is possible that calling this routine itself caused a stack overflow.
It is possible that external processes may have truncated the database file and then extended it back to its original size while this process was not holding a lock.

It may be that this trigger has already been coded (or is in the process of being coded).
It may be used by applications for any purpose.
It may fail, the destruction code must handle this case
It may happen that we are not quite the first function to try to allocate thread-local storage keys, so instead of depending on getting 0x100, we try for 0x108, allocating keys until we get the one we want and then freeing the ones we didn't want.

It might be the case that multiple tables are indexable.
It might have been more accurate to call this "considered textual on the local system" than "ASCII."  It considered a file to be "International language text" if each of its characters was either an ASCII printing character (according to the real ASCII standard, not the above test), a character in the range 0x80 ...
It might just as well be a procedure (returning void) but we continue to return an integer result code for historical reasons.

It returns the total number of pages in the database.
It returns true if such a lock exists and false otherwise.
It returns true if the rows really will be sorted in the specified order, or false otherwise.
It returns true if the two strings are equal, otherwise false.
It searches up the characters, looking for ranges of characters in the "other" case.
It seeks the b-tree cursor associated with blob handle p to point to row iRow.
It seems that early versions of GCC stored the two words of a 64-bit float in the wrong order.
It seems that the appearance of a nested POSIX class supersedes an apparent external class.
It seems to be the only way to do such a check at compile time, as the sizeof() operator does not work in the C preprocessor.
It serves two purposes at once:  1.
It sets up either VdbeSorter.pMerger (for single threaded sorters) or pReader (for multi-threaded sorters) so that it can be used to iterate through all records stored in the sorter.
It sets variable pg1 to the identifier of the first page of the sector pPg is located on.
It should be called prior to execute().
It should be deleted using sqlite3Fts3ExprFree() in this case.
It should be freed  when the expression node is.
It should be noted that all mutexes require initialization on the Win32 platform.
It should be passed a pseudo-random value (i.e.  one obtained from sqlite3_randomness()).
It should be passed some bitwise combination of the PAGER_* flags.
It should be possible to remove this when we no longer care about versions of clang before 3.8.
It should be updated if more commands are added to this function.
It should be used in all cases, but for consistency with earlier versions of dtoa, it is optional when MULTIPLE_THREADS is not defined.
It should never occur otherwise, but just in case it does, have something ready to print.
It should raise error, when there is 3rd parameter
It shouldn't be possible for fullfsync to fail on the local  file system (on OSX), so failure indicates that FULLFSYNC isn't supported for this file system.
It simplifies code elsewhere.
It skips over things that do not influence this.
It still happens even though I set it to null, so something weird is going on.
It still makes no sense to do it as Windows addresses are virtual per se and can or should be randomized anyway through Address Space Layout Radomization (ASLR).
It still points to the same term though - just a different rowid.
It stores all the requested values in ZCG(include_paths) shared hash table, current value in ZCG(include_path)/ZCG(include_path_len) and one letter "path key" in ZCG(include_path_key).
It stores information about collisions (everything which contains a zend_reference * may be referenced by multiple watches)  Creating a watchpoint: Create watchpoints with PHPDBG_WATCH_IMPLICIT set on each zval and HashTable in hierarchy except the last zval or HashTable fetch.
It takes a bit more work in UTF-8 mode.
It tests if there is a hot journal present in the file-system for the given pager.
It tests the value of length for (2 + 2*LINK_SIZE) in the pre-compile phase to find out whether anything has yet been compiled or not.
It then calls the output subroutine and resets the aggregate accumulator registers in preparation for the next GROUP BY batch.
It then calls this function to actually insert the  data into the intkey B-Tree.
It then dequotes any of the strings that appear to be quoted.
It then returns the sqlite3_io_methods object that implements that strategy.
It turns out that on some non-Unix-like systems there are problems with programs that use a lot of stack.
It turns out this is useful for other purposes, such as parsing config files.
It updates the phrases current position list to include only those positions that are really instances of the phrase (after considering deferred tokens).
It updates the virtual stack, or creates it if this is the first method entry in the thread.
It used to be required that a statement transaction was not active, but this restriction has been removed (CREATE INDEX needs to move a page when a statement transaction is active).
It used to be the case that setting this value to zero would turn the limit off.
It used to be used to recover from a malloc() failure, but SQLite now does this automatically.
It used to set an alarm callback that was invoked when memory usage grew too large.
It uses only the public interface defined here.
It uses the RDTSC opcode to read the cycle count value out of the processor and returns that value.
It uses the output of the operations by C99 as the reference to check the implementation of complex numbers in Go.
It was coded primarily to act as a go-between for expat and xmlrpc.
It was designed with consideration of the flaws in various other generators.
It was determined by inspection of the character codes stored in Microsoft font symbol.
It was found so go ahead and provide it
It was not always the first of January.
It will be automatically closed  when the last lock is cleared.
It will be automatically closed when the last lock is cleared.
It will be moved back after the names have been resolved.
It will be released when sqlite3DeleteIndex() is called.
It will be replaced by the real entry in code generated at sqlite3EndTable().
It will be used as an internal node of the new tree.
It will not be NULL except PS_OPEN_FUNC().
It will round at 255 as this is unsigned char.
It will then try to allocate the new page and will only fail to allocate a new page on an OOM error.
It will verify, amongst other things, that it matches the checksum generated by inspecting the index itself.
It works for objects as small as two bytes.
It works in a similar way to sqlite3_value_text(), except the data returned is in the encoding specified by the second parameter, which must be one of SQLITE_UTF16BE, SQLITE_UTF16LE or SQLITE_UTF8.
It works like ExprSetProperty() during VVA processes but is a no-op for delivery.
It would be better, IMHO, to skip the C from the S part of the encoding.
It would be done in rshutdown anyway but the handler will have had it's dtor called by then.
It would be more consistent to return "c:." but that would require making the string *longer*.
It would be nice to find a better solution to this problem in the future.
It would be simpler to detect this as part of the loop below, but we do the detection here in order to avoid populating the pager cache with two separate objects associated with the same page number.
It would not be unreasonable to make this value much larger.
It'd be better to detect fullfsync support once and avoid  the fcntl call every time sync is called.
It's a bit baroque to remove a signal stack here only to add one in minit, but it's a simple change that keeps DragonFly working like other OS's.
It's a bit baroque to remove a signal stack here only to add one in minit, but it's a simple change that keeps NetBSD working like other OS's.
It's a block algorithm
It's a hashtable that contains all the dependencies between Hack objects.
It's also only valid for Great Brittain and it's colonies.
It's an overflow on 32 bit, however it won't fix as long as zend_long is 32 bit.
It's available, so we can call it.
It's better to raise error for this, but disabled error for better compatibility
It's better to use additional FREE opcode and simplify the FETCH handlers their selves
It's defined in a macro so that the definition is next to the definition of the opcodes in pcre_internal.h.
It's done like this so that the start of the bracket has a zero offset until it is closed, making it possible to detect recursion.
It's easier to write this out separately than try to macrify it.
It's length from the segment is the shorter of the lengths from the endpoints, but call the distance -1, so as not to compute the alpha nor draw the pixel.
It's not a block algorithm
It's not really clear how to get out of this state.
It's not really the closest* molad that we want here.
It's odd to simulate an io-error here, but really this is just using the io-error infrastructure to test that SQLite handles this function failing.
It's okay to return an empty array if no filters are registered
It's pointless to match character encodings here.
It's possible to override this general case in the activate() callback, if necessary.
It's probably "Too many connections, which has SQL state 08004".
It's purpose it to accumulate statistical data and/or samples in the Stat4Accum object about the index being analyzed.
It's safe to reread without freeing
It's supposed to return an array of property names to be serialized.
It's supposed to throw an exception on stack overflow, but we don't actually handle that exception, so what happens in practice is we terminate at toplevel with an unhandled exception and a useless ocaml backtrace.
It's the md argument of match(), which never changes.
It's too flawed to consider.
It's unclear if XHTML 1.0 allows C1 characters.
It's unsigned.
It's very rare and useless case.

Its advantage is that it is guaranteed to return a color index in one search over the color table.
Its content needs to  be initialized.
Its contents are now stored either on real database pages or within the  new pSpace buffer, so it may be safely freed here.
Its contents will be re-inserted later on.
Its job is to fill in the TabResult structure appropriately, allocating new memory as necessary.
Its length field points back to the previous branch while the bracket remains open.
Its purpose is to set the object pointer for the object when you can't possibly know its value until you have parsed the arguments from the constructor function.
Its purpose is to unify error messages and automatically generate clickable html error messages if correcponding ini setting (html_errors) is activated.
Its used by just about every call to ts_resource_ex().

Late addition:  construct the table according to file size for noticeable speed improvement on small files.
Later REGISTER_INI_ENTRIES() is called which triggers the actual registering of ini entries and uses zend_get_configuration_directive() to fetch the previously stored name/value pair from configuration hash table and registers the static ini entries which match the name to the value into EG(ini_directives) hash table.
Later accel_getcwd() can use stored value and avoid getcwd() call.
Later code assumes the PRIMARY KEY contains no repeated columns.
Later, the calling routine should invoke sqlite3WhereEnd() with the return value of this function in order to complete the WHERE clause processing.

Later, when we remove the Bcc: out of the header we know it was the last thing.
Later: if a malloc() or IO error occurs during a Movepage() call, then the page may not be in the cache either.

Like FULL but wait for for readers
Like RESTART but also truncate WAL
Like SRT_Fifo, but unique results only
Like SRT_Queue, but unique results only
Like YYERROR except do call yyerror.
Like all other character and string literals that are compared against the regular expression pattern, we must use STR_ macros instead of literal strings to make sure that UTF-8 support works on EBCDIC platforms.
Like free() but works for allocations obtained from sqlite3MemMalloc() or sqlite3MemRealloc().
Like malloc(), but remember the size of the allocation so that we can find it later using sqlite3MemSize().
Like mgt0 above except we are looking for a value of m which is exactly 1
Like optimization range constraints always occur in pairs
Like perl we only support string increment
Like realloc().
Like sqlite3ExprIfFalse() except that a copy is made of pExpr before code generation, and that copy is deleted after code generation.
Like the other angle in libGD, in which increasing y moves downward, this is a counterclockwise rotation.
Like this:  "database.table".
Like this:  goto Init coA: coroutine for left query (A) coB: coroutine for right query (B) outA: output one row of A outB: output one row of B (UNION and UNION ALL only) EofA: ...
Likewise, registering a callback using sqlite3_wal_hook() disables the automatic checkpoint mechanism configured by this function.

Limit the error using transfer function set by init_error_limit.
Limit the length of the LIKE or GLOB pattern to avoid problems of deep recursion and N*N behavior in patternCompare().

Luckily, in 5.0 an error always aborts execution of a statement, wherever it is a multi-statement or a stored procedure, so it should be safe to unconditionally turn off the flag here.
Luckily, the value of CHAR_VT is 0x0b in both ASCII and EBCDIC, so we could just adjust the appropriate bit.

M - Any values pushed by the current alternative.
M is an integer, 2 or 3, that indices how many different ways the branch can go.
MAP_ANON is deprecated, but not in macosx
MAP_FIXED leads to discarding of the old mapping, so it can't be used.
MAP_NORESERVE is because we want a lot more virtual memory than what we are actually going to use.
MARK, and PRUNE/SKIP/THEN with an argument must skip over the argument string.
MATCH 'a OR (b NEAR c)'  is matched against a row containing:  'a b d e'  then any snippet() should ony highlight the "a" term, not the "b" (as "b" is part of a non-matching NEAR clause).

My intuition is that this might extend through 2x or 4x the pagesize.
My normal style of coding would have declared them within each of those blocks.

NORMAL    The journal is synced once before writes begin on the database.
NORMAL means that the WAL is synced prior to the start of checkpoint and that the database file is synced at the conclusion of the checkpoint if the entire content of the WAL was written back into the database.
NOT NULL, CHECK, and UNIQUE constraints are all checked.
NOT REACHED
NOT flag for header lines fetch
NOT* safe for binary strings
NOTE that the real ob_gzhandler is an alias to "zlib output compression".
NOTE we don't use _UNICODE
NOTE(jsing, minux): we can't free oldtcb without causing double-free problem.
NOTE:  These values must match the corresponding PAGER_ values in pager.h.
NOTE: - Save handlers _MUST_NOT_ change/refer PS() values.
NOTE: Default php_session_create_id() does not check collision.
NOTE: Each cache entry config_hash contains the combination from all user ini files found in the path starting from doc_root throught to dirname(PATH_TRANSLATED).
NOTE: Evaluation of the c argument should not have any side-effects
NOTE: On some sub-platforms, the InterlockedCompareExchange "function" is really just a macro that uses a compiler intrinsic (e.g. x64).
NOTE: Return type is signed so we can return -1 on error.
NOTE: Signed due to -1 on error.
NOTE: The WinRT sub-platform is always assumed to be based on the NT kernel.
NOTE: The naming of these userland functions was quite unlucky
NOTE: These values must match the corresponding BTREE_ values in btree.h.
NOTE: Updating access timestamp at PS_READ_FUNC() may extend life of obsolete session data.
NOTE: We are dealing with a relative path name and the data directory has been set.
NOTE: Windows CE is handled differently here due its lack of the Win32 API LockFile.
NOTE: Windows CE is handled differently here due its lack of the Win32 API LockFileEx.
NOTE: Windows CE is handled differently here due its lack of the Win32 API UnlockFile.
NOTE: can't guarantee that output or input/output parameters are set until this fella returns SQL_NO_DATA, according to MSDN ODBC docs
NOTE: data must be zero terminated
NOTE: forward declare this rather than including crt_externs.h as not all SDKs provide it
NOTE: modifying 'collator_XX_args' do not forget to modify approptiate 'collator_XX_args' for the procedural API.
NOTE: pad_char may be set to '0' because of the 0 flag.
NOTE: preprocess away the availability information to allow use of unsupported APIs on certain targets (i.e. tvOS)
NOTE: the intermediate variable "temp" is used in this code because at least one compiler gives a warning about loss of "const" attribute if the cast (pcre_uchar *)codestart is used directly in the function call.
NOTE: the number of data units matched may differ, because in UTF-8 there are some characters whose upper and lower case versions code have different numbers of bytes.
NOTE: the purposes are added as integer keys - the keys match up to the X509_PURPOSE_SSL_XXX defines in x509v3.h
NOTE: tidy does not support iterative/cumulative parsing, so chunk-sized output handler is not possible
NOTES Be careful to rewind any vector passed in to you if you expect to iterate through the entire list.

Nevertheless, a dotlock is an appropriate locking mode for use if no other locking strategy is available.
Nevertheless, be sure  to test the case where a malloc error occurs while trying to set  a bit in a bit vector.
Nevertheless, it is formally deprecated in Bison 2.4.2's NEWS entry, where a plan to phase it out is discussed.
Nevertheless, some published applications that were originally written for version 3.6.23 or earlier do in fact depend on SQLITE_MISUSE  returns, and those were broken by the automatic-reset change.
Nevertheless, some regular expressions can cause it to recurse to a great depth.
Nevertheless, there is a built-in protection when sending a command packet, that checks if the line is clear - useful for debug purposes and to be switched off in release builds.
Nevertheless, we include a NEVER() test for the error state as a safeguard against future changes.

Normally the execute_data is allocated on the VM stack (because it does not actually do any allocation and thus is faster).
Normally this is set when '(' is read
Normally turned off
Normally turned off.
Normally we don't worry about that warning, but some users do, and we want to make it easy for users to remove YYFAIL uses, which will produce warnings from Bison 2.5.
Normally you would call zval_copy_ctor( pz_ch ), or SEPARATE_ZVAL, but those create new zvals, which is already being done in add_assoc_resource
Normally, a PmaReader object iterates through an existing PMA stored  within a temp file.
Normally, a connection open in exclusive mode is never in PAGER_OPEN state.
Normally, iSavepoint is greater than or equal to zero.
Normally, if a back reference hasn't been set, the length that is passed is negative, so the match always fails.
Normally, if a transaction is rolled back, any backup processes are updated as data is copied out of the rollback journal and into the database.
Normally, if an error occurs while the pager layer is attempting to  finalize the underlying journal file, this function returns an error and the upper layer will attempt a rollback.

Not available on windows, the query is possible but there is no DNS_HINFO_DATA structure
Not because vxworks would not benefit from the change (it might, we're not sure), but because no way to test it is currently available.
Not clear that being smart is worth any trouble anyway --- large skips are infrequent.

Not sure I can fix this.
Not sure if this is correct (never seen float used in Exif format)
Not sure if this was an implementation artifact or an intentional decision when fts3 was first implemented.
Not sure what should be done here if it's a static method
Not sure which smartass came up with this idea in the first though :)
Not sure why it's a needed but it marks that the whole stream will include many result sets.
Not sure why the memset is necessary here, but without it, we get a bogus stack size out of pthread_attr_getstacksize.
Not that TRUE is returned even if xCond() fails and no substitution occurs.
Not the best thing, but in practice it should be good-enough
Not the root node
Not too pretty, but it works.
Not used on win32
Not used yet
Not yet implemented in the engine
Not yet implemented.
Note 1: If the FK is declared "ON UPDATE CASCADE", then the may-abort flag will eventually be set on this statement anyway (when this function is called as part of processing the UPDATE within the action trigger).
Note 2:  C is only used for STAT3 and STAT4.
Note 2: At first glance it may seem like SQLite could simply omit all OP_FkCounter related scans when either CASCADE or SET NULL applies.
Note also that it does not work to make an EXPRDUP_REDUCE copy of a reduced expression.
Note also that the numeric types are grouped together so that testing for a numeric type is a single comparison.
Note also that when the IN operator appears in the WHERE clause, it might result in additional nested loops for scanning through all values on the right-hand side of the IN.
Note in particular that this includes atomic brackets OP_ONCE and OP_ONCE_NC because the number of characters matched by .* cannot be adjusted inside them.
Note in particular that we must go ahead and allocate the record number for the table entry now.
Note in particular the content of freelist leaf pages can be changed arbitrarily without affecting the logical equivalence of the database.
Note is a letter is a 'break' in the word
Note negative special
Note slight error in 16-bit case:  up to 256 16-bit shades may get mapped to a single 8-bit shade, and only one of them is supposed to be transparent.
Note that "equivalent" doesn't necessarily mean "identical", e.g., two alpha-converted types are "equivalent" though not literally byte- identical.
Note that Adar II is assigned the month number 7 and Elul is always 13.
Note that I.1 and D.1 are very similar operations, as are I.2 and D.2.
Note that ICU uses int32_t as string length and PHP uses size_t.
Note that LONGLONG is a 64-bit value
Note that MutexAlloc() is called for a static mutex prior to initializing the malloc subsystem - this implies that the allocation of a static mutex must not require support from the malloc subsystem.
Note that ON cannot be a database, table or column name, so there is no need to worry about syntax like  "CREATE TRIGGER ...
Note that OP_DIGIT etc.
Note that OleView is unable to generate C headers for this particular tlb...
Note that POS_END and POS_COLUMN occur  in the same logical place as the position element, and act as sentinals ending a position list array.
Note that RowKey and RowData are really exactly the same instruction
Note that Windows does not allow a file to be deleted if some other process has it open.
Note that a "regular journal-handle" may be a wrapper capable of caching the first portion of the journal file in memory to implement the atomic-write optimization (see  source file journal.c).
Note that a return of SQLITE_OK does not guarantee that the page is well-formed.
Note that assign_pipes may have re-ordered the instrs (by inserting no-ops in lower slots) so we need to reset them.
Note that at this point we can encounter only the "basic" bracket opcodes such as BRA and CBRA, as this is the place where they get converted into the more special varieties such as BRAPOS and SBRA.
Note that both FLT_ROUNDS and fegetround() are specified by the C99 standard (and are specified to be consistent, with fesetround() affecting the value of FLT_ROUNDS), but that some (Linux) systems do not work correctly in this regard, so using fegetround() is more portable than using FLT_ROUNDS directly.
Note that entity tables are defined in terms of unicode code points
Note that entries are added in order of increasing K.
Note that even though the freeblock list was checked by btreeInitPage(), that routine will not detect overlap between cells or freeblocks.
Note that exprAnalyze() might add new virtual terms onto the end of the WHERE clause.
Note that files save handler supports splitting session data into multiple directories.
Note that first_significant_code() skips over backward and negative forward assertions when its final argument is TRUE.
Note that if an error occurred, it might be the case that no VDBE code was generated.
Note that if any index could potentially invoke a REPLACE conflict resolution  action, then we need to open all indices because we might need to be deleting some records.
Note that if one of the dynamic mutex parameters (SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST or SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE) is used then sqlite3_mutex_alloc() returns a different mutex on every call.
Note that if there is an INTEGER PRIMARY KEY into which a NULL is being inserted, that NULL will be translated into a unique ID for the row.
Note that if you present a bogus address (one not in any segment), you will get a different number back, formed from subtracting the address of the first block.
Note that in UTF-8 mode, '.' matches a character of any length, but for the other character types, the valid characters are all one-byte long.
Note that in caseless UTF-8 mode, the number of subject bytes matched may be different to the number of reference bytes.
Note that in that book's description of DES the lookups for the initial, pbox, and final permutations are inverted (this has been brought to the attention of the author).
Note that it is illegal for the driver to take a reference to param, as it resides in transient storage only at this time.
Note that it is not safe to retry close() after EINTR since the file descriptor might have already been reused by another thread.
Note that it is possible for the library compile-time options to override this setting
Note that on 80x86 machines, the pointer row is in near memory but the actual arrays are in far memory (same arrangement as we use for image arrays).
Note that on Linux (at least) there is a race condition here because semaphore undo on process exit is not atomic, so we could acquire SYSVSEM_SETVAL before a crashed process has decremented SYSVSEM_USAGE in which case count will be greater than it should be and we won't set max_acquire.
Note that on Win32 CWD is per drive (heritage from CP/M).
Note that only run-time accessed data need to be cleaned up, pre-defined data can not contain objects and thus are not probelmatic
Note that only the pointer (the 2nd parameter) matters.
Note that pCsr must be open on a INTKEY table and saveCursorPosition() and hence saveAllCursors() cannot fail on a BTREE_INTKEY table, hence saveAllCursors can only return SQLITE_OK.
Note that phpdbg_help_text is not assumed to be collated in key order.
Note that processing for WHERE_GROUPBY and WHERE_DISTINCTBY is not as strict.
Note that setting READ_UNCOMMITTED overrides most lock detection, but it does *not* override schema lock detection, so this all still works even if READ_UNCOMMITTED is set.
Note that some of the more obscure formatting options from recent C-library standards are omitted from this implementation.
Note that the "rd" argument of RMATCH isn't actually used in this definition.
Note that the "rw" argument of RMATCH isn't actually used in this definition.
Note that the SQLITE_TEXT constant was also used in SQLite version 2 for a completely different meaning.
Note that the Unicode property types will be present only when SUPPORT_UCP is defined, but we don't wrap the little bits of code here because it just makes it horribly messy.
Note that the _LENGTH and _TYPEOF values must correspond to OPFLAG_LENGTHARG and OPFLAG_TYPEOFARG.
Note that the affinity conversions are stored back into the input registers P1 and P3.
Note that the call to sqlite3ResultSetOfSelect() will expand any "*" elements in the results set of the view and will assign cursors to the elements of the FROM clause.
Note that the current accepted value for the tropical year is 365.242199 days, not 365.25.
Note that the expression in the result set should have already been resolved by the time the WHERE clause is resolved.
Note that the first 5 fields of this structure are identical to sqlite3_rtree_geometry.
Note that the generated buffer will not contain a methodCall.
Note that the integer representation is always preferred, even if the affinity is REAL, because an integer representation is more space efficient on disk.
Note that the loop starting at 1 is intentional, since we've already done the first round of the algorithm.
Note that the mapping is not necessarily ordered.
Note that the number is in the usual order, not reversed as with integer conversions.
Note that the order of the first four values is in order of precedence when parsing expressions.
Note that the pager will not actually attempt to load or journal  content for any page that really does lie past the end of the database file on disk.
Note that the relationship between SHAREd and EXCLUSIVE locks is a little different here than in posix.
Note that the repeated item starts at tempcode, not at previous, which might be the first part of a string whose (former) last char we repeated.
Note that the second parameter, headers_lc, is actually a lowercased version of headers.
Note that the sqlite3_vfs.pNext field of the VFS object is modified by the SQLite core when the VFS is registered.
Note that the static mutex allocated in xInit does  not need to be freed.
Note that the stream may be filtered, in which case the stat result may be inaccurate, as the filter may inflate or deflate the number of bytes that we can read.
Note that the structure of the sqlite3_vfs object changes in the transaction between SQLite version 3.5.9 and 3.6.0 and yet the iVersion field was not modified.
Note that the table for "space" includes everything "isspace" gives, including VT in the default locale.
Note that the tables in chartables are dependent on the locale, and may mark arbitrary characters as digits - but the PCRE compiling code expects to handle only 0-9, a-z, and A-Z as digits when compiling.
Note that the trunk page is not really full until it contains usableSize/4 - 2 entries, not usableSize/4 - 8 entries as we have coded.
Note that the values returned are one less that the values that should be passed into sqlite3BtreeSetSafetyLevel().
Note that the virtual term must be tagged with TERM_VNULL.
Note that there are substantial restrictions on the use of suspension --- see the documentation.
Note that there is no code from the gd package in this file
Note that there may be an auto-callout at the start of a condition.
Note that these values are always the ASCII ones, even in EBCDIC environments.
Note that this also affects what script_path_translated points to.
Note that this call deletes the  saved position info stored by saveCursorPosition(), so there can be at most one effective restoreCursorPosition() call after each  saveCursorPosition().
Note that this can never happen in an SQLite data file, as all cells are at least 4 bytes.
Note that this code only handles characters in the BMP.
Note that this function is called only for ANY or ANYCRLF.
Note that this implementation requires a version of pthreads that supports recursive mutexes.
Note that this is a temporary hack that should be fixed soon.
Note that this may be an under estimate because there are 6939.6896 days in a metonic cycle not 6940, but it will never be an over estimate.
Note that this read relies on the __sync call above preventing the compiler from caching the value read out of memory.
Note that this will ignore any methodCall.
Note that we always assume the path is not empty and nul terminated
Note that we cannot use the BASE64 alphabet here, because it contains "/" and "+": both are unacceptable for simple inclusion into URLs.
Note that we cannot use the value of "length" to check for sufficient bytes left, because the other case of the character may have more or fewer bytes.
Note that we don't try to then combine the second and third instr into a single bundle.
Note that we must not include the OP_KETRxxx opcodes here, because they all imply an unlimited repeat.
Note that we really just look for LF terminated lines.
Note that we rely on the semaphores being zeroed when they are created.
Note that we truncate to zero bytes as truncating to the journal_size_limit might leave a corrupt WAL file on disk.
Note that we use memcpy() rather than strncpy() in case there are binary zeros in the string.
Note that when there are multiple overflow cells, it is always the case that they are sequential and adjacent.
Note that zNum must contain exactly 19 characters.
Note that zip- based phar archives cannot support signatures.
Note that, for Perl compatibility, SKIP with an argument does NOT set nomatch_mark.
Note this call checks the environment values TMP and TEMP (in order) first.
Note we need not unload belowerrN because it is for the dummy column before or after the actual array.
Note(prenaux): More than one line, we need to layout the crossAxis according to alignContent.
Note, however, that the subtrees in Expr.x.pList or Expr.x.pSelect are always separately allocated, regardless of whether or not EP_Reduced is set.
Note, that now (4.1.3) we always send metadata in reply to COM_STMT_EXECUTE (even if it is not necessary), so either this or previous branch always works.
Note:  NC_MinMaxAgg must have the same value as SF_MinMaxAgg and SQLITE_FUNC_MINMAX.
Note: A break point must always set the correct id and type A set breakpoint function must always map new points
Note: FILE_SEARCH and FILE_REGEX do not actually copy anything, but setup pointers into the source
Note: If your memory-checker has flagged the allocation below as a memory leak, it is probably because you either forgot to call pcre_free_study() (or pcre16_free_study()) on the pcre_extra (or pcre16_extra) object, or you called said function after having cleared the PCRE_EXTRA_EXECUTABLE_JIT bit from the "flags" field of the object.
Note: In SSE3, we could also use MOVDDUP and MOVSLDUP.
Note: SPACE and PXSPACE used to be different because Perl excluded VT from "space", but from Perl 5.18 it's included, so both categories are treated the same here.
Note: The following set of if(...) statements must be in the same order as the corresponding entries in the struct at the top of fts5BestIndexMethod().
Note: This block also runs if one of the special errors handled  above has occurred.
Note: This list isn't exhaustive, but should cover common cases.
Note: This method is disabled on MacOS X 10.7 and iOS version 5.0 and will always return SQLITE_MISUSE.
Note: We pass in the pointer to the server_context in case this is handled by a different thread.
Note: _not_ MATCH_ACCEPT
Note: a zero length key is no key at all
Note: can_cache is called only for binary operators.
Note: during a reduce, the only symbols destroyed are those which appear on the RHS of the rule, but which are not used inside the C code.
Note: errorptr points to *previous* column's array entry.
Note: for global settings sake we check from root to path
Note: if sub is called, accum must be larger that what is being subtracted.
Note: src1 is NOT immediate.
Note: strchr includes the terminating zero in the characters it considers.
Note: the calls to BtreeKeyFetch() and DataFetch() below assert()  that both the BtShared and database handle mutexes are held.
Note: the test here for php_stream_udp_socket_ops is important, because we want the default to be TCP sockets so that the openssl extension can re-use this code.
Note: there must not be a mixture of XPG3 specs and non-XPG3 specs in the same format string.
Note: this cast is safe, because the origin data point was an int that was cast to a (const char *).
Note: this code is harmless on little-endian machines.
Note: when reporting iJVM_EVENT_TYPE_ENTER_NIDS, there is no need to fill in the stack_id field in the iJIT_Method_NIDS structure, as VTune fills it.
Notes On Invalid UTF-8:  This routine never allows a 7-bit character (0x00 through 0x7f) to be encoded as a multi-byte character.
Notes:  A pager is never in WRITER_DBMOD or WRITER_FINISHED state if the connection is open in WAL mode.
Nothing (not even the first header) has been written to the journal.
Nothing actually happens until the cursor is used to read a record.
Nothing allowed
Nothing else can go wrong, so otherwise SQLITE_OK is returned.
Nothing in SQLite requires multiple threads.
Nothing in this file or anywhere else in SQLite does any kind of encryption.
Nothing is guaranteed in this state - the file may or may not be locked and the database size is unknown.
Nothing matched the range, stop processing
Nothing points to this buffer now, free it
Nothing stored during the first run.
Nothing to check...
Nothing to do
Nothing to do at end-of-loop for a single-pass
Nothing to do if we got an empty string
Nothing to do.
Nothing to store for UPSERT/LOAD DATA
Nothing will break if it doesn't work.
Notice is thrown after creation of the property, to avoid EG(std_property_info) being overwritten in an error handler.
Notice that because of the way SQLite parses compound SELECTs, the individual selects always group from left to right.
Notice that when returning from a function the stack pointer is the address of the function return.
Notice the difference between moveToLeftmost() and moveToRightmost().

OVERVIEW   The RBU extension requires that the RBU update be packaged as an SQLite database.
O_NOFOLLOW to prevent us from following evil symlinks
Object being parsed at the point of error
Object completely outside of query region
Object declarations
Object describing the transient index
Object for iterating through a single segment, visiting each term/rowid pair in the segment.
Object for iterating through the merged results of one or more segments, visiting each term/rowid pair in the merged data.
Object for pair-wise doclist merging
Object fully contained within query region
Object handlers for Transliterator class (and subclasses)
Object iterator
Object iterator for column names
Object partially overlaps query region
Object reference count
Object store not available during request shutdown
Object to allocate and return
Object to populate
Object to return
Object used to iterate through all "coalesced phrase instances" in  a single column of the current row.
Object used to lock page 1
Object used to represent a single file opened and mmapped to provide shared memory.
Object used to represent an shared memory buffer.
Object used to write leaf nodes
Object used to write to the file
Objects are rarely larger than 2MiB limit of a 3-byte varint.
Objects created via ZEND_NEW are only fully initialized after the DO_FCALL (constructor call)
Obscure case for non-leaf-data trees: If the cell at pCell was previously stored on a leaf node, and its reported size was 4 bytes, then it may actually be smaller than this  (see btreeParseCellPtr(), 4 bytes is the minimum size of any cell).
Obsoleted by DTrace probes
Obtain a CHECKPOINT lock and then backfill as much information as we can from WAL into the database.
Obtain a RESERVED lock on the database file.
Obtain a lock on the table whose root page is iTab.
Obtain a pointer to a mapping of a single 32KiB page of the *-shm file.
Obtain a pointer to the iPage'th page of the wal-index.
Obtain a reference to a memory mapped page object for page number pgno.
Obtain a reference to an r-tree node.
Obtain a reference to the index structure and allocate a new segment-id for the new level-0 segment.
Obtain a reference to the leaf node that contains the entry  about to be deleted.
Obtain a reference to the root node to initialize Rtree.iDepth
Obtain all b-tree mutexes before making any calls to BtreeRollback().
Obtain an exclusive lock on all byte in the locking range not already locked by the caller.
Obtain authorization to do a recursive query
Obtain db Handle
Obtain db Handler
Obtain or release the WRITER lock.
Obtain relevant filename and lineno
Obtain the BtShared mutex associated with B-Tree handle p.
Obtain the STATIC_MASTER mutex.
Obtain the average docsize (in pages).
Obtain the current thread id
Obtain the file timestamps, *before* actually compiling them, otherwise we have a race-condition.
Obtain the mutex p.
Obtain the page at pgnoRoot
Obtain the page from this cache
Obviously the CRT version will be useful more often.
Obviously, in a real application you might want to do things other than print them.
Of course, updating the input segments also involves deleting a bunch of blocks from the segments table.

Often, sample i of each block of N effective samples has (i+1) fields.
Often, v-tables store their data in other SQLite tables, which are queried from within xNext() and other v-table methods using prepared queries.
Oh, and it is also binary safe, ie it can handle strings with embedded NULLs, so long as the real length is passed in.
Oid is unsigned int, we don't need this code, where LONG is wider

Ok for uniqueness
Ok to return a row more than once
Ok, in order to use the hash, we have to support n-len strings instead of null terminated strings (since in set_value and walk_hdf we are merely using part of the HDF name for lookup, and that might be a const, and we don't want the overhead of allocating/copying that data out...)  Since HASH doesn't maintain any data placed in it, merely pointers to it, we use the HDF node itself as the key, and have specific comp/hash functions which just use the name/name_len as the key.
Ok, we're doing some weirdness here...

Our little 7-bit alpha channel trick costs us a bit here.
Our method of efficiently finding nearest colors is based on the "locally sorted search" idea described by Heckbert and on the incremental distance calculation described by Spencer W.

PCRE DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM           *
PCRE added it at release 8.34.
PCRE does not allow closing square brackets in POSIX class names.
PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.
PCRE is thread-clean and doesn't use any global variables in the normal sense.
PCRE might get stuck if the input buffer is too big.
PCRE specific options
PCRE supports POSIX class stuff inside a class.
PCRE was changed at release 8.34.
PCRE_DEBUG is not defined when building a production library.
PCRE_ERROR_NULL means that the selected normal or partial matching mode is not compiled.
PCRE_EXTRA enables extensions to Perl in the matter of escapes.
PCRE_INCLUDED
PCRE_UTF16 has the same value as PCRE_UTF8.
PCache object
PDO error (if any) has already been raised at this point.
PDO_USE_MYSQLND
PENDING:   A single process may hold a PENDING lock on a file at any one time.
PENDING_BYTE defines the beginning of the locks.
PENDING_LOCK may not be passed directly to sqlite3OsLock().

Pass back current position
Pass back the character offset and error code for an invalid string if a results vector is available.
Pass back the position in the pattern so that it can be displayed to the user for diagnosing the error.
Pass iSavepoint as the second argument to the virtual table method invoked.
Pass invalid mode to OCIConnectionPoolCreate
Pass the expected checksum down to the FTS index module.
Passed as opaque in malloc callbacks
Passing NULL remove the existing comment
Passing NULL to HeapFree is undefined.
Passing a NULL pointer to sqlite3_free() is harmless.
Passing a value less than or equal to zero turns off all busy handlers.
Passing a zero or  negative value indicates no limit.
Passing an empty string ("") or SQL NULL value as the second argument is the same as invoking the 1 argument version of upper() or lower().
Passing any other pointer in to this routine results in undefined and probably undesirable behavior.
Passing modules with full path is not supported for dynamically loaded extensions
Passing zero or a negative value as the nFrame parameter disables automatic checkpoints entirely.

Perhaps the caller will want to call strcmp to break the tie.
Perhaps the most important point is the difference between MEMTYPE_HEAP and MEMTYPE_LOOKASIDE.
Perhaps the name is a reference to the ROWID
Perhaps the next process to come along will be able to rollback the database.
Perhaps use FILE_ID_BOTH_DIR_INFO Structure.
Perhaps we should just compute leading 28 bits of S once and for all and pass them and a shift to quorem, so it can do shifts and ors to compute the numerator for q.
Perhaps we should keep this brigade hanging around and try to write it later.
Periodically, the content of the WAL is transferred back into the database file in an operation called a "checkpoint".
Perl + named group
Perl and POSIX space are the same
Perl compatible options
Perl gives an error if they are encountered at the top level, so we'll do that too.
Perl has changed over the years.
Perl recursion/subroutine syntax
Perl space used to exclude VT, but from Perl 5.18 it is included, which means that Perl space and POSIX space are now identical.
Perl style string increment
Perl treats a hyphen as a literal in such circumstances.

Persistent WAL mode
Persistent connection stubs are also counted as they have private session pools
Persistent connections have private session pools
Persistent connections: For old close semantics we artificially bump up the refcount to prevent the non-persistent destructor from getting called until request shutdown.
Persistent connections: two list-types le_pconn, le_conn and a plist where hashed connection info is stored together with index pointer to the actual link of type le_pconn in the list.
Persistent font cache until explicitly cleared
Persisting the files is useful when other processes that do not have write permission on the directory containing the database file want to read the database file, as the WAL and shared memory files must exist in order for the database to be readable.
PgHdr is added by the pcache.c layer and contains information used to keep track of which pages are "dirty".
PgHdr1 contains information needed to look up a page by its page number.
PgHdr1 is an extension added by this module (pcache1.c).

SQLite calls this  routine to find out if it has reached the end of a result set.
SQLite calls this function immediately after a call to unixDlSym() or unixDlOpen() fails (returns a null pointer).
SQLite can be compiled with or without mutexes.
SQLite code assumes this function cannot fail.
SQLite connection to register module with
SQLite copies of the current page cache implementation into that object.
SQLite does not make this guarantee explicitly, but in practice there are always either more than 20 bytes of allocated space following the nNode bytes of contents, or two zero bytes.
SQLite doesn't use it to indicate "exclusive access" as it is usually understood.
SQLite error code
SQLite expects that the sqlite3_file.pMethods element will be valid after xOpen returns regardless of the success or failure of the xOpen call.
SQLite function call context
SQLite happens to pass a pointer to this buffer when using xAccess() or xOpen() to operate on the *-wal file.
SQLite has a similar macro called ArraySize().
SQLite is careful to deallocate every mutex that it allocates.
SQLite is strongly typed, but the typing is dynamic not static.
SQLite itself will never use anything near this amount.
SQLite makes no use of subtype itself.
SQLite makes the (reasonable) assumption that all bytes of a sector are written together by hardware.
SQLite maps the regexp() function to the regexp() operator such that the following two are equivalent:  zString REGEXP zPattern regexp(zPattern, zString)  Uses the following ICU regexp APIs:  uregex_open() uregex_matches() uregex_close()
SQLite never tries to read past the end of a rollback journal file
SQLite never uses the database page that contains the pending byte.
SQLite no longer uses thread-specific data so this routine is now a no-op.
SQLite only considers US-ASCII (or EBCDIC) characters.
SQLite processes all times and dates as julian day numbers.
SQLite provides the rowid of the row to delete, which can be used to find the leaf on which the entry resides (argument pLeaf).
SQLite scalar function context
SQLite sets the dataOnly flag if the size of the file is unchanged.
SQLite still works when you do this, but concurrency is reduced since only a single process can be reading the database at a time.
SQLite supports many different ways to resolve a constraint error.
SQLite used to support LinuxThreads.
SQLite uses dynamic typing for the values it stores.
SQLite uses this trick to improve the performance of CREATE INDEX commands.
SQLite value pRowid contains the rowid of a row that may or may not be present in the FTS3 table.
SQLite varints are big-endian are are limited to 9 bytes in length whereas FTS3 varints are little-endian and can be up to 10 bytes in length (in theory).
SQLite will never do either.
SQLite will never invoke xInit() more than once without an intervening call to xShutdown().
SQLite will not operate with these drivers.
SQLite will only access or modify this field while holding a particular static mutex.
SQLite will only request a recursive mutex in cases where it really needs one.
SQLite will still work with LinuxThreads provided that (1) there is no more than one connection  per database file in the same process and (2) database connections do not move across threads.
SQLite will typically create one cache instance for each open database file, though this is not guaranteed.
SQLite will unwind its stack and return an error.
SQLite will use read() and write() to access data beyond this point from now on.
SQLite will use the extra szExtra bytes on each page to store metadata about the underlying database page on disk.
SQLite's knowledge of upper and lower case equivalents extends only to the 26 characters used in the English language.
SQLite's versions are identical to the standard versions assuming a locale of "C".

Segment "age".
Segment Prefix
Segment doclist indexes:  Doclist indexes are themselves b-trees, however they usually consist of a single leaf record only.
Segment id to load from
Segment interior nodes **** Segment interior nodes store blockids for subtree nodes and terms to describe what data is stored by the each subtree.
Segment just written
Segment leaf nodes **** Segment leaf nodes store terms and doclists, ordered by term.
Segment leaves:  TERM/DOCLIST FORMAT:  Most of each segment leaf is taken up by term/doclist data.
Segment merges overwrite older data for a particular docid with newer data, so deletes or updates will eventually overtake the earlier data and knock it out.
Segment merging **** To amortize update costs, segments are grouped into levels and merged in batches.

Similar code as PUSH_BACKTRACK macro.
Similar is true for Mac OS X.
Similar padding is added in the fts3DoclistOrMerge() function.
Similar to fts3SqlStmt().
Similar to sqlite3Fts3GetVarint(), except that the output is truncated to a 32-bit integer before it is returned.
Similarly, for ON INSERT triggers the values stored in the OLD.* registers are never accessed, and so are not allocated by the caller.
Similarly, iUpper is to be set to the estimate of the number of rows less than the upper bound of the range query.
Similarly, if a client successfully reads a wal-index header (i.e. the  checksum test is successful) and finds that the version field is not WALINDEX_MAX_VERSION, then no read-transaction is opened and SQLite returns SQLITE_CANTOPEN.
Similarly, if the 'magic' value is invalid, ignore the whole WAL file.

Similarly, values accessed by AFTER triggers are only included in the returned mask if the TRIGGER_AFTER bit is set in tr_tm.
Similarly, xMutexAlloc() must not use SQLite memory allocation for a static mutex.

Simply extend the current range.
Since  this means an in-memory pager performs no IO at all, it cannot encounter  either SQLITE_IOERR or SQLITE_FULL during rollback or while finalizing  a journal file.
Since "b" is a non-hidden column but "a" is hidden, the TF_OOOHidden attribute would apply in this case.
Since "docid" is an  alias for "rowid", use the xRowid() method to obtain the value.
Since ArraySize(azCompileOpt) is normally in single digits, a linear search is adequate.
Since Content-Type maybe part of user's headers we need to do this check first.
Since Grandfathered , no value , do nothing , retutn NULL
Since Grandfathered, no value, do nothing, retutn NULL
Since I'm too lazy to
Since Lookup() never goes to disk, it never has to deal with locks or journal files.
Since SQLite does not define USE_PREAD in any form by default, we will not attempt to define _XOPEN_SOURCE.
Since Unicode code points in that range are not disallowed in any document type, we could do nothing.
Since WhereClause contains an 8-byte field (type Bitmask) it must be aligned on an 8-byte boundary on some architectures.
Since a month is defined to be a lunar cycle (new moon to new moon), this 11 1/4 day difference cannot be overcome by adding days to a month as with the Gregorian calendar, so an entire month is periodically added to the year, making some years 13 months long.
Since a schema-lock excludes all other database users, the write-lock would be redundant.
Since a system call has failed, errno should be non-zero.
Since all other locks require a read-lock on one of the bytes within this range, this ensures that no other locks are held on the database.
Since balance() may move the cursor, zero the BtCursor.info.nSize and BTCF_ValidNKey variables.
Since both locks came from the same process, the second overrides the first, even though they were on different file descriptors opened on different file names.
Since both numerators are complex NaNs, it seems that the results should agree in kind.
Since files cannot be loaded via this kind of stub, no parameters are accepted when the Phar object is zip- or tar-based.
Since here we are handling internal functions only we can add the keyword flag.
Since holding READ_LOCK(0) prevents a checkpoint from happening, this is usually correct.
Since in this case the query may return a maximum of one row, the results are already in the requested order.
Since it is a virtual-table, the Table structure contains a pointer to the head of a linked list of VTable structures.
Since major is a function on SVR4, we cannot use `ifndef major'.
Since mem5.szAtom is always at least 8 and 32-bit integers are used, it is not actually possible to reach this limit.
Since pLeft and pRight are both a column references, their collating sequence should always be defined.
Since popen() doesn't indicate if the internal fork() doesn't work (e.g. the shell can't be executed) we explicitly set it to 0 to be sure we don't catch any older errno value.
Since return is in  sec.
Since schema Tables do not use lookaside, this number should not change.
Since some systems only support mandatory file-locks, we do not read or write data from the region of the file on which locks are applied.
Since structures used in those callback are freed, we need to use an other callback to which avoid segfaults.
Since sunset varies, the day is assumed to begin at 6:00 P.M.
Since that seems to violate the DRY principle, we check against it and abort.
Since the VCWD functionality isn't used here, a sophisticated functionality would have to be reimplemented to know ahead there are no files with invalid names there.
Since the class is not an interface it needs to be declared as a abstract class.
Since the comparison is to be performed with no conversions applied to the operands, set the affinity to apply to pRight to  SQLITE_AFF_BLOB.
Since the flags should be set, we just fallback to the register mode.
Since the length of a metonic cycle is a constant, this is a simple calculation, except that it requires an intermediate value which is bigger that 32 bits.
Since the minimum repeat, is zero the invalid case is basically the same as an empty case.
Since the names of named mutexes, semaphores, file mappings etc are case-sensitive, take advantage of that by uppercasing the mutex name and using that as the shared filemapping name.
Since the page is already in the journal file (recorded in Pager.pInJournal) and the PGHDR_NEED_SYNC flag is cleared, if the page is written to again within this transaction, it will be marked as dirty but the PGHDR_NEED_SYNC flag will not be set.
Since the pager is in exclusive mode, there is no need to drop any locks either.
Since the permanent table is hidden by the TEMP table, we can also safely ignore the index on the permanent table.
Since the table has just been created, it contains no data and the index initialization step can be skipped.
Since the values are variably sized and can get quite large, they are stored separately from the hashes in a garbage-collected heap.
Since the zHeader buffer is only Pager.pageSize bytes in size, more than one call to sqlite3OsWrite() may be required to populate the entire journal header sector.
Since then, we have restructured how trigger code is generated and so this condition is no longer  possible.
Since there can be a very large number of doclists to merge, the merging is done pair-wise using the TermSelect object.
Since these values do not necessarily correspond to columns in SELECT statement pParent, zero them before transfering the ORDER BY clause.
Since this code is only executed in PAGER_OPEN state for a hot-journal rollback, it is guaranteed that the page-cache is empty if the pager is in OPEN state.
Since this is handled as a fatal error by SQLite, vfs implementations should endeavor to prevent this by setting mxPathname to a sufficiently large value.
Since this is repeated in exif_process_IFD_TAG make it a notice here
Since trees are built from the bottom up, things will be described from the bottom up.
Since version 2.8.0, the journal format contains additional sanity checking information.
Since we do not know, guess 1 million.
Since we have no way of knowing the true length either, we'll bump up our buffer size to a reasonable size, just in case
Since we successfully read a char above, partial matching must occure.

Snippet to extract
So I put a right shift to loose the lsb.
So PHP would crash by allowing the call.
So a jump past the last instruction of the program is the same as executing Halt.
So a malloc failure  during a hash table resize is a benign fault.
So add an opcode to expire all compiled SQL statements after modifying a pragma value.
So add the EP_Collate marker on X to cause it to be searched first.
So all routines, even the public interface to SQLite, can use a pointer to this structure.
So any terms for which all prerequisites are satisfied by  mExtra may be specified as "usable" in all calls to xBestIndex.
So are Unicode property matches, if supported.
So assume sqlite3GetVdbe() is always successful here.
So assuming either that either the "old" or "new" version of the value is read, and not some arbitrary value that would never be written by a real client, things are still  safe.
So at this point the data is stored in some number of sorted PMAs within temporary files on disk.
So at this point we may safely modify the database file in any way, knowing that if a power failure occurs, the original database will be reconstructed from the  journal file.
So avoid calling fchown() if we are not running as root.
So bHasStat may not be 2.
So call it now.
So call pager_error() on the way out to make any error persistent.
So calling PmaReaderNext() on this PmaReader before any of the multi-threaded PmaReaders takes better advantage of multi-processor hardware.
So construct a virtual term of that form.
So copy it in one go.
So create a fake list to simulate this.
So create a substitute.
So define the lock related functions as no-ops.
So discard this candidate as not viable.
So do additional corruption checks inside this routine and return SQLITE_CORRUPT if any problems are found.
So do not bother - just return true.
So do not go to the disk to fetch the content.
So do not set the "may-abort" flag in this case.
So do not try to make this is into a redefinable interface.
So do not write to the disk again.
So do nothing in this case.
So each chunk consists from 512 pages.
So enlarge if first, then do the append.
So extract the trunk page itself and use it as the newly  allocated page
So far no cases are known where it would be an issue.
So far, so good.
So far, two transports have been defined.
So first try to lookup the overflow page-list cache, if any, then fall back to the getOverflowPage() function.
So for example, if "samplelib" cannot be loaded, then names like "samplelib.so" or "samplelib.dylib" or "samplelib.dll" might be tried also.
So get a WRITE lock and try again.
So go ahead and allocate enough space, just in case.
So halt it now.
So if either zTarget or zRbu begin with "file:", it will be interpreted as an SQLite  database URI, not a regular file name.
So if some other shared-cache client already has a write-lock  on page 1, the transaction cannot be opened.
So if speed is of utmost importance, it makes sense to disable the mutexes.
So if the height of the input segment b-trees is N, and input segments are merged eight at a time, updating the input segments at the end of an incremental-merge requires writing (8*(1+N)) blocks.
So if the power fails at the wrong moment they might get out of sync.
So if the sort is stable, there is never any reason to compare PK fields and they can be ignored for a small performance boost.
So if there exists more than one reference to this page, then it  must not really be an overflow page and the database must be corrupt.
So if this routine fails, the database should be rolled back.
So if this routine is called with p equal to the t3 query, then pPrior will be the t2 query.
So if this routine returns 2, then you do not really know for certain if the two expressions are the same.
So in this environment, uncomment the following line.
So in this variation of CheckReservedLock(), *pResOut is set to true if any lock is held on the file and false if the file is unlocked.
So invoke the destructor, then set the value to a 64-bit integer.
So isInit must not be set until the very end of this routine.
So it is OK for it to always fail.
So it is safe to truncate the database file to its minimum required size.
So it needs to be broken into sections.
So it needs to be freed here.
So it safe to end the transaction by manually setting the autoCommit flag to true and detaching the vacuum database.
So it's easiest to filter these calls out here.
So it's very easy to determine the CHUNK owning the certain pointer.
So jump over the coroutine implementation to address P2.
So just return true.
So make sure that the regFree1 register is not reused for other purposes and possibly overwritten.
So make the Enter and Leave procedures no-ops.
So mark the allocation as a benign.
So move the page that does into the  gap left by the deleted root-page.
So no other connection may be writing the db.
So not loading those that are not going to be used eliminates some redundant opcodes.
So omit the OP_RealAffinity opcode if it is present
So omit the rest of the file if PRAGMAs are omitted from the build.
So only two  constraints are coded.
So pushing a state here evens the stacks.
So quickly guess a minimum result size based on that
So really the only thing this code accomplishes is to quieten purify.
So redefine fcntl() to be something that always succeeds.
So remove them from the pDirty list here.
So reset the colUsed mask
So row_packet's destructor function won't efree() it
So run recovery to do exactly that.
So search forward to see where said rowid really is.
So set JUMPIFNULL to make sure we do the OP_Found if any of the parent-key values are NULL (at this point it is known that none of the child key values are).
So set pKey2 to NULL to prevent vdbeSorterCompare() from decoding pReadr2 again.
So skip this term.
So substr(x,1,1) returns the first character of x.
So that buffer is not  available for use within this function.
So that is what is done.
So that sizeof(Mem) is a multiple of 8
So that the segment consists of a single leaf and a single interior (root) node.
So that they appear as part of the callers  transaction, these accesses need to be made via the same database  connection as that used to execute SQL operations on the virtual table.
So that when a  document such as "I won first place" is tokenized, entries are added to the FTS index for "i", "won", "first", "1st" and "place".
So the 'y' rule is that 'y' is a consonant unless it is followed by another consonent.
So the assertTruncateConstraint() call is no longer correct.
So the bitmap is usually sparse and has low cardinality.
So the calling function (pcache.c) will never have a createFlag of 1 on a non-purgeable cache.
So the code within the switch statement will break with convention and be flush-left.
So the computation is done on a copy of the SELECT statement that defines the view.
So the condition described in the above paragraph is not assert()able.
So the content cannot be trusted.
So the effects of disabling the no-content optimization here are confined to those pages that lie between the end of the database image and the end of the database file.
So the extra complication to make this rule less restrictive is probably not worth the effort.
So the following array cannot be const.
So the list is never empty at this point.
So the longest string that can be completely written will be n-1 characters.
So the maximum header length results from a 3-byte type for each of the maximum of 32768 columns plus three extra bytes for the header length itself.
So the mimimum allowable IDF is (1e-6) - roughly the same as a term that appears in just over half of set of 5,000,000 documents.
So the new function is not good for anything by itself.
So the overhead of the incremental merge is somewhere between 8 and 24 blocks.
So the phonome SCI invades both S and C.
So the pointer is safe to use later on.
So the redefinition macros are only valid if the SQLITE_CORE macros is undefined.
So the result will be either the default value or a NULL.
So the temp files are still identified, but anybody smart enough to figure out the code is also likely smart enough to know that calling the developer will not help get rid of the file.
So the unixInodeInfo object contains a pointer to this unixShmNode object and the unixShmNode object is created only when needed.
So there are no more results and we should just return FALSE, error_no has been set
So there is never a forest to deal with.
So there is no chance of overflowing the zOut buffer.
So there is no need to zero the journal  header.
So there is no way to know at compile-time whether or not thread A can override locks on thread B.
So there might be multiple references to the returned pointer.
So there's no harm in leaving this code.
So this forward declaration is required.
So this next line is harmless in that case.
So this opcode can cause persistent changes to registers P1 and P3.
So this routine is never called.
So this routine returns SQLITE_BUSY in that case and no write transaction is started.
So to avoid this error, zero the first 4 bytes of temp space here.
So to determine whether an error has actually occurred, it is also necessary to call GetLastError().
So to find the start of the poslist, skip forward 2 bytes then over a varint.
So two or three index blocks are sufficient to cover a typical 10 megabyte WAL file, assuming 1K pages.
So under Vista, we try to map into a hard coded predefined addresses in high memory.
So unique matches will be used to generate a help message but non-unique one will be used to list alternatives.
So we are forced to probe it
So we are really looking for an instance of a consonant followed by a vowel.
So we assume it matches every row.
So we can always safely abort as soon as the first unused slot is found
So we can gdFree it with impunity.
So we can leave it out when NDEBUG is defined.
So we cannot safely invoke alloca (N) if N exceeds 4096.
So we cannot stop searching after the first match  because the first match might be for one of the deleted indices or tables and not the table/index that is actually being moved.
So we deal with that case by considering the UTF-8 encoding.
So we define our own static constants here using nothing larger than a 32-bit integer constant.
So we disable usage of interned strings as hash keys especually for this table.
So we do not need to make a copy of the filename.
So we don't even try to recover from an EINTR.
So we don't worry about memory barriers and such here.
So we either have to look for one or the other, never both.
So we forward declare the I/O methods.
So we goto out_err.
So we have to define the macros in different ways depending on the compiler.
So we have to do our own lookup to get env vars.
So we have to introduce  this magic value that the code knows to handle differently.
So we have to link generator call frame with caller call frame.
So we might as well translate every INSTEAD OF trigger into a BEFORE trigger.
So we might as well use bogus content rather than reading content from disk.
So we must not search for built-ins when creating a new function.
So we must test for alnum specially.
So we reinvent the wheel.
So we run it once during initialization.
So we test the effects of a malloc() failing and the sqlite3OsXXX() function returning SQLITE_IOERR_NOMEM using the DO_OS_MALLOC_TEST macro.
So we use only LockFile() and UnlockFile().
So we want a .re scanner to find it.
So we want first of all to clean up all data and then move to tables destruction.
So we want the default action to be for NDEBUG to be set and NDEBUG to be undefined only if SQLITE_DEBUG is set.
So we will commandeer the 9th cell to use as storage for an array of pointers to trigger subprograms.
So we're safe enough.
So we've a single efree() later.
So when in doubt, return TRUE.
So writing '.' to the pipe is sufficient.
So xCheckReservedLock may  return true because the caller itself is holding an EXCLUSIVE lock (but doesn't know it because of a previous error in xUnlock).
So zero the cached wal-index header to ensure that next time the pager opens a snapshot on this database it knows that the cache needs to be reset.
So, attempt an fsync  and (for now) ignore the overhead of a superfluous fcntl call.
So, error_log is used by - SysV init launch php-fpm as a daemon - Systemd launch php-fpm in foreground
So, even if an error occurs in the pager layer, reset the b-tree objects internal state to indicate that the write transaction has been closed.
So, for a system with nPrefix prefix indexes configured, the block of absolute levels that corresponds to language-id iLangid and index  iIndex starts at absolute level ((iLangid * (nPrefix+1) + iIndex) * 1024).
So, for an ON INSERT trigger, the value passed to this function as parameter reg is not a readable register, although registers (reg+N) through  (reg+N+N+1) are.
So, if sibling page iOld had the same page number as pNew, and if pCell really was a part of sibling page iOld (not a divider or overflow cell), we can skip updating the pointer map entries.
So, in other words, this routine advances *ppPoslist so that it points to the next docid in the doclist, or to the first byte past the end of the doclist.
So, in the example above, the cursor numbers would be mapped into integers 0 through 7.
So, just in case this has happened, clear the changeCountDone flag now.
So, retry instead.
So, the SQL statements:  A LIKE B  is implemented as like(B, A).
So, the SQL statements:  A LIKE B  is implemented as like(B,A).
So, the approach used is to take the given day number and round it to the closest molad of Tishri (first new moon of the year).
So, the first molad was 5 hours 793 halakim after the start of Tishri 1, 0001 (which was Monday September 7, 4761 B.C.
So, this macro is defined instead.
So, we always use fdatasync() if it is available, regardless of the value of the dataOnly flag.
So, we do this code for all non 11g versions.
So, we have this declaration here to fix it
So, we need to take care of that.
So, we only lock if our first test of Inited was false
So, we use cfg_get_string here to check it this once.
So, we will not do anything.

Sometimes, if P3 is the same register as P2, the implementation is able to avoid a memcpy().
Sometimes, utf8mb4 is just utf8 but the old charsets are utf8mb3.
Somewhat arbitrary length limit here, but should be way more than anyone needs and avoids file-level warnings later on if we exceed MAX_PATH

Such a cell consists of a 4 byte page number followed by a variable length integer.
Such a file descriptor may exist if a database connection was closed but the associated file descriptor could not be closed because some other file descriptor open on the same file is holding a file-lock.
Such column values may still be stored as integers, for space efficiency, but after extraction we want them to have only a real value.
Such expressions could be omitted from the code completely.
Such fsyncs are not needed on newer journaling filesystems, but are required on older filesystems.
Such groups are non-capturing and are not assertions of any kind.
Such interned strings are shared across all PHP processes
Such small cells will be rare, but they are possible.

Thanks to "Super Pikeman."
Thanks to Aaron Giles for this idea.
Thanks to Frank Warmerdam for pointing out the issue.
Thanks to Frank Warmerdam.
Thanks to Geert Jansen
Thanks to Ian Taylor for noticing this possibility and sending the original patch.
Thanks to John Buckman.
Thanks to Robin Houston for the original version of this logic.
Thanks to Steven Brown.
That approach would require an extra instruction and memory reference in every stack growth prolog and would also require rewriting the code that 8c generates for extern registers.
That aside, the greatest value wins, but we can't know that it will until we've scanned both numbers to know that they have the same magnitude, so we remember it in BIAS.
That capability is no longer provided.
That case is handled by the calling routine.
That clips too, so don't clip twice.
That concludes the basic part of this demonstration program.
That confuses minit, so we remove that signal stack here before calling the regular mstart.
That could help to adjust intersections  to produce a nice interior_extrema.
That detail is handled by the outer sqlite3_step() wrapper procedure.
That fact is verified in memsys5Init().
That file uses //export so it can't put function definitions in the "C" import comment.
That function does the same as this one, except that it deals with more complicated cases as well.
That gives a significant speed improvement.
That in turn  helps the operating system to deliver pages from the disk more rapidly.
That integer is 0 to disable persistent WAL mode or 1 to enable persistent WAL mode.
That integer is 0 to disable zero-damage mode or 1 to enable zero-damage mode.
That is Ok, at this point the parent page is guaranteed to be marked as dirty.
That is all the insert routine needs to know about.
That is no longer true.
That is not permitted.
That is not the normal state of affairs, of course.
That is the IFD for the first thumbnail
That is the historical behavior of SQLite: prior to version 3.8.3, it never checked
That is the largest legal value, divided by the base.
That is why the "so" value is used to bump the start location rather than being passed as a PCRE "starting offset".
That is why we have a private table here.
That is, push the lookahead token onto the stack and goto state N.
That is, the final term of the snippet is always a term that requires highlighting.
That is, the match must be before or at the first newline.
That is, we allow equality in stopping tests when the round-nearest rule will give the same floating-point value as would satisfaction of the stopping test with strict inequality.
That line and all subsequent comment lines are used in the generation of the opcode.html documentation file.
That may overflow, in which case new memory is obtained from malloc().
That means that if  checkpoints are always run by a background thread or background  process, foreground threads will never block on a lengthy fsync call.
That means that if the BETWEEN term is coded, the children are skipped.
That means that we always use the same random number sequence.
That means the byte after represents a character or is the leading byte of an sequence of 8-bit code units.
That method assumes that no backtracking is possible.
That one of the jobs of this function.
That opcode is readable but not writable, though it is cast to a writable value.
That pseudo-table cursor is the one that is identified by parameter P3.
That routine is optimized for the common case of merely decrementing the cell counter BtCursor.aiIdx to the previous cell on the current page.
That routine is optimized for the common case of merely incrementing the cell counter BtCursor.aiIdx to the next cell on the current page.
That saves a few cycles in inner loops.
That seems acceptable to me, to avoid making this code hard to follow
That should be COM_FIELD_LIST.
That should be handled by the client when fetching.
That table and column will be recorded in iCursor and iColumn.
That table is guaranteed to be a b-tree table, not a virtual table.
That table is guaranteed to be a virtual table.
That was the date, now we do the tiiiime
That way, if no reads occur, no unnecessary I/O happens.
That way, if the name is longer than any in the table, the comparison will fail without reading beyond the table entry.
That way, the FileChunk object will have a size that almost exactly fills a power-of-two allocation.
That way, when multiple affinity types are concatenated into a string and used as the P4 operand, they will be more readable.
That will likely cover most cases.
That will never happend for an IdxRowid opcode, hence the NEVER() arround the check of the return value.
That will provide the minimum length (when no recursion happens).
That's a ridiculous thing to do as far as I am concerned, but with this define and the subsequent undef we limit the damage to just the actual setlocale() call in this file without turning zif_setlocale into zif_libintl_setlocale.
That's ok since a VDBE branch coverage build designed for testing the test suite only.
That's ok, break
That's the one we're interested in.
That's why for generators the execution context is allocated using a separate VM stack, thus allowing to save and restore it simply by replacing a pointer.

The BTree cursor
The BTree that contains the table
The BtCursor object is opaque to users so they cannot do the sizeof() themselves - they must call this routine.
The BtShared object that owns pPage
The BtShared this cursor points to
The BtShared.pHasContent bitvec exists to work around an obscure bug caused by the interaction of two useful IO optimizations surrounding free-list leaf pages:  1) When all data is deleted from a page and the page becomes a free-list leaf page, the page is not written to the database (as free-list leaf pages contain no meaningful data).
The Btree to which this cursor belongs
The C definitions for tracebackctxt.go.
The C standard states: "If (before argument substitution) any argument consists of no preprocessing tokens, the behavior is undefined." It turns out the gcc treats this case as a single empty string - which is what we really want - but Visual C grumbles about the lack of an argument for the macro.
The C syntax in this function definition may be unfamilar to some  programmers, so we provide the following additional explanation:  The name of the function is "ftsHashFunction".

The SQLITE_SHM_DIRECTORY compile-time option is considered "unsupported" and may go away in a future SQLite release.
The SQLITE_SYNC_FULL macro means to use the MacOSX-style full-fsync using fcntl(F_FULLFSYNC).
The SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL and SQLITE_SYNC_FULL flags determine how energetic or rigorous or forceful the sync operations are and only make a difference on Mac OSX for the default SQLite code.
The SQLITE_SYSTEM_MALLOC macro is defined automatically if neither the SQLITE_MEMDEBUG nor the SQLITE_WIN32_MALLOC macros are defined.
The SQLITE_TEST_REALLOC_STRESS compile-time option is designed to force more frequent reallocs and hence provide more opportunities for  simulated OOM faults.
The SQLITE_THREADSAFE macro must be defined as 0, 1, or 2.
The SQLITE_Transitive optimization must be enabled 2.
The SQLITE_WSD macro is used for this purpose.
The SQLite core calls this routine to retrieve the rowid for the current row of the result set.
The SQLite core has no knowledge of its size or internal structure and never deals with the sqlite3_pcache object except by holding and passing pointers to the object.
The SQLite core never uses these routines except inside an assert() and applications are advised to follow the lead of the core.
The SQLite core only provides implementations for these routines when it is compiled with the SQLITE_DEBUG flag.
The SQLite core reserves all opcodes less than 100 for its own use.
The SQLite core will never attempt to acquire or release a lock outside of this range
The SQLite database connection
The SQLite source code contains multiple implementations of these mutex routines.
The SQLite user supplies a block of memory before calling sqlite3_initialize() from which allocations are made and returned by the xMalloc() and xRealloc()  implementations.
The SRT_ operation to apply to prior selects
The SSB_CONTINUE return is useful for parenthesized groups in patterns such as (a*)b where the group provides some optional starting bytes but scanning must continue at the outer level to find at least one mandatory byte.
The STR_PTR must be released.
The SUM() function follows the (broken) SQL standard which means that it returns NULL if it sums over no inputs.
The Schema.cache_size variable is not cleared.
The Select object passed in has already been preprocessed and no errors have been found.
The SnippetIter object has just been initialized.
The Source list to check and modify
The SrcList passed as the second argument to this function contains a single entry guaranteed to resolve to table pTab.
The SrcList to be enlarged
The StatusDown() routine lowers the current value by N.
The StatusUp() routine can accept positive or negative values for N.
The Sun's ecliptic latitude is not
The Synopsis: field in comments in the vdbe.c source file gets converted to an extra string that is appended to the sqlite3OpcodeName().
The TEMP Schema is manually freed by sqlite3_close().
The TERM_LIKECOND marking indicates that the term should be coded inside a conditional such that is only evaluated on the second pass of a LIKE-optimization loop, when scanning BLOBs instead of strings.
The TEST primitive includes a "batch" number.
The TEST primitive will only see elements that were inserted before the last change in the batch number.
The TESTONLY macro is used to enclose variable declarations or other bits of code that are needed to support the arguments within testcase() and assert() macros.
The Table object to which the virtual table belongs
The Table structure pTable is really a VIEW.
The Table structure that represents the result set was constructed by selectExpander() but the type and collation information was omitted at that point because identifiers had not yet been resolved.
The TableLock structure is only used by the sqlite3TableLock() and codeTableLocks() functions.
The Trigger structure or any of its sub-components may be allocated from the lookaside buffer belonging to database handle dbMem.
The TryEnterCriticalSection() interface is only available on WinNT.
The UNION ALL operator uses this property to force the reuse of the same limit and offset registers across multiple SELECT statements.
The UNION ALL operator works fine with multiSelectOrderBy() even when there are COLLATE terms in the ORDER BY.
The UNLIKELY() function is a no-op.
The UPDATE  statement ensures that the remaining segments have contiguously allocated idx values.
The USING clause of a join
The UTF-8 string to compare against
The VACUUM command is used to clean up the database, collapse free space, etc.
The VACUUM command works as follows:  (1)  Create a new transient database file (2)  Copy all content from the database being vacuumed into the new transient database file (3)  Copy content from the transient database back into the original database.

The VDBE has been deallocated
The VDBE implements an abstract machine that runs a simple program to access and modify the underlying database.
The VDBE is guaranteed to have at least 9 cells.
The VDBE knows that a P2 value is a label because labels are always negative and P2 values are suppose to be non-negative.
The VDBE should have been allocated before this routine is called.
The VDBE under construction
The VDBE we are building
The VFS containing this xAccess method
The VFS for which this is the xOpen method

The Vdbe parse-tree explainer is also found here.
The Vdbe.aColName array contains 5n Mem structures, where n is the  number of columns of data returned by the statement.
The VdbeCoverage macros are used to set a coverage testing point for VDBE branch instructions.
The VdbeSorter object implements a multi-threaded external merge sort algorithm that is efficient even if the number of elements being sorted exceeds the available memory.
The WAL file is readonly
The WAL file to which we write
The WAL has been completely backfilled (or it is empty).
The WAL header is 32 bytes in size and consists of the following eight big-endian 32-bit unsigned integer values:  0: Magic number.
The WAL subsystem issues this signal during rare circumstances in order to fix a problem with priority inversion.
The WAL transaction is then closed.
The WAL_RECOVER_LOCK is also held so that other threads will know that this thread is running recovery.
The WHEN clause of the expression (may be NULL)
The WHERE clause
The WHERE clause for DELETE or UPDATE steps

The _DEP / _DEP_DEP variants additionally free the temporary values passed in the last / last two arguments.
The _FILE_OFFSET_BITS macro must appear first in QNX.
The aIdx array contains the set of integers from 0 to  (nIdx-1) in no particular order.
The aSpare array is used as temporary working space by the sorting algorithm.
The ability to disable the use of covering indices for full table scans is because some incorrectly coded legacy applications might malfunction when the optimization is enabled.
The ability to override this routine was added in support of the chromium sandbox.
The ability to use an output result-set column in the WHERE, GROUP BY, or HAVING clauses, or as part of a larger expression in the ORDER BY clause is not standard SQL.

The aggregate function implementation
The alert stack is cleared after imap_alerts() is called.
The algorithm is found in Knuth Vol 2.
The algorithm needs  to handle both cases well.
The algorithms are based on a preponderance of less authoritative sources.
The algorithms are complicated slightly in order to be compatible with windows systems simultaneously accessing the same database file, in case that is ever required.
The alloca() routine never returns NULL.
The allocateSpace() routine guarantees the following properties if it returns successfully
The allocated size is always at least as big as the requested size but may be larger.
The allocated space holds both the TriggerStep object and the TriggerStep.target.z string.

The alternatives to storing client_id like done below are i) display it in a probe here in oci_set_client_identifier and let the user D script correlate the connection address probe argument and the client_id.
The amount of extra space required can change depending on the compiler, target platform, and SQLite version.
The amount of information copies from WAL to database might be limited by active readers.
The antipenultimate character of the master journal name must be "9" to avoid name collisions when using 8+3 filenames.
The apVal parameter is passed a copy of the apVal argument passed by SQLite to the xUpdate() method.
The application does not need to worry about freeing the result.
The application gives SQLite a block of memory before calling sqlite3_initialize() from which allocations are made and returned by the xMalloc() and xRealloc()  implementations.
The application should never invoke either sqlite3_os_init() or sqlite3_os_end() directly.
The application should never modify anything within the sqlite3_vfs object once the object has been registered.
The application should only invoke sqlite3_initialize() and sqlite3_shutdown().

The argument is the number of microseconds we want to sleep.
The argument list
The argument may be NULL, representing an empty list.

The argument specifies alternative low-level memory allocation routines to be used in place of the memory allocation routines built into SQLite.
The argument to this macro is a file descriptor (type sqlite3_file*).
The argument to this macro must be of type u32.
The argument to this macro should be a variable.
The argument values
The arguments after _NAMELENGTH and _CONTENTSLENGTH must be explicitly cast to long in curl_formadd use since curl needs a long not an int.
The arguments are:  (1) the number of columns in the index including the rowid (or for a WITHOUT ROWID table, the number of PK columns), (2) the number of columns in the key without the rowid/pk (3) the number of rows in the index,   The third argument is only used for STAT3 and STAT4
The arguments passed to it are, in order:  void *pCtx          // Copy of 4th argument to sqlite3Fts5Tokenize() const char *pToken  // Pointer to buffer containing token int nToken          // Size of token in bytes int iStart          // Byte offset of start of token within input text int iEnd            // Byte offset of end of token within input text int iPos            // Position of token in input (first token is 0)  If the callback returns a non-zero value the tokenization is abandoned and no further callbacks are issued.

The arguments specify the block of memory to manage.
The arguments to RowSetTest are such that the rowid of the current row is inserted into the RowSet.

The array is cleared after invoking the callbacks.
The array might be stored in a local variable that will be overwritten.
The array of interior nodes that are parents of the leaf nodes start at block (start_block + (1 + end_block - start_block) / 16).
The assert is not useful in that case.
The assert() below verifies the previous sentence.
The assert_nc() macro is similar to the assert() macro, except that it is used for assert() conditions that are true only if it can be  guranteed that the database is not corrupt.
The asserts() that follow verify that assumption
The associated database
The associated database connection
The associated file-descriptor is returned.
The associated pager.
The associated pointer map entries are:  a) if the cell contains a reference to an overflow chain, the entry associated with the first page in the overflow chain, and  b) if the sibling pages are not leaves, the child page associated with the cell.
The associativity is preserved.
The assumed sector size for this process
The assumption here is that if that is happening, the other client may only be increasing the value, not decreasing it.
The assumption is that large doclists represent terms which are more likely to be query targets.
The attached database containing the blob
The attempt to extend the existing mapping failed.
The auth function should return either SQLITE_OK, SQLITE_DENY, or SQLITE_IGNORE.
The author disclaims copyright to this source code.

The b-tree layer then attempts a rollback operation.
The bFlags argument can contain the bit SQLITE_PRINTF_INTERNAL enable internal formats.
The backtrace functionality is only available with GLIBC
The backtrack path must check whether there is a next alternative.
The backup API copies the content of one database into another.
The backup module in backup.c maintains the content of this variable.
The backup process p has already copied page iPage.
The base for radix conversion
The base frame is on the machine stack, and so must not be freed.
The basic MD5 functions.
The basic blocks of regular expressions are condition checkers whose execute different commands depending on the result of the condition check.
The basic idea is that each page of the file contains N database entries and N+1 pointers to subpages.
The basic idea is to do a nested loop, one loop for each table in the FROM clause of a select.
The beginning and end of the LRU list
The behavior is undefined if the mutex  is not currently entered.
The behavior is undefined if the mutex is not currently entered by the calling thread or is not currently allocated.
The behavior is undefined if the mutex is not currently entered or is not currently allocated.
The behavior of the most recently created foreign key is adjusted accordingly.
The below are erroneous inputs, so NULL return is expected/required
The below if loop is added for NetWare to fix an abend while unloading PHP when an Apache unload command is issued on the system console.

The binary operation
The binary record
The bit is set if the corresponding page is allocated.
The bit that is set for overflow
The bitmap records up to 31 back references to help in deciding whether (.*) can be treated as anchored or not.
The bitmask datatype defined below is used for various optimizations.
The bits used for last_capture
The bits used for the overflow flag
The blame is not necessarily with GCC, though.
The blob of memory associated with  cursor 0 is stored in memory cell nMem.
The block header contains the size of the previous and the next block.
The block of page numbers associated with the first hash-table in a wal-index is smaller than usual.
The block of registers has already been deallocated by the time this routine returns.
The blocking transaction has been concluded.
The boolean index is empty
The bottom of the loop
The bottom of the main insertion loop, if the data source is a SELECT statement.
The bound variables point to them only if the user has started to fetch data (MYSQLND_STMT_USER_FETCHING).
The boundary between these two regions is determined using offsetof(Parse,nVar) so the nVar field must be the first field in the recursive region.
The bracket content will be checked by the OP_BRA/OP_CBRA case above.
The branch is temporarily terminated with OP_END when this function is called.
The branch terminates at string end
The breaking rules are as follows: 1.
The btree implementation is free to use the initial *pRes value as a hint to improve performance, but the current SQLite btree implementation does not.
The btree layer manages reference counting issues.
The btree to be checked
The btree to set the safety level on
The btree.c module deals with pointers to MemPage objects.
The btreeCursor() routine enforces that rule.
The btreeHeapInsert() routine inserts an unsigned 32-bit number onto the heap, preserving the heap property.
The btreeHeapPull() routine removes the root element from the heap (the minimum value in the heap) and then moves other nodes around as necessary to preserve the heap property.
The btreeInitPage() call has already validated the freelist.
The buffer *ppToken is set to point at is managed by the tokenizer implementation.
The buffer associated with pPrev is extended by this function if requrired.
The buffer is obtained from sqlite3_malloc().
The buffer must be aligned to an 8-byte boundary.
The buffer pointed to by argument zNode (size nNode bytes) contains an interior node of a b-tree segment.
The buffer returned in *ppOut is only valid until the next call to this function.
The buffer that zWalName points to must remain valid for the lifetime of the returned Wal* handle.
The built-in page cache is recommended for most uses.
The busy callback
The busy callback should not take any actions which modify the database connection that invoked the busy handler.
The busy-handler callback can be used when upgrading to the EXCLUSIVE lock, but not when obtaining the RESERVED lock.
The busy-handler callback is currently invoked only from within pager.c.
The busy-handler is not invoked if another connection already holds the write-lock.
The byte case is the same as non-UTF8
The byte immediately before the last 0x00 byte has the 0x80 bit set.
The byte is OK
The byte offset of the start of the page footer.
The byte offset to the first freeblock is given in the header.
The bytes to be written
The cache must not perform any reference counting.
The cache of the wal-index header must be valid to call this function.
The cache to truncate
The calendar was created in 46 B.C., but the details did not stabilize until at least 8 A.D., and perhaps as late at the 4th century.
The call assures that only valid opcodes are sent
The call below sets the pName pointer to point at the token (pName1 or pName2) that stores the unqualified table name.
The call to execSql() to attach the temp database has left the file locked (as there was more than one active statement when the transaction to read the schema was concluded.
The call to fts3AllocateSegdirIdx() will merge the segments at level iLevel+1 to  a single iLevel+2 segment if necessary.
The call to pager_unlock() will discard all in-memory pages, unlock the database file and move the pager back to OPEN state.
The call to sqlite3BtreeRollback() drops any table-locks held by this handle.
The call to sqlite3Stat4ProbeSetValue() below would return the same value.
The call to this function will effect all following calls of SOAP methods.
The callback for when the main thread has issued a command to the run loop thread.
The callback function is called when the event is first registered and when the event is cancelled.
The callback function may have defined the class

The calling routine should invoke walIteratorFree() to destroy the WalIterator object when it has finished with it.
The callout item calls an external function, if one is provided, passing details of the match so far.
The case of a zero minimum is special because of the need to stick OP_BRAZERO in front of it, and because the group appears once in the data, whereas in other cases it appears the minimum number of times.
The caseSensitive parameter determines whether or not the LIKE operator is case sensitive.
The cases of the switch statement above this line should all be indented by 6 spaces.
The cast is safe, if larger then the array will be later extended - no big deal :)
The cell content is not freed or deallocated.
The cell from the leaf node needs to be moved to the internal node to replace the deleted cell.
The cell index area
The cell index from which to extract the ID
The cell index.
The cell may contain a pointer to an overflow page.
The cell pointer array begins on the first byte after the page header.
The cell pointer array contains zero or more 2-byte numbers which are offsets from the beginning of the page to the cell content in the cell content area.
The cell pointers occur in sorted order.
The cell should normally be sized correctly.
The cell to be inserted
The cell to write
The cell-pointers and other fields of the page are not updated.
The chain does not match the policy
The chance of an undetected change is so small that it can be neglected.
The change from SHARED to RESERVED marks the beginning of a normal write operation (not a hot journal rollback).
The change may be disallowed for the following reasons:  An in-memory database can only have its journal_mode set to _OFF or _MEMORY.

The character values in the arguments will be within the valid values for the current mode (8-bit, 16-bit, UTF, etc).
The character we are checking can be multibyte.
The cheapest token in the entire query (i.e. the one visited by the first iteration of this loop), or  b.
The check below will pick up this  case.
The check can be turned off for maximum performance, but the consequences of supplying an invalid string are then undefined.
The check expression
The check for little-endian architectures that tolerate unaligned memory accesses is just an optimization.
The checkProfileCallback(DB,P) macro checks to see if a profile callback is needed, and it invokes the callback if it is needed.
The checkpoint status information
The checksum is calculated by XORing the checksums of each individual entry (see fts3ChecksumEntry()) together.
The checksum is computed using 32-bit big-endian integers if the magic number in the first 4 bytes of the WAL is 0x377f0683 and it is computed using little-endian if the magic number is 0x377f0682.
The checksum is store in the first page of xShmMap memory as an 8-byte  blob starting at byte offset 40.
The checksum is wrong
The checksum values are always stored in the frame header in a big-endian format regardless of which byte order is used to compute the checksum.
The checksums for all entries in the index are XORed together to create a single checksum for the entire index.
The child select may contain expression trees of at most (SQLITE_MAX_EXPR_DEPTH-Parse.nHeight) height.
The child table to be scanned
The child1 and child2 terms were added by the LIKE optimization.
The choices are  SQLITE_MUTEX_OMIT         No mutex logic.
The chunks are cache aligned.
The chunks are kept on a linked list so that they can be deallocated when the RowSet is destroyed.
The circumstances under which SQLite will enforce the soft heap limit may changes in future releases of SQLite.
The cksum argument passed to this function is a checksum calculated based on all expected entries in the FTS index (including prefix index entries).
The class of our object is the same as the scope, and the private function (EX(fbc)) has the same scope.
The classes that have their own maps are: space, xdigit, digit, upper, lower, word, graph, print, punct, and cntrl.
The clause this term is part of
The client will de-serialize it into memory, and can iterate through the results via API.
The client will then send the XML to the server via external mechanism.
The client will use stmt_send_long_data
The client will use the library to build an in-memory representation of a request, and then serialize (encode) that request into XML.
The cnt parameter is the number of slots.
The co-routine is the common header to the 3rd and 4th templates.
The code above is the AFP lock implementation.
The code above is the NFS lock implementation.
The code below is actually not very nice, but I didn't see a better method
The code below is handling the return value of osFallocate()  correctly.
The code can also be used to build a tree via API then write out the tree to a buffer, thus "serializing" the xml.
The code can be up to 6 hex digits in length to allow surrogates to be specified.
The code does, however, check for an overrun.
The code for the "sqlite3" command-line shell is also in a separate file.
The code generated by this function scans through the rows in the child table that correspond to the parent table row being deleted or inserted.
The code generated follows one of four templates.
The code generated here is from the 4th template:  B: open temp table L: yield X, goto M at EOF insert row from R..R+n into temp table goto L M: ...
The code generator calls this routine if is discovers that it is possible to abort a statement prior to completion.
The code generator for compound SELECT statements does one level of recursion for each term.
The code generator maintains a stack of active WITH clauses with the inner-most WITH clause being at the top of the stack.
The code has been changed so that the workspace is expanded using malloc() in this situation.
The code in this file implements the function that runs the bytecode of a prepared statement.
The code in this file is only compiled if:  The FTS3 module is being built as an extension (in which case SQLITE_CORE is not defined), or  The FTS3 module is being built into the core of SQLite (in which case SQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3 is defined).
The code in this file is only used if we are compiling multithreaded on a Win32 system.
The code in this file is only used if we are compiling threadsafe under unix with pthreads.
The code in this file only exists if we are not omitting the ALTER TABLE logic from the build.
The code is a duplicate of a code in the last range, so just return.
The code is already generated.
The code is duplicated for the caseless and caseful cases, for speed, since matching characters is likely to be quite common.
The code is shared with single-character repeats by setting op_type to add a suitable offset into repeat_type.
The code is similar to that for character classes, but repeated for efficiency.
The code is similar to the above, without the capturing complication.
The code is specific to MacOSX and does not work on other unix platforms.
The code is written so that the hard lower-limit for each of these values  is 1.
The code is written this way for performance, to avoid having to run the interrupt and progress checks on every opcode.
The code later relies on this.
The code requires a 32-bit integer type, though.
The code should be inserted somewhere before the last range in the list.
The code starts after the real_pcre block and the capture name table.
The code that calls this routine will use that memory range to store keys for start and termination conditions of the loop.
The code that follows * shows first how to access named substrings, and then how to code for    * repeated matches on the same subject.
The code that sqlite3WhereBegin() generates leaves the cursors named in pTabList pointing at their appropriate entries.
The code to actually verify the schema cookie will occur at the end of the top-level VDBE and will be generated later, by sqlite3FinishCoding().
The code to implement this API is not available in the public release of SQLite.
The code to make the lock occur is generated by a later call to codeTableLocks() which occurs during sqlite3FinishCoding().
The code variable is pointing at the byte into which the BRA operator has been stored.
The code within this loop is run only once if the 'searchList' variable is not true.
The collating function must return an integer that is negative, zero, or positive if the first string is less than, equal to, or greater than the second, respectively.
The collating sequence for the compound select is taken from the left-most term of the select that has a collating sequence.
The collating sequence might be determined by a COLLATE operator or by the presence of a column with a defined collating sequence.
The collation sequence must be defined at this point, even if the user deletes the collation sequence after the vdbe program is compiled (this was not always the case).
The collation sequence used by the comparison.
The collation sequence used for the comparison should be that of the parent key columns.
The collation sequences of the comparison and select-list expressions must match those of the index.
The collector should only be called by the master.
The collision detection logic below can all be skipped.
The column affinity string will eventually be deleted by sqliteDeleteIndex() when the Index structure itself is cleaned up.
The column containing the blob
The column list has only names, not types or collations.
The column list presumably came from selectColumnNamesFromExprList().
The column names of the new table will match the result set of the SELECT.
The column of the index to be loaded
The column on the LHS of the term.
The column on the left-hand side of the MATCH operator is column number idxNum-FTS3_FULLTEXT_SEARCH, 0 indexed.
The column that is wanted
The column the token must match
The column value supplied by SQLite must be in range.
The column-list is terminated either by a POS_COLUMN varint (1) or a POS_END varint (0).
The columns of the result set
The columns of the returned data set are:  cid:        Column id (numbered from left to right, starting at 0) name:       Column name type:       Column declaration type.
The columns to change in the UPDATE statement
The combined READER/HANDLER
The commands implemented by this function are documented in the "Special INSERT Directives" section of the documentation.
The comments within this routine usually assume glob matching.
The commit and rollback hook callbacks are not reentrant.
The commit flag.
The commit has already been done.
The common case
The common case is for a varint to be a single byte.
The common case is that no cursors need to be saved, so this routine is broken out from its caller to avoid unnecessary stack pointer movement.
The comparison is a sort comparison, so NULLs compare equal, NULLs are less than numbers, numbers are less than strings, and strings are less than blobs.
The comparison of the keys is performed by a user supplied function.
The comparison opcode
The comparison was done above.
The compiled version of the regular expression can be stored as metadata associated with the pattern string.
The compiler is not-reentrant.

The constant is also hardcoded in cmd/ld/pe.c (keep synchronized).
The constant is also the initializer for the run-time allocated buffer.
The constant may resolve to NULL
The constraint to test
The content being read or written might appear on the main page or be scattered out on multiple overflow pages.
The content is the same sequence of bytes, it is merely interpreted as a BLOB instead of a string, as if it had been CAST.
The content of a cell looks like this:  SIZE    DESCRIPTION 4     Page number of the left child.
The content of a leaf page is unspecified.
The content of each node is formatted as follows:  1.
The content of that one row is the content of memory register P2.
The content of the page
The content of the whole page
The content of this file is only used if SQLITE_SYSTEM_MALLOC is defined.
The content of this structure must not change while it is registered with any database connection.
The content to returned is determined by the parameter J which is one of the STAT_GET_xxxx values defined above.

The contents of the pending-terms hash-table have already been flushed into the database by fts5SyncMethod().
The contents of this array are generated by parsing the CaseFolding.txt file distributed as part of the "Unicode Character Database".
The context and API objects  passed to the callback function may be used to access the properties of each matched row.
The context consists of a list of tables (the pSrcList) field and a list of named expression (pEList).
The context function, used when tracing back C calls into Go.
The contiguous array of leaf nodes starts at the first block allocated.
The controlling WhereLoop object
The conversion algorithms are implemented based on descriptions in the following text:  Jean Meeus Astronomical Algorithms, 2nd Edition, 1998 ISBM 0-943396-61-1 Willmann-Bell, Inc Richmond, Virginia (USA)
The conversion is done in-place.
The cookie changes its value whenever the database schema changes.
The cookie mask contains one bit for each database file open.
The copies can be deleted (by being passed to their respective ...Delete() routines) without effecting the originals.
The copy of the Table structure is deleted by tokenize.c  after parsing is finished.
The copy operation of step (3) requires additional temporary disk space approximately equal to the size of the original database for the rollback journal.
The core must call OsFileControl() though, not OsFileControlHint(), as if a custom VFS (e.g. zipvfs) returns an error here, it probably means the commit really has failed and an error should be returned to the user.
The core of the MD5 algorithm, this alters an existing MD5 hash to reflect the addition of 16 longwords of new data.
The correct "ANSI" way to do this is to use the intptr_t type.
The correct SQL-92 behavior is for the LIKE operator to ignore case.
The correct URI for that UNC has only two or four leading / characters file://host/path or file:////host/path.
The cost of DESTROY is O(N).
The cost of a TEST using the same batch number is O(logN).
The cost of an INSERT is roughly constant.
The cost of the first SMALLEST is O(NlogN).
The cost of visiting the index rows is N*K, where K is between 1.1 and 3.0, depending on the relative sizes of the index and table rows.
The count is already in characters, but we need to skip over a multibyte character in UTF8 mode.
The count part of the header will be the total number of codes that have numbers.
The counter is set to zero each time a  database transaction is opened.
The coverage testing points are line numbers in the sqlite3.c source file.
The createFlags should be 0 to check for existing pages and should be 3 (not 1, but 3) to try to create a new page.
The cross dimension is the max of the elements dimension since there can only be one element in that cross dimension.
The crypt_blowfish homepage is:  http://www.openwall.com/crypt/  This code comes from John the Ripper password cracker, with reentrant and crypt(3) interfaces added, but optimizations specific to password cracking removed.

The current term of the first nMerge entries in the array of Fts3SegReader objects is the same.
The current thread will continue to use this snapshot.
The current token did not end with e.g. a "."
The current token is no valid hexadecimal digit
The current value for the constraint is left in register iReg.
The current values for a and b will be stored in consecutive registers and the index of the first register is returned.
The currently executing frame is stored in Vdbe.pFrame.
The cursor "p" has a pending seek operation that has not yet been carried out.
The cursor can be either for reading or writing.
The cursor can seek to a BTree entry with a particular key, or loop over all entries of the Btree.
The cursor for a virtual table
The cursor for the object that contains the complete data (normally the table itself, but the PRIMARY KEY index in the case of a WITHOUT ROWID table) is returned in *piDataCur.
The cursor is always opened read/write even if  the main database is read-only.
The cursor is left open after returning.
The cursor is left pointing at a random location.
The cursor is used only to define what table the record should be inserted into.
The cursor might point to an entry that comes before or after the key.

The data might change or move the next time any btree routine is called.
The data of the new record
The data or key is taken from the entry that pCur is currently pointing to.
The data should be allocated with malloc()
The data structures are corrupt.
The data that follows the key is in a similar, but not identical format to the doclist data stored in the database.
The data variable is saved across frames, so the byte map needs to be stored there.
The data was obtained from /dev/random.
The database
The database being initialized

The database we are looking in
The datatype of the return value is BLOB, but it is really just a pointer to the Stat4Accum object.
The datatype used to store estimates of the number of rows in a table or index.
The datatype ynVar is a signed integer, either 16-bit or 32-bit.
The dates and times are stored as the number of days since noon in Greenwich on November 24, 4714 B.C.
The db parameter is optional.
The db pointer is used as a memory context for any subsequent allocations that need to occur.
The dbOrigSize and dbFileSize variables may not be trusted at this point.
The dbSize variable may be trusted (even if a user-level read  transaction is not active).
The dbSize, dbOrigSize and dbFileSize variables are all valid.
The dbSize, dbOrigSize and dbFileSize variables may not be trusted.
The dbstat virtual table is used to extract low-level formatting information from an SQLite database in order to implement the "sqlite3_analyzer" utility.
The deQuote parameter is ignored if pToken is NULL or if the token does not appear to be quoted.
The debugger uses a task-level exception handler to intercept signals.
The decimal point
The declaration type for a ROWID field is INTEGER.
The declaration type is the exact datatype definition extracted from the original CREATE TABLE statement if the expression is a column.
The default MMAP_SIZE is zero on all platforms.
The default SQLite sqlite3_vfs implementations do not allocate memory (actually, os_unix.c allocates a small amount of memory from within OsOpen()), but some third-party implementations may.
The default collating sequence (BINARY)
The default configuration is limited to 512 stdio files
The default configuration is recommended for most applications and so this routine is usually not necessary.
The default configuration is to use memory allocation routines in this file.
The default implementation uses Posix Advisory Locks.
The default initial allocation for the pagecache when using separate pagecaches for each database connection.
The default is -1.
The default is 64 bits, hence SQLite is only able to process joins with 64 or fewer tables.
The default is NULL.
The default is SQLITE_DEFAULT_FILE_PERMISSIONS (normally 0644) as modified by the system umask.
The default is to limit the maximum cell size so that at least 4 cells will fit on one page.
The default location of PENDING_BYTE is the first byte past the 1GB boundary.
The default number of frames to accumulate in the log file before checkpointing the database in WAL mode.
The default page size and offset
The default page size is the maximum of:  + SQLITE_DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE, + The value returned by sqlite3OsSectorSize() + The largest page size that can be written atomically.
The default relocation type for this operand.
The default setting of the auth function is NULL.
The default size of a database page.

The default socket location is sometimes defined by configure.
The default strategy is to create an ephemeral table that contains for each row to be changed:  (A)  The original rowid of that row.
The default value for the auto-vacuum property is  determined by the SQLITE_DEFAULT_AUTOVACUUM macro.
The default value for the second argument to matchinfo().
The default value is PDO_PARAM_STR
The default value is either the integer 0, the floating point number 0.0, or a NULL pointer.
The default value is the full path to the archive.
The default value may be changed by compiling with the SQLITE_USE_URI symbol defined.
The default value of a column is specified by a DEFAULT clause in the  column definition.
The default xmlrpc vocab (xml_to_xmlrpc.c), and simple-rpc (xml_to_dandarpc.c) which is proprietary, but imho more readable, and nice for proprietary legacy reasons.
The definition of "at or after" depends on whether this iterator iterates in ascending or descending rowid order.
The definition of the module
The definition of this CTE
The delay increases linearly with each retry.
The delta string should be null-terminated.

The descriptor will be initialized in a thread, so we have to give a chance to get opened.
The deserialized value is returned.
The desired encoding for the collating sequence
The destination copy of iPage needs to be updated with the new data before the backup operation is complete.
The destination database handle is not locked in this routine, but it is locked in sqlite3_backup_step().
The destination object is made permanent so that multiple JPEG images can be written to the same file without re-executing jpeg_stdio_dest.
The destructor
The destructor X in  sqlite3_set_auxdata(C,N,P,X) might be called immediately, before the sqlite3_set_auxdata() interface even returns.
The details are unknown, but the lengths of the months were adjusted until they finally stablized in 8 A.D.
The details of the operation codes, their meanings, the parameters they take, and what they do are all subject to change without notice.
The difference between VSPACE and ANYNL is that the latter can match the two-character CRLF sequence, but that is not relevant for finding the first character, so their code here is identical.
The difference between the Julian and today's Gregorian calendar is that the Gregorian does not make centennial years leap years unless they are a multiple of 400, which leads to a year of 365.2425 days.
The difference between this function and pager_write() is that this function also deals with the special case where 2 or more pages fit on a single disk sector.
The difference between this function and sqlite3VdbeDelete() is that VdbeDelete() also unlinks the Vdbe from the list of VMs associated with the database connection and frees the object itself.
The difference between this routine and sqlite3PagerGet() is that _get() will go to the disk and read in the page if the page is not already in cache.
The difference is important when using a pointer to the function.
The difference is only important to the update hook.
The difference is that if a malloc() fails in sqlite3_create_function(), an error code is returned and the mallocFailed flag cleared.
The differences are in the way that file locking is done.
The differences between the new and the old syntaxes are:  a) The new syntax supports parenthesis.
The different query plans.
The different uses might require different sized allocations.
The dimensions can never be smaller than the padding and border
The direct assignment in the previous line is possible only because the WO_ and SQLITE_INDEX_CONSTRAINT_ codes are identical.
The directory file descriptor is used for only one thing - to fsync() a directory to make sure file creation and deletion events are flushed to disk.
The dirent struct is compatible with Unix, except that d_ino is always 1 and d_off is made up as we go along.
The dist tool enables this by build flag when testing.
The distinctive characteristic of this sqlite3_file is that the actual on disk file is created lazily.
The diurnal arc, hours
The divider cell consists of a 4-byte page number (the page number of pPage) and a variable length key value (which must be the same value as the largest key on pPage).
The divider cells have already been removed from pParent.
The doNotSpill NOSYNC bit is set during times when doing a sync of journal (and adding a new header) is not allowed.
The doNotSpill ROLLBACK and OFF bits inhibits all cache spilling regardless of whether or not a sync is required.
The doc states it'll be always true, however it theoretically could be FALSE when the thread was signaled.
The docid to be deleted
The doclist may or may not finish within the buffer.
The doclists must be merged and a single term returned with the merged doclist.
The documentation for connect() says in case of non-blocking connections the select function reports success in the writefds set and failure in the exceptfds set.
The double-precision datatype used by RTree depends on the SQLITE_RTREE_INT_ONLY compile-time option.
The dummy will be overwritten later.
The dupedExpr*Size() routines each return the number of bytes required to store a copy of an expression or expression tree.
The duplicates that this creates do not  cause any problems.
The eMode parameter is always valid
The eOp argument is interpreted as follows:  0: The operation is a read.
The eStmt parameter passed to this function must match that passed to the sqlite3Fts5StorageStmt() call.
The early check means that subsequent code can assume it is dealing with a valid string.
The easiest way to enforce this limit is to consider only records with 13 fields or less.
The element that matches key
The element that matches key (if any)
The element to be inserted
The element to be removed from the pH
The element we are about to add would make us go to the next line

The encoding is given by enc.
The end of a position list is marked by a zero encoded as an FTS3  varint.
The end of each child journal file is marked with a  nul-terminator byte (0x00).
The end of these brackets will always be OP_KETRPOS, which returns MATCH_KETRPOS without going further in the pattern.
The endian- specific implementations are much faster and are preferred if the processor endianness is known at compile-time.

The entry point is zProc.
The enum value for this mnemonic.
The environment variable doesn't exist.
The ephemeral database might be exclusively in memory, or it might use a disk-based memory cache.

The four core functions - F1 is optimized somewhat
The fourth optional argument is whatever the user wants (and specified in the grammar) and is available for use by the action routines.
The fractional seconds FFFF can be one or more digits.
The fractional seconds extension (the ".FFF") is optional.
The frame-header is six big-endian 32-bit unsigned  integer values, as follows:  0: Page number.
The fsync() system call does not work as advertised on many unix systems.
The fts3 built-in tokenizers - "simple", "porter" and "icu"- are  implemented in files fts3_tokenizer1.c, fts3_porter.c and fts3_icu.c respectively.
The fts3 module calls this  method exactly once for each successful call to xOpen().
The fts3 module calls this method exactly once for each successful call to xCreate().
The fts3BestSnippet() function often selects snippets that end with a query term.
The fts3EofMethod() will be called subsequently to determine whether or not an EOF was hit.
The fts5EofMethod() will be called subsequently to determine whether or not an EOF was hit.
The fts5_expr.c API above this point is used by the other hand-written C code in this module.
The fts5yyzerominor constant is used to initialize instances of fts5YYMINORTYPE objects to zero.
The full division routine.
The full list of Unicode newline characters is taken from http://unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr18/.
The full-path is written to this buffer before returning.
The full-text index is stored in a series of b+tree (-like) structures called segments which map terms to doclists.
The full_read argument tells whether characters above max are accepted or not.
The function blobGrowBuffer() is used to extend the allocation.
The function calling context
The function definition object
The function definition to insert
The function exists purely for its side-effects.
The function for reporting virtual-machine related events to VTune.
The function has P5 arguments.
The function is global in the C sense so that it can be called from pcre_study() when finding the minimum matching length.
The function name
The function name.

The function will return a unique method ID, the user should maintain the ID for each method
The functionality of sqlite_stat3 is a superset of sqlite_stat2.
The functions querySharedCacheTableLock(), setSharedCacheTableLock(), and clearAllSharedCacheTableLocks() manipulate entries in the BtShared.pLock linked list used to store shared-cache table level locks.
The functions used by the UPDATE/DELETE generation code to query for this information are:  sqlite3FkRequired() - Test to see if FK processing is required.
The general concept of this implementation is to keep track of all alloca-allocated blocks, and reclaim any that are found to be deeper in the stack than the current invocation.
The general operand (not immediate).
The general version.
The generated code will increase the file format number if necessary.
The generated file, cmplxdivide1.go, is compiled along with the driver cmplxdivide.go (the names are confusing and unimaginative) to run the actual test.
The generator is already closed, thus can't resume
The generator is already closed, thus can't send anything
The generator object is stored in EX(return_value)
The generic sqlite3_tokenizer.pModule variable should not be initialized by this callback.
The getput_arg_fast should handle this otherwise.
The glob pattern
The global PGroup for mode (2)
The global mutex is used to protect the unixInodeInfo and vxworksFileId objects used by this file, all of which may be  shared by multiple threads.
The global mutex is used to protect the winLockInfo objects used by this file, all of which may be shared by multiple threads.
The global stats are those elements  of the matchinfo array that are constant for all rows returned by the  current query.
The gmp_*_op functions provide an implementation for several common types of GMP functions.
The goal of these settings is to pack together groups of small doclists while making it efficient to directly access large doclists.
The group by clause
The group mutex must be released before pcache1Alloc() is called.
The group the new page cache will belong to
The handle may be closed by calling the sqlite3Fts3SegmentsClose() function.
The handle to our heap.
The handling of escape sequences consisting of a string of digits starting with one that is not zero is not straightforward.
The hasHeldSharedLock flag prevents this from occurring on the very first access to a file, in order to save a single unnecessary sqlite3OsRead() call at the start-up.
The has_property check is first performed in "exists" mode (which returns true for properties that are null but exist) and then in "has" mode to handle objects that implement __isset (which is not called in "exists" mode).
The hash for this key has already been computed and is passed as the 4th parameter.
The hash for this key is also computed and returned in the *pH parameter.
The hash for this key.
The hash function
The hash table consists of HASHTABLE_NSLOT 16-bit unsigned integers.
The hash table into which to insert
The hash table is cleared before returning.
The hash table might fail  to resize if sqliteMalloc() fails.
The hash table might fail to resize if sqlite3_malloc() fails or if the new size is the same as the prior size.
The hash table must been initialized to use string keys, and to take a private copy  of the key when a value is inserted.
The hash table to insert into
The hashing function.
The hashtable containing the shared values.
The hdr-size field is also a varint which is the offset from the beginning of the record to data0.
The head also contains pointers to three user defined functions: - a function to test if a cached userdata matches some keydata - a function to provide a new userdata struct to the cache if there has been a cache miss.
The head structure has a pointer to the most-recently-used element, and elements are moved to this position in the list each time they are used.
The header is this many bytes in size.
The header must be exactly 16 bytes including the zero-terminator so the string itself should be 15 characters long.
The header string that appears at the beginning of every SQLite database.
The header was successfully read.
The heap property is this:  Every node is less than or equal to both of its daughter nodes.
The hello method is not inherited by SSL structs when assigning a new context inside the SNI callback, so the just use SSLv23
The heuristic is that double-quoting is unnecessary unless the string contains an apostrophe, a comma, or backslash (other than backslash-backslash).
The hex() function.
The high-order bit is set if any column after the 64th is used.
The higher bits represent the key, the lower ones the value.
The highest number for a valid UTF-8 first byte is in fact 0x3d.
The highwater mark is adjusted if necessary.
The highwater mark is meaningless and is returned as zero.
The highwater mark is unchanged.
The i-th cell pointer
The i-th index expression
The iCol-th column of the result set
The iDefaultCol parameter should be passed the index of the table column that appears on the left-hand-side of the MATCH operator (the default column to match against for tokens for which a column name is not explicitly specified as part of the query string), or -1 if tokens may by default match any table column.
The iDistinct table keeps a copy of all rows that have ever been inserted into Queue and causes duplicates to be discarded.
The iIdxCur parameter is the cursor number of an index.
The iLimit register is initialized to LIMIT.
The iOffset register (if it exists) is initialized to the value of the OFFSET.
The iParent cursor will never be used.
The iPg value in the following loop starts at nNew-1 goes down to 0, then back up to nNew-1 again, thus making two passes over the pages.
The iPos argument is ignored for a delete.
The iVersion value will increment whenever this happens.
The id is always a node-id.
The idea behind dataOnly is that it should only write the file content to disk, not the inode.
The idea is that a test program (like the SQL Logic Test or SLT test module) can run the same SQL multiple times with various optimizations disabled to verify that the same answer is obtained in every case.
The idea is that if the atomic-write optimization is not enabled at compile time, the compiler can omit the tests of 'isDirect' below, as well as the block enclosed in the "if( isDirect )" condition.
The idea is that this function works like a combination of GetLastError() and FormatMessage() on Windows (or errno and strerror_r() on Unix).
The idx column names the index and the tbl column is the table of the index.
The idx of the new segment is always 0.
The immediate operand must be 32 bit.
The impersonation token is not actually assigned to the thread, but is used in the call to AccessCheck.
The implementation is not required to provide versions of these routines that actually work.
The implementation is stolen from array_data_shuffle
The implementation of an SQLite user-defined-function that accepts a single integer as an argument.
The implementation of dupedExprStructSize() contain multiple assert() statements that attempt to enforce this constraint.
The implementation of the rbu_target_name() SQL function.
The implementation of the sqlite_record() function.
The implementation of this method is expected to release all outstanding resources obtained by the mutex methods implementation, especially those obtained by the xMutexInit method.
The implementation of this routine was generated by a program, mkkeywordhash.h, located in the tool subdirectory of the distribution.
The implementation of user-defined scalar function fts5_decode().
The implementation of user-defined scalar function fts5_rowid().
The implementation plan is to implement the two coroutines and seven subroutines first, then put the control logic at the bottom.
The implementations of the methods defined by this structure are not required to handle this case, the results of passing a NULL pointer instead of a valid mutex handle are undefined (i.e. it is acceptable to provide an implementation that segfaults if it is passed a NULL pointer).
The implicit assumption here is that if fstat() fails, things are in such bad shape that dropping a lock or two doesn't matter much.
The imposter table has the  same schema as the actual target table (less any UNIQUE constraints).
The in-memory image of a disk page has the auxiliary information appended to the end.
The inFlags parameter must contain exactly one of the bits IN_INDEX_MEMBERSHIP or IN_INDEX_LOOP.
The inability to allocates space for a larger hash table is a performance hit but it is not a fatal error.
The inability to get a read lock indicates that some other database connection is holding a write-lock, which in turn means that the other connection has made uncommitted changes to the schema.
The inconsistency  is unfortunate but cannot be changed without breaking backwards  compatibility.
The increment is used to increase the schema cookie so that other connections to the same database will know to reread the schema.
The incremental merge did not copy all the data from this  segment to the upper level.
The index (1-based) of the term out of range
The index associated with pLoop
The index being used for this loop
The index can not be larger than ZIP_INT64_MAX since the size of the central directory cannot be larger than ZIP_UINT64_MAX, and each entry is larger than 2 bytes.
The index created will become the PRIMARY KEY index.
The index cursors might not be used, but if they are used they need to occur right after the database cursor.
The index entry must begin with a header size
The index for which to generate a key
The index is identified by the "idx" column and the "tbl" column is the name of the table to which the index belongs.
The index is itself UNIQUE, and  2.

The indices for graph, print, and punct are needed, so identify them.
The individual item types that can be repeated set these backoff variables appropriately.
The inet type holds an IPv4 or IPv6 host address, and optionally its subnet, all in one field.
The information where a class is declared is only available for user classes
The information where a function is declared is only available for user classes
The initial *pRes value will be 1 if the cursor being stepped corresponds to an SQL index and if this routine could have been skipped if that SQL index had been a unique index.
The initial batch number is zero, so if the very first TEST contains a non-zero batch number, it will see all prior INSERTs.
The initial code size
The initial database size

The inner query or "subquery"
The inode of fd
The input is an array of integers that acts as a program to test the Bitvec.
The input lists are connected via pRight pointers and are  assumed to each already be in sorted order.
The input string A
The input string must be zero-terminated.
The input text that generated the token is identified by the byte offsets returned in *piStartOffset and piEndOffset.
The input to this routine is an WhereTerm structure with only the "pExpr" field filled in.
The input value in P3 might be of any type: integer, real, string, blob, or NULL.
The input word *pz and zFrom are both in reverse order.
The input word is copied into the output with US-ASCII case folding.
The input, pIn, is a binary tree (or subtree) of RowSetEntry objects.
The instruction includes the AL condition.
The instruction is recorded as an instance of the following structure:
The integer ROWID or key for the record to be inserted
The integer consists of all bytes that have bit 8 set and the first byte with bit 8 clear.
The integer just read is a column number.
The integer parser token codes are reused as opcodes here.
The integer query plan parameter to xFilter is stored in register P3.
The integer range is limited by the machine's int representation.
The integer returned is an SQLITE_ success/failure code that describes the result of executing the virtual machine.
The integer value pointed to by pnChange is incremented by the number of entries in the table.
The integer values
The integers are opcodes followed by 0, 1, or 3 operands, depending on the opcode.
The integration uses  ICU to provide the following to SQLite:  An implementation of the SQL regexp() function (and hence REGEXP operator) using the ICU uregex_XX() APIs.
The integrity of the database is maintained by a (possibly synchronous) transaction opened on the main database before sqlite3BtreeCopyFile() is called.
The integrity of the transaction is already guaranteed, but some stray 'cold' journals may be lying around.
The integrity-check code calculates the same checksum in two ways:  1.
The integrity-check works as follows.
The intent of the integer argument is to let the fault simulator know which of multiple sqlite3FaultSim() calls has been hit.
The intent was to create a new calendar system that was based on scientific principals, not religious traditions.
The interface is modeled after MySQL JSON functions:  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/json.html  For the time being, all JSON is stored as pure text.
The interface is the same as sqlite3VdbeExec().
The interface might change in incompatible ways.
The interface to the LEMON-generated parser
The interface to the code in fault.c used for identifying "benign" malloc failures.
The interface to the virtual-table mechanism defined above (back up to a comment remarkably similar to this one) is currently considered to be experimental.
The interface to the virtual-table mechanism is currently considered to be experimental.
The interface used by the implementation of the aforementioned functions to retrieve the collation sequence set by this opcode is not available publicly.
The interfaces above must be called in a particular order.
The interfaces below this point are called by the parser code in fts5parse.y.
The interfaces in this file is only available when compiling with SQLITE_DEBUG.
The interior nodes at a given height are naturally tracked by interior nodes at height+1, and so on.
The interior of the tree is assembled in memory and written out only once all leaves have been populated and stored.
The internal __COMPILER_HALT_OFFSET__ is prefixed by NULL byte
The internal databases can be given the large, default limits.
The internal details of this type are only accessed by the following functions:  fts3SegWriterAdd() fts3SegWriterFlush() fts3SegWriterFree()
The internals of this structure are intended to be opaque -- client code should not attempt to access or modify the fields of this structure directly.
The internals of this structure are only accessed by:  walIteratorInit() - Create a new iterator, walIteratorNext() - Step an iterator, walIteratorFree() - Free an iterator.
The interpretation of the P4 string is left to the module implementation.
The intersection finding technique of this code could be improved by remembering the previous intertersection, and by using the slope.
The intkey flag means that the key is an integer which is stored in the key size entry of the cell header rather than in the payload area.
The is done to support legacy SQL code.
The isDeferred parameter is 1 for INITIALLY DEFERRED and 0 for INITIALLY IMMEDIATE.
The isDirectMode flag may only be non-zero if the library was compiled with the SQLITE_ENABLE_ATOMIC_WRITE macro defined.
The isHot parameter indicates that we are trying to rollback a journal that might be a hot journal.
The isRequirePhrase variable is set to true if a phrase or an expression contained in parenthesis is required.
The isTemp flag is true if the table should be stored in the auxiliary database file instead of in the main database file.
The iterator currently points to a table (not index) of type  RBU_PK_WITHOUT_ROWID.
The iterator initially points to the first term/rowid entry in the  iterated data.
The iterator is in an unusual state when this function is called: the Fts5SegIter.iLeafOffset variable is set to the offset of the start of the position-list size field for the first relevant rowid on the page.
The iterator is left pointing to the first entry when  this function returns.
The iterator key should be the path that the file will have within the phar archive.
The iterator must return a series of strings that are full paths to files that should be added to the phar.
The iterator object passed as the second argument currently contains no valid values except for the Fts5SegIter.pLeaf member variable.
The iterator passed as the first argument has the following fields set as follows.
The iterator passed as the second argument is guaranteed to point to a table (not an index) when this function is called.
The iterator to advance by one position
The job of this function is to make pPg clean by writing its contents out to the database file, if possible.
The job of this routine is to analyze the subexpression and populate all the other fields of the WhereTerm structure.
The job of this routine is to convert both internal schema data structures and the generated VDBE code so that they are appropriate for a WITHOUT ROWID table instead of a rowid table.
The job of this routine is to find or create a b-tree object that can be used either to test for membership in the RHS set or to iterate through all members of the RHS set, skipping duplicates.
The join operator is held in the entry to the left.
The jointype starts out showing the join type between the current table and the next table on the list.
The journal file does not need to be synced following this operation.
The journal file exists and no other connection has a reserved or greater lock on the database file.
The journal file format is as follows:   (1)  8 byte prefix.
The journal file from which to read
The journal file into which to write
The journal file is open and the first header has been written  and synced to disk.
The journal file is open and the first header has been written  to it, but the header has not been synced to disk.
The journal file is then deleted and SQLITE_OK returned, just as if no corruption had been encountered.
The journal file may or may not be open at this point.
The journal file may or may not be open.
The journal file must be open when this function is called.
The journal file must be open when this is called.
The journal file must be open when this routine is called.
The journal file needs to be opened.
The journal file still exists in the file-system  though, and if a failure occurs at this point it will eventually be used as a hot-journal and the current transaction rolled back.
The journal header size for this pager.
The json_each virtual table
The json_parse(JSON) function returns a string which describes a parse of the JSON provided.
The json_test1(JSON) function return true (1) if the input is JSON text generated by another json function.
The julian day number times 86400000
The jump is taken if the SQLITE_JUMPIFNULL bit is set.
The justification for duplicating code is that according to  callgrind, this causes a certain test case to hit the CPU 4.7  percent less (x86 linux, gcc version 4.1.2, -O6) than if  sqlite3MemRelease() were called from here.
The kernel offers thread handlers a chance to resolve exceptions before the task handler, so we can generate the panic and avoid lldb's SIGSEGV handler.
The key (zTerm/nTerm) is guaranteed to be greater than the largest key on the node just written, but smaller than or equal to the first key that will be written to the next leaf node.
The key MUST be present.
The key and data for any entry are combined to form the "payload".
The key for INTKEY tables, or nPayload otherwise
The key is copied onto the P2 register exactly as  it is found in the database file.
The key is generated using MD5, but we only use the first 8 bytes because it allows us to use atomic operations.
The key is given by (pKey,nKey) and the data is given by (pData,nData).
The key is not copied in this instance.
The key is pKey and the data is "data".
The key is pKey,nKey and the data is "data".
The key is stored in register P3.
The key must be a MEM_Int.
The key numbers start at 0x100, and we expect to be one of the early calls to pthread_key_create, so we should be able to get a pretty low number.
The key of the new record
The key we are searching for
The key will be incremented on first use, so it'll start at 0
The key will be written into the parent of this node.
The key with be for index pIdx which is an index on pTab.
The key/data may move or be destroyed on the next call to any Btree routine, including calls from other threads against the same cache.
The keys of the PHP hash MUST be numeric.
The label can be used as the P2 value of an operation.
The label could point the address after the constant pool.
The label should be resolved using sqlite3ResolvePartIdxLabel().
The largest amount I've seen used is 218, so this number is very generous.
The largest iLevel value in the tree
The last argument should be the image.
The last buffer content is sent to next buffer
The last capture is a local variable even for recursions.
The last column is NULL to indicate the end of the row.
The last column is the record as a blob.
The last field of the index should be an integer - the ROWID.
The last four columns apply to items that cannot be repeated, so there is no need to have rows for them.
The last index block in a wal-index usually contains less than the full complement of HASHTABLE_NPAGE (or HASHTABLE_NPAGE_ONE) page-numbers, depending on the contents of the WAL file.
The last is always set to 1, as once the trailing PK fields are considered all index keys are unique.
The last item *must* be 0.
The last multiplication could overflow.
The last multiplication could underflow.
The last packet will have 'eof' set If PS, then no result set follows.
The last page can have as little as 1 byte of data.
The last part is the salt string.
The last prior entry
The last rowid in the doclist may not be on the current page.
The last statement or normal query result will close it then.
The last thing the sqlite3_prepare() function does is copy the error stored by this function into the database handle using sqlite3Error().
The last token parsed
The latter case was added in 3.7.1 when support for 64K pages was added.
The latter hasn't been moved
The latter is important for XHTML.
The latter is needed because for certain multiple inputs to the buggy algorithm there exist easily found inputs to the correct algorithm that produce the same hash.
The layout of divisions is as follows:  General-purpose declarations and utility functions.
The leaf flag means that this page has no children.
The least significant 10 bits are used to store the size of the range (always at least 1).
The least significant bit is bit 1.
The left most table is the first entry in Select.pSrc.
The left operand
The left part of the FROM clause already seen
The left query could also be a compound query in which case this routine will be called recursively.
The left siblings are always nearly full, while the right-most sibling might be nearly empty.
The left-hand (repeated) opcode is used to select the row, and the right-hand opcode is use to select the column.
The left-hand (repeated) opcode is used to select the row, and the right-hand opcode is used to select the column.
The left-most column is 1.
The left-most leaf is the one with the smallest key - the first in ascending order.
The leftmost coordinate column is 'a', the second from the left 'b' etc.
The length in the table is a minimum, so we have to arrange to skip the extra bytes.
The length in the terminating ket is always the length of the whole bracketed item.
The length is cached so we don't need to ask Oracle every time
The length of data write will be between 1 and 9 bytes.
The length of data written will be between 1 and FTS3_VARINT_MAX bytes.
The length of the serialized data for the column
The level of the FROM clause we are working on
The level of the new segment is equal to the numerically greatest segment level currently present in the database for this index.
The limit is not changed if the value originally pointed to is negative, and so the current limit  can be queried by passing in a pointer to a negative number.
The limit is now strictly enforced at all times.
The linker sets this automatically on iOS 8+,  but we deploy to iOS 7.
The list is being searched and this trunk page is the page to allocate, regardless of whether it has leaves.
The list is connected by Trigger.pNext pointers.
The list is kept in ascending order by pBt address.
The list must be in order.
The list of Btrees connected by pNext and pPrev should be in sorted order by Btree.pBt value.
The list of all parents for child Table X is held at X.pFKey.
The list of all registered VFS implementations.
The list of expressions
The list of freeblocks must be in ascending order.
The list of integers in the stat column can optionally be followed by the keyword "unordered".
The list of lengths is terminated by a zero length entry.
The list of pages passed into this routine is always sorted by page number.
The loaded doclist does not take deferred tokens into account.
The loading of large blobs can be skipped for length() and all content loading can be skipped for typeof().
The local stats are those elements of the  array that are different for each row returned by the query.
The local value of Pager.sectorSize is restored at the end of that routine.
The local variables YYSIZE and YYSTACKSIZE give the old and new number of elements in the stack, and YYPTR gives the new location of the stack.
The local_size is already adjusted by the saved registers.
The location of the column value is returned.
The location to move pDbPage to
The lock byte is obtained at  random so two separate readers can probably access the file at the  same time, unless they are unlucky and choose the same lock byte.
The lock is  described by pLock.
The lock is a write lock if isWritelock is true or a read lock if it is false.
The lock is held if and only if the lockfile exists
The lock-related methods of the proxy-locking sqlite3_io_method object follow.
The locking context for the proxy lock
The locking methods were defined in divisions above (one locking method per division).
The locking might fail on one of the later transitions leaving the lock state different from what it started but still short of its goal.
The locking structure keeps a reference count (so we will know when to delete it) and a "cnt" field that tells us its internal lock status.
The log message is stored in a fixed-length buffer on the stack.
The logic is that a recursion can only make sense if there is another alternation that stops the recursing.
The longest anonymous name
The longest property name we use in an uploaded file array
The longest run of digits wins.
The longest string dtoa can return is about 751 bytes long.

The lookahead symbol.
The lookup key
The loop below pulls entries from the min-heap in order and compares the start_address against the previous end_address.
The loop below will correct for any error in this estimate.
The loop is required here in case the sector-size is larger than the  database page size.
The loop that calls php_random_bytes should be terminated by the exception instead of proceeding to demand more entropy.
The loop that contains the LIKE operator
The loop to adjust downward
The low 8 bit must be zero.
The lower 16-bits of the sqlite3_index_info.idxNum value set by the xBestIndex() method contains the Fts3Cursor.eSearch value described above.
The lower level vfs will do the special RBU handling.
The lowest is 0xc2, but we overkill by starting at 0xc0 (192) for simplicity.
The lowest nibble contains the phar wide flags.
The m parameter will be non-zero only when creating -wal, -journal, and -shm files.
The macro MEMDB is true if we are dealing with an in-memory database.
The macro USEFETCH is true if we are allowed to use the xFetch and xUnfetch interfaces to access the database using memory-mapped I/O.
The macro unlikely() is a hint that surrounds a boolean expression that is usually false.

The makefile for SQLite generates two C files "opcodes.h" and "opcodes.c" by scanning this file looking for lines that begin with "case OP_".
The makefile makes some minor changes to this file (such as inserting the version number) and changes its name to "sqlite3.h" as part of the build process.
The makefile scans the vdbe.c source file and creates the "opcodes.h" header file that defines a number for each opcode used by the VDBE.
The malloc.h header file is needed for malloc_usable_size() function on some systems (e.g. Linux).
The mallocFailed flag of the database connection is set if a memory allocation fails.
The man page from OS X says "REG_STARTEND affects only the location of the string, not how it is matched".
The mapping from character to affinity is given by the SQLITE_AFF_ macros defined in sqliteInt.h.
The mapping must be valid for at least nAmt bytes.
The mapping size limit is used to limit the aggregate size of all memory mapped regions of the database file.
The margin length is the sum of the objects size in each dimension.
The master database table has a structure like this
The master database table is a special table that holds the names and attributes of all user tables and indices.
The master journal name must be the last thing written to a journal file.
The master journal page checksum is the sum of the bytes in the master journal name, where each byte is interpreted as a signed 8-bit integer.
The master stores, the workers read.
The master-journal page number must never be used as a pointer map page
The match must be exact.
The match succeeded, but the output vector wasn't big enough.
The matching pSrcList item
The max embedded payload fraction is the amount of the total usable space in a page that can be consumed by a single cell for standard B-tree (non-LEAFDATA) tables.

The maximum supported page-size is 65536 bytes.
The memcpy() statement assumes that the wildcard characters are the first three statements in the compareInfo structure.
The memory allocation and mutex subsystems have not necessarily been initialized when this routine is called, and so they should not be used.
The memory for a VdbeFrame object is allocated and managed by a memory cell in the parent (calling) frame.
The memory for objects of this type is always allocated by  sqlite3DbMalloc(), using the connection handle stored in VTable.db as  the first argument.
The memory for the returned string is obtained from sqlite3_malloc().
The memory is used by client code for its own purposes (for example, to store a high-level schema associated with  the shared-btree).
The memory locations
The memory management strategy depends on the value of the xDel parameter.
The memory manager table
The memory sanitizer distributed with versions of clang before 3.8 has a bug: if you call mmap before malloc, mmap may return an address that is later overwritten by the msan library.
The memory size function can always be overridden manually by defining the macro SQLITE_MALLOCSIZE to the desired function name.
The mempool allocator is activated by calling sqlite3_config().
The memsys static mutex
The merge engine to advance to the next row
The merge is an "OR" merge (see function fts3DoclistOrMerge() for details).
The meta-information in the segment directory is: level               - segment level (see below) idx                 - index within level - (level,idx uniquely identify a segment) start_block         - first leaf node leaves_end_block    - last leaf node end_block           - last block (including interior nodes) root                - contents of root node  If the root node is a leaf node, then start_block, leaves_end_block, and end_block are all 0.
The method called is identified by the second argument, "offset", which is the offset of the method to call in the sqlite3_module structure.
The method used to calculate the color difference is based on the color distance in the RGB(a) cube.
The methods above are in version 1 of the sqlite_module object.
The methods above are in version 1 of the sqlite_vfs object definition.
The methods above are in versions 1 and 2 of the sqlite_vfs object.
The methods above are in versions 1 through 3 of the sqlite_vfs object.
The methods of the json_each virtual table
The methods of the json_tree virtual table.
The middle slot is expanded to two slots in order to make space for the two elements in the FROM clause of the subquery.
The min leaf payload fraction is like the min embedded payload fraction except that it applies to leaf nodes in a LEAFDATA tree.
The minimum PMA size is set to this value multiplied by the database page size in bytes.
The minimum allocation size is capped at 2**12.
The minimum amount of free space that we have seen.
The minimum amount of initialization feasible is performed.
The minimum answer is 1.
The minimum count for any phrase so far.
The minimum is now also defined in terms of LINK_SIZE so that the use of malloc() kicks in at the same number of forward references in all cases.
The minimum number of cells allowed for a node is a third of the  maximum.
The minimum value of NN is 1 (of course).
The minimum value of dimension iDim is considered first, the maximum used to break ties.
The minor type of the error token
The mode to open the stream with
The modified database pages are written to a *-oal file.
The modifiers are as follows:  NNN days NNN hours NNN minutes NNN.NNNN seconds NNN months NNN years start of month start of year start of week start of day weekday N unixepoch localtime utc  Return 0 on success and 1 if there is any kind of error.

The mutex associated with the source database BtShared structure will always  be held when either of these functions are invoked.
The mutex associated with the specific b-tree being checkpointed is taken by this function while the checkpoint is running.
The mutex entered using the unixEnterMutex() function must be held when this function is called.
The mutex implementation does not need to make a distinction between SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE and SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST if it does not want to.
The mutex object
The mutex on database handle db should be held by the caller.
The mutex subsystem must take care of serializing its own initialization.
The mutex type
The mutex will already be held (obtained by code in malloc.c) if sqlite3GlobalConfig.bMemStat is true.
The mutexes implementation cannot be overridden at start-time.
The mutexes still do not provide any mutual exclusion.
The nDLt column is like nLt except that it contains the  number of distinct entries in the index that are less than the sample.
The nEq column is a list of integers.
The nEq, nLt, and nDLt entries of sqlite_stat3 all contain just a single integer which is the same as the first integer in the equivalent columns in sqlite_stat4.
The nExtra parameter specifies the number of bytes of space allocated along with each page reference.
The nExtraReg parameter is 0 or 1.
The nFreeSlot and pFree values do require mutex protection.
The nRef field of the vxworksFileId object is incremented before the object is returned.

The new root-page may not be allocated on a pointer-map page, or the PENDING_BYTE page.
The new rowid
The new rowid is not NULL (in this case the rowid will be automatically assigned and there is no chance of a conflict), and  the statement is either an INSERT or an UPDATE that modifies the rowid column.
The new segment id must be between 1 and 65335 inclusive, and must not be used by  any currently existing segment.

The newly created file's file descriptor is assigned to the conch file structure and finally the original conch file descriptor is  closed.
The newly created page cache
The next 2 bytes contain the number of entries currently  stored in the node.
The next 31 bits encode the key the lower 31 bits the value.
The next 5 must be kept together and in sequence so that a test that checks for any one of them can use a range.
The next SQLite to access the file will not know that the journal exists (because the directory entry for the journal was never created) and the transaction will not roll back - possibly leading to database corruption.
The next action
The next block of code attempts to adjust the packing of siblings to get a better balance.
The next block of code checks to see if the register array has changed, and if so it reinitializes the relavant parts of the sqlite3_context object
The next block of code will expand the outer query FROM clause to 4 slots.
The next call to _step() (if any) will return SQLITE_ERROR and _finalize() will return NOMEM.

The node at the root of the subtree is modified as follows:  Expr.op        Changed to TK_COLUMN Expr.pTab      Points to the Table object for X.Y Expr.iColumn   The column index in X.Y.
The node containing the cell to be read
The node data is passed to this  function via the zNode/nNode parameters.
The node from which to extract a coordinate
The node from which to extract the ID
The node into which the cell is to be written
The node may be a leaf or an internal node.
The node need not contain any terms, but the header must be written before this function is called.
The node number
The node to render
The nodeno of the root node is always 1.
The non flexible children can overflow the container, in this case we should just assume that there is no space available.
The non-greedy case could be replaced by an OP_EXACT, but it is probably not worth it.
The noopFunc macro provides this.
The normal repeating kets try the rest of the pattern or restart from the preceding bracket, in the appropriate order.
The nth character of the string indicates the column affinity that should be used for the nth field of the index key.
The nth character of the string indicates the column affinity that should be used for the nth memory cell in the range.
The number 17 is used here in order to account for the space used by the 15 character random suffix and the two trailing NUL characters.

The number returned includes any quotes used but does not include the null terminator.
The number we're after is the integer represented by those digits times 10**e
The numbers are obtained at random and have no special meaning, other than being distinct from one another.
The numbers generated here are based on typical values found in actual indices.
The numbers ran backwards (decreasing) and were counted from the Ides (15th of the month - which in the old Roman republican lunar calendar would have been the full moon) or from the Nonae (9th day before the Ides) or from the beginning of the next month.
The numeric character reference forms described above are allowed to reference any Unicode code point other than U+0000, U+000D, permanently undefined Unicode characters (noncharacters), and control characters other than space characters (U+0009, U+000A, U+000C and U+000D)
The object to be destroyed
The official C-language API documentation for SQLite is derived from comments in this file.
The offset  is the offset of the first rowid in the current doclist.
The offset data is the offset to the starting bracket from the start of the whole pattern.
The offset for ReadFile.
The offset for WriteFile.
The offset returned is to the start of the write-ahead log frame-header.
The offset will always be the same for converting to title case.
The offset_vector values are handled similarly to the normal case above.
The offsets array is on a 4-byte boundary to keep things efficient for architectures that need such a thing.
The old colset object (if any) is not freed in this case.
The old does not.
The old journal mode
The old rowid
The on-disk format is big-endian and needs to be converted for little- endian platforms.
The on-disk record stores integer coordinates if eInt is true and it stores 32-bit floating point records if eInt is false.
The onError parameter determines which (if any) of the statement and/or current transaction is rolled back.
The one bit that is set will correspond to the common table.
The one byte written is an ASCII 'S' character which also happens to be the first byte in the header of every SQLite database.
The one that was just advanced (iPrev) and the one next to it in the array.
The one-pass algorithm only works if the WHERE clause constrains the statement to update or delete a single row.
The only argument is a pointer to a function which works like malloc.
The only consequence will be disabled optimizations.
The only database page the statement reads is page 1, which is guaranteed to be in the cache.
The only declarations within blocks below are for variables that do not have to be preserved over a recursive call to RMATCH().
The only difference  is that the counter used is stored as part of each individual statement object (struct Vdbe).
The only difference being the specification of leap years.
The only difference between OP_CLASS and OP_NCLASS occurs when a data character outside the range is encountered.
The only difference between state 1 and state 2 is that if the integer encountered in state 1 is not 0 or 1, then we need to increment the column 0 "nDoc" count for this term.
The only difference will be a combined handling of them in the end.
The only differences between these routines are the text encoding expected for the second parameter (the name of the function being created) and the presence or absence of a destructor callback for the application data pointer.
The only error that can occur here is a malloc() failure.
The only exception is that an IO error may have occurred, causing an emergency rollback.
The only interesting finder-function is autolockIoFinder, which looks at the filesystem type and tries to guess the best locking strategy from that.
The only modifications are the addition of a couple of NEVER() macros to disable tests that are needed in the case of a general LALR(1) grammar but which are always false in the specific grammar used by SQLite.
The only number that _can_ be determined is the number of rows that have already been pre-fetched by the client library.
The only possible error from InitPage
The only potential use of repetition is in cases when the assertion is optional.
The only purpose is to provide an easy way to test the sqlite3AbsInt32() function.
The only qualification being that each varint must be stored contiguously.
The only read-lock obtained by a connection in read-uncommitted mode is on the sqlite_master  table, and that lock is obtained in BtreeBeginTrans().
The only real difference between fdatasync() and fsync(), Ted tells us, is that fdatasync() will not flush the inode if the mtime or owner or other inode attributes have changed.
The only reason the dbFileSize variable is required is to suppress  unnecessary calls to xTruncate() after committing a transaction.
The only reason to read this page is to obtain the page number for the next page in the overflow chain.
The only sibling page is the right-child of the parent.
The only special case when we should return -1 ourselves, because inet_addr() considers it wrong.
The only thing omitted is the automatic recompile if a  schema change has occurred.
The only thing that remains to commit the transaction is to finalize  (delete, truncate or zero the first part of) the journal file (or  delete the master journal file if specified).
The only thing the main thread can write to events is NULL, so we can just try one more time
The only thing the thread can write to commands is NULL, so we can just try one more time
The only way to find out whether SQLite automatically rolled back the transaction after an error is to use this function.
The only way to reach the limit is with sqlite3_malloc()
The only way we can do that is to re-do the match at the same point, with a flag to force SKIP with an argument to be ignored.
The opcode being coded
The opcode mnemonic, e.g. "add"
The opcode to be commented
The open cursor on the table
The open database file
The operand
The operand token for setting the span
The operands are usually destroyed by the opcode handler.
The operation to code triggers for (INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE) is given by the op parameter.
The operation will return SQLITE_LOCKED to the user because it requires a lock that will not be available until connection pBlocker concludes its current transaction.
The operator
The operator for aggregate functions is changed to TK_AGG_FUNCTION.
The optimization can be used if:  (a) the value returned by OsDeviceCharacteristics() indicates that a database page may be written atomically, and (b) the value returned by OsSectorSize() is less than or equal to the page size.
The optimization is also always enabled for temporary files.
The optimizer is able to deliver rows in group by order so we do not have to sort.
The option can be set in the regex by (*NO_START_OPT) or passed in match-time options.
The optional parameter allows the user to determine the new filename extension (default is .zip or .tar).
The optional parameter allows the user to determine the new filename extension (default is phar).
The optional paramtype acts as a hint for drivers that have alternate quoting styles.
The order in which they are updated is important, as this code needs to avoid disrupting any page from which cells may still to be read.
The order of destruction is important here.
The ordering is a comma delimited list of provider names.
The original API set ends here.
The original LIKE operator
The original SQL text is source code.
The original argv is then 'clobbered' to store the process title.
The original code caused an unsigned overflow in 64 bit systems, so now we use a conditional statement.
The original code used just to take the least significant 8 bits of octal numbers (I think this is what early Perls used to do).
The original design allowed these amounts to vary, but as of version 3.6.0, we require them to be fixed.
The original expression
The original handler needs to be restored after pclose()
The original heap-recursive code used longjmp().
The original idea for these functions came from Scott Wimer.
The original page number
The original where.c file retains the code that does query planning and analysis.
The other allowed parameters to sqlite3_mutex_alloc() each return a pointer to a static preexisting mutex.
The other bytes change randomly with each file change when a codec is in use.
The other columns should be set to the values that make up the new record  to insert.
The other one to retrieve the list of dependencies associated with an object.
The other sqlite3_backup_XXX() API functions, backup_remaining() and backup_pagecount() are not thread-safe functions.
The other statements may still be reading from the database.
The other thread can clear the list, so we know events can only be NULL until we change it.
The other thread has signaled us on this pipe and we've received the signal, now we need to read all the data so we can select on this fd again.
The other two will be 0.
The other values are only used when there exists one or more separate worker threads.
The othercase might be the same value.
The others have a common form.
The output buffer should be big enough to hold the whole output file and a NUL terminator at the end.
The output line number is small enough that we are still in the main program.
The output of the recursive-query is added back into the Queue table.
The output position list - written to *pp - is a copy of *pp2 with those entries that are not sufficiently NEAR entries in *pp1 removed.
The output stack uses the rest of htab, and contains characters.
The output struct is copied, and may be freed by the caller.
The output values are undefined in this case.
The output variable *ppExpr is populated with an allocated Fts3Expr  structure, or set to 0 if the end of the input buffer is reached.
The output vector is stored on the stack, and contains pointers to characters.
The output vector wasn't big enough
The output written into *pp contains all positions of both *pp1 and *pp2 in sorted order and with any duplicates removed.
The overall R-Tree
The overall collating sequence is BINARY If this routine returns TRUE, that means that the RHS can be substituted for the LHS anyplace else in the WHERE clause where the LHS column occurs.
The overhead of adding the "rbu" VFS to the system is negligible for  non-RBU users.
The overlying software layer calls this routine when all of the data on the given page is unused.
The overrun tests check for a slightly smaller size so that they detect the overrun before it actually does run off the end of the data block.
The p1 parameter is set to 0 for an old.rowid reference, or to (i+1) to reference another column of the old.* pseudo-table, where  i is the index of the column.
The p2 value always comes from a prior OP_CreateTable opcode and that opcode will always set the p2 value to 2 or more or else fail.
The pA side might be using TK_REGISTER.
The pAppData field of the sqlite3_vfs VFS objects are initialized to be pointers to the correct finder-function for that VFS.
The pAppData is a pointer to a pointer to the "finder" function.
The pAppData pointer is used as the only parameter to xInit and xShutdown.
The pArg from the previously registered  profile function is returned.
The pArg from the previously registered trace is returned.
The pBt is no longer on the sharing list, so we can access it without having to hold the mutex.
The pBt pointer itself may not be changed while there exists cursors  in the referenced BtShared that point back to this Btree since those cursors have to go through this Btree to find their BtShared and they often do so without holding sqlite3.mutex.
The pBuf element of the returned sqlite3_pcache_page object will be a pointer to a buffer of szPage bytes used to store the content of a  single database page.
The pBuf parameter is the initial value of a pointer which will receive the new memory.
The pCtx argument  is actually a pointer to the Pager structure.
The pCtx argument points to a UCollator structure previously allocated using ucol_open().
The pDatabase points to the table name and the pTable points to the database name.
The pDbPage reference remains valid.
The pDirtyPrev pointers are corrupted by this sort.
The pEList corresponds to the result set of a SELECT and is NULL for other statements.
The pExpr should be a TK_COLUMN expression.
The pExtra element of sqlite3_pcache_page will be a pointer to the szExtra bytes of extra storage that SQLite has requested for each entry in the page cache.
The pFirst token is the first token in the sequence of tokens that describe the type of the column currently under construction.
The pFix structure must have been initialized by a prior call to sqlite3FixInit().
The pH containing "elem"
The pH to be searched
The pMem is known to contain content that needs to be destroyed prior to a value change.
The pMem object must have been initialized.
The pNext field is the only field in the sqlite3_vfs structure that SQLite will ever modify.
The pNext field points to the NameContext in the parent query.
The pOn and pUsing parameters are the content of the ON and USING clauses.
The pOuter field of the subclauses points to the WhereClause object for the whole clause.
The pPKey2 key must be a parsed key such as obtained from sqlite3VdbeParseRecord.
The pParent field points back to the parent page.
The pPrior and regPrior parameters are used to implement a cache to avoid unnecessary register loads.
The pSpace buffer is used to store a temporary copy of the divider cell that will be inserted into pParent.
The pSpace buffer will be freed after the next call to balance_nonroot(), or just before this function returns, whichever comes first.
The pSrc corresponds to the FROM clause of a SELECT or to the table being operated on by INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE.
The pTable and pDatabase parameters are NULL for subqueries.
The pVal argument is known to be a value other than NULL.
The pWhere argument is an optional WHERE clause that restricts the set of rows in the view that are to be added to the ephemeral table.
The pX parameter is the expression on the RHS of the IN operator, which might be either a list of expressions or a subquery.
The packing above might be so out of balance as to be illegal.
The packing computed by the previous block is biased toward the siblings on the left side (siblings with smaller keys).
The padding is done by adding '0's to the left of the string that is going to be printed.
The padding is done by printing the character ch.
The padding type value
The page and offset from which the current term was read.
The page begins at offset *pOffset into the file.
The page being analyzed
The page being overwritten.
The page cache
The page cache implementation is not obligated to free any memory, but well-behaved implementations should do their best.
The page cache subsystem reads and writes a file a page at a time and provides a journal for rollback.
The page cache will allocate instances of this object.
The page data
The page data is not required.
The page footer consists of a single varint for each term located on the page.
The page handle passed as the first argument refers to a dirty page  with a page number other than iNew.
The page is always associated with the Pager object passed as the first  argument.
The page is fetched as read-write unless pCur is not NULL and is a read-only cursor.
The page is left marked dirty in this case.
The page is then marked  not dirty.
The page is written into the  main journal or sub-journal as required.
The page must be corrupt
The page number identifies the page that contains the cell with a pointer to this overflow page.
The page number identifies the parent page in the btree.
The page number of a page in journal

The page size must be a power of 2 between 512 and 65536.
The page that contains a pointer to pDbPage
The page that contains the Cell
The page that contains the cell
The page that currently resides at pgnoRoot will be moved to the allocated page (unless the allocated page happens to reside at pgnoRoot).
The page that pCur currently points to has just been modified in some way.
The page to be fetched is determined by the key.
The page to move to.
The page-mapping is an array of HASHTABLE_NPAGE (or HASHTABLE_NPAGE_ONE for the first index block) 32-bit page numbers.
The page-number  is not used in this case.
The page-number identifies the previous page in the overflow page list.
The page-number is not used in this case.
The pageDestructor() routine handles that chore.
The pager also implements file locking to prevent two processes from writing the same database file simultaneously, or one process from reading the database while another is writing.
The pager being played back
The pager cache has created a new page.
The pager calls this method to signal that it has done a rollback and that the database is therefore unchanged and it hence it is OK for the transaction change counter to be unchanged.
The pager falls back to PAGER_READER state if successful, or PAGER_ERROR state if an error occurs.
The pager filename is invariant as long as the pager is open so it is safe to access without the BtShared mutex.
The pager invokes the busy-handler if sqlite3OsLock() returns  SQLITE_BUSY when trying to upgrade from no-lock to a SHARED lock, or when trying to upgrade from a RESERVED lock to an EXCLUSIVE  lock.
The pager is always 'purgeable' (not an in-memory database).
The pager is not an in-memory pager.
The pager is used to access a database disk file.
The pager journal filename is invariant as long as the pager is open so it is safe to access without the BtShared mutex.
The pager marks the page as clean so that it does not get written to disk.
The pager must already hold the exclusive lock on the main database file before invoking this operation.
The pager must hold at least a RESERVED lock when this function is called.
The pager never allocates the pages involved in locking therefore.
The pager object
The pager open on the database file
The pager should eventually be freed by passing it to sqlite3PagerClose().
The pager state may be changed from PAGER_ERROR to PAGER_OPEN here without clearing the error code.
The pager that owns pPg
The pager this page is part of
The pager to set safety level for
The pager_playback() routine will discover that the journal file is not really hot and  will not roll it back.
The pager_truncate() call uses xFilesize() to measure the database file on disk, and then truncates it if required.
The pager_unlock() routine will be called before returning to unlock the file.
The parameter "op" must be one of TK_UNION, TK_EXCEPT, TK_INTERSECT or TK_ALL.
The parameter "x" must have been obtained from a prior call to sqlite3VdbeMakeLabel().
The parameter N is measured in bytes.
The parent already computed us a width or height.
The parent key is a composite key that includes the IPK column
The parent or outer SELECT statement
The parent page is the page that contains a pointer to the child.
The parent process has then to wait for the master process to initialize to return a consistent exit value.

The particular combination of bits in each WhereLoop help to determine the algorithm that WhereLoop represents.
The particular policies used here have proved out well in experimental comparisons, but better ones may yet be found.
The pass2 scanning routines call fill_inverse_cmap when they need to use an unfilled entry in the cache.
The passed in "connection" can be a cached stub from plist or freshly created.
The passed string obviously doesn't descend from the regular serializer.
The password first, since that is what is most unknown
The path only contained slashes

The payload for an entry and the preceding pointer are combined to form a "Cell".
The pcache.c and pager.c modules deal pointers to PgHdr objects.
The pcache1.separateCache variable is true if each PCache has its own private PGroup (mode-1).
The pcache1Fetch() wrapper invokes the appropriate routine.
The pending byte page is set assign for use by the VFS layers as space for managing file locks.
The performance of this function is not critical.
The period of this function is equal to the product of both primes.
The permutation applies to registers only.
The permutation is only valid until the next OP_Compare that has the OPFLAG_PERMUTE bit set in P5.
The phrase extracted from pExpr
The phrase iterator passed as the second argument:  features at least one token that uses an incremental doclist, and   does not contain any deferred tokens.

The pipes are only used signal the other thread that something is ready.
The point is past an end of the line segment.
The point is to increment the last character before the first wildcard.
The point lies inside the portion of the plane spanned by the line segment.
The pointer is always the first 4 bytes of the page in this case.
The pointer is overwritten with the old value.
The pointer map data
The pointer map entries for all these pages need to be changed.
The pointer map is a lookup table that identifies the parent page for each child page in the database file.
The pointer map is used to locate the parent page quickly.
The pointer map page
The pointer map page number
The pointer may subsequently be used as an argument to the function free(3).
The pointer may then be retrieved by the current or any future invocation of the same fts5 extension function made as part of of the same MATCH query using the xGetAuxdata() API.
The pointer p is currently at the last byte of the character.
The pointer points at a child  page of pPage.
The pointer points at an overflow page pointed to by one of the cells on pPage.
The pointer points at the next overflow page in the list.
The pointer returned by this routine looks directly into the cached page of the database.
The pointer returned in pzBuf must be freed via sqlite3_free().
The pointer returned is ephemeral.
The pointer to the function to invoke is passed as the fourth parameter to this procedure.
The pointer to the top of the heap.
The pool of bytes for shared locks begins at SHARED_FIRST.
The position could have changed, recalculate
The position is set by the parent, but we need to complete it with a delta composed of the margin and left/top/right/bottom
The position list belonging to document  (Fts5SegIter.iRowid).
The position list data  immediately follows the key data in memory.
The position list in this case is populated as for "A * C" before returning.
The position lists may or may not be edited if 0 is returned.
The positions numbers are not stored literally but rather as two more than the difference from the prior position, or the just the position plus 2 for the first position.
The posix advisory locking structure
The posspropstab table has four entries per row.
The post- PHP 5.3 feature for "interned" strings disallows their reallocation but (i) any IN binds either interned or not should already be null terminated and (ii) for OUT binds, php_oci_bind_out_callback() should have allocated a new string that we can modify here.
The prefix should normally always be present.
The prepared statement
The prepared statement being evaluated
The prepared statement under construction
The prepared statements need to know in advance the complete set of attached databases that will be use.
The prepared stmt under constructions
The presence of a busy handler does not guarantee that it will be invoked when there is lock contention.
The present code works in the post-conversion color space, typically RGB.
The previous line is meant for vim and emacs, so it can correctly fold and unfold functions in source code.
The previous paragraph was written in 2005.
The primary goals are portability and ease of use.
The primary key for the row to be deleted must be stored in a sequence of nPk memory cells starting at iPk.
The primary purpose of this is to allow access to the sqlite_master table even when its contents have been corrupted.
The principle used to locate the table name in the CREATE TABLE  statement is that the table name is the first non-space token that is immediately followed by a TK_LP or TK_USING token.
The principle used to locate the table name in the CREATE TRIGGER  statement is that the table name is the first token that is immediately preceded by either TK_ON or TK_DOT and immediately followed by one of TK_WHEN, TK_BEGIN or TK_FOR.
The print_lengths flag controls whether offsets and lengths of items are printed.
The print_pager_state() routine is intended to be used by the debugger only.
The probability is close to 0 in practice.
The problem has been fixed with the "v2" interface.
The problem here is that cp1252 looks like SJIS for certain chars.
The problem here is that cp1254 looks like SJIS for certain chars.
The problem in trying to be exactly like Perl is in the handling of escapes.
The problem is that in order to update a b-tree, the leaf page (at least) containing the entry being inserted or deleted must be modified.
The processing is much simpler since there is only a single row of output.
The program argument is an array of integers that defines the test.
The program counter
The program name loops through the master table and deletes every row that refers to a table of the same name as the one being dropped.
The program should be interrupted before this sleep finishes.
The progress callback
The progress callback will be invoked every nOps opcodes.
The progress handler callback must not do anything that will modify the database connection that invoked the progress handler.
The properties in each row are those that apply to the character set in question.
The proxy file - a single-byte file used for all advisory file locks normally taken on the database file.
The proxy file and the lock file are never deleted so they only need to be created the first time they are used.
The proxy lock file path for the database at dbPath is written into lPath,  which must point to valid, writable memory large enough for a maxLen length file path.
The proxy locking method is a "super-method" in the sense that it opens secondary file descriptors for the conch and lock files and it uses proxy, dot-file, AFP, and flock() locking methods on those secondary files.
The proxy locking style is intended for use with AFP filesystems.
The proxyLockingContext has the path and file structures for the remote  and local proxy files in it
The ptrmapCheckPages() contains assert() statements that verify that all pointer map pages are set correctly.
The public SQLite interface.
The public interface to sqlite3Realloc.
The purpose of such selects is to call user-defined functions that have side effects.
The purpose of the following assert() is to check that only a single call to balance_quick() is made for each call to this function.
The purpose of the pointer map is to facility moving pages from one position in the file to another as part of autovacuum.
The purpose of the wal-index is to answer this question quickly:  Given a page number P and a maximum frame index M, return the index of the  last frame in the wal before frame M for page P in the WAL, or return NULL if there are no frames for page P in the WAL prior to M.
The purpose of the wrapper is to provide the ability to simulate a malloc failure, so that the handling of an error in sqlite3_os_init() by the upper layers can be tested.
The purpose of this SHARED lock is to prevent any other client from unlinking the WAL or wal-index file.
The purpose of this is to test that the fts3_tokenizer() function can be used as designed by the C-code in the queryTokenizer and registerTokenizer() functions above.
The purpose of this limit is to prevent various integer overflows.
The purpose of this routine is to linearize, in some sense, stack addresses for alloca.
The purpose of this superclass is to define certain fields that are common to all module implementations.
The quality parameter for Wbmp stands for the threshold when called from image2wbmp()
The quality parameter for gd2 stands for chunk size
The query generator uses an array of instances of this structure to help it analyze the subexpressions of the WHERE clause.
The query is a simple term lookup that matches at most one term in the index.
The query logic likewise merges doclists so that newer data knocks out older data.
The query strategy is to look for an equality constraint on the json column.
The query under construction
The r1 and r2 member variables are only used by the optimized comparison functions vdbeRecordCompareInt() and vdbeRecordCompareString().
The rScore is the primary key.
The ram filesystem has no write behind so it is ordered
The random check-hash initializer
The random initializer is important, because garbage data that appears at the end of a journal is likely data that was once in other files that have now been deleted.
The range may have an upper bound, a lower bound, or both.
The rationale for this is that this  function is used to read database headers, and a new transient or zero sized database has a header than consists entirely of zeroes.
The raw F-S error computation can potentially compute error values of up to +- MAXJSAMPLE.
The rbu_state table is used to save the state of a partially applied update so that it can be resumed later.
The read lock is released when all cursors are closed.
The read lock on the database file is released when the last cursor is closed.
The readdirfunc declaration can't be prototyped, because it is assigned, below, to two functions which are prototyped in glob.h and dirent.h as taking pointers to differently typed opaque structures.
The reader algorithm in the previous paragraphs works correctly, but  because frames for page P can appear anywhere within the WAL, the reader has to scan the entire WAL looking for page P frames.
The reader uses this recorded "mxFrame" value for all subsequent read operations.
The real implementation of xFetch and xUnfetch
The real indices of the table are only considered if the NOT INDEXED qualifier is omitted from the FROM clause
The reason a single byte cannot be used instead of the 'shared byte range' is that some versions of windows do not support read-locks.
The reason being that it is not guaranteed that the content table actually contains the same data as the index.
The reason for doing this instead of deleting the VdbeFrame immediately is to avoid recursive calls to sqlite3VdbeMemRelease() when the memory cells belonging to the child frame are released.
The reason for using a vdbe program instead of writing code to use the b-tree layer directly is that the vdbe program will take advantage of the various transaction, locking and error handling infrastructure built into the vdbe.
The reason we now register another shutdown function is in case the user registered their own shutdown function after calling session_set_save_handler(), which expects the session still to be available.
The reasons are: 1.
The record consists of a single 32-bit configuration cookie value followed by a list of  SQLite varints.
The record created does not contain anything yet.
The record flows over onto one or more overflow pages.
The record number is not previously used as a key in the database table that cursor P1 points to.
The record to verify
The record-size field is a 2 byte varint and the record  fits entirely on the main b-tree page.
The recursive SELECT to be coded
The recursive calls normally come through sqlite3_os_init() when it invokes sqlite3_vfs_register(), but other recursive calls might also be possible.
The recursive part of a recursive CTE
The refcount is decremented in the persistent helper
The reference count is a 16-bit field, initialized to zero.
The reference count of the VTable structure associated with database  connection db is decremented immediately (which may lead to the  structure being xDisconnected and free).
The reference count on pShmNode has already been incremented under the cover of the unixEnterMutex() mutex and the pointer from the new (struct unixShm) object to the pShmNode has been set.
The reference count on pShmNode has already been incremented under the cover of the winShmEnterMutex() mutex and the pointer from the new (struct winShm) object to the pShmNode has been set.
The reference string for digits.
The refinement below will clean this approximation up.
The reg argument is the address of the first in an array of registers  that contain the values substituted for the new.* and old.* references in the trigger program.
The reg, orconf and ignoreJump parameters passed to this function are the same as those described in the header function for sqlite3CodeRowTrigger()
The regNewData parameter is the first register in a range that contains the data to be inserted or the data after the update.
The regOldData parameter is similar to regNewData except that it contains the data prior to an UPDATE rather than afterwards.
The regPrev register set holds the previously output value.
The regex below is based on a regex by Michael Rushton.
The regex is partly compiled into this space, but the compiled parts are discarded as soon as they can be, so that hopefully there will never be an overrun.
The regex might still be not perfect, but catches the most of IP variants.
The regions in the following copy operation cannot overlap.
The register P3 contains the maximum number of allowed errors.
The register allocator depends on this property.
The register or immediate operand.

The remaining available space that needs to be allocated
The remaining code is the reference MD5 code (md5c.c) from rfc1321
The remaining entries all point to query results.
The remaining entries cache the RtreeNode for the first elements of the priority queue.
The remaining opcodes are just skipped over.
The remaining space between the parent dimensions+padding and child dimensions+margin.
The remapping case could be accomplished with less memory for non- interlaced images, but interlacing causes some serious complications.
The repeating kets try the rest of the pattern or restart from the preceding bracket, in the appropriate order.
The replace() function.
The replacement string C
The reports issued by valgrind are incorrect - we would prefer that the randomness be increased by making use of the uninitialized space in zBuf - but valgrind errors tend to worry some users.
The request could not be fulfilled using a freelist slot.
The request line looks like: "GET http://foo.bar.com HTTP/1.1" That is, there is no path.

The row-trigger may have deleted the row being updated.
The rowid and root page number values are needed by the code that sqlite3EndTable will generate.
The rowid at the end of the index entry is ignored as well.
The rowid for a table is always UNIQUE and NOT NULL so whenever the rowid appears in the ORDER BY clause, the corresponding WhereLoop is automatically order-distinct.
The rowid for each segment leaf is found by passing the segment id and  the leaf page number to the FTS5_SEGMENT_ROWID macro.
The rowid searching for
The rowid should be written to *pRowid.
The rowid that might be changing
The rowid we are to seek to
The rtree may have between 1 and RTREE_MAX_DIMENSIONS dimensions.
The rule applies to a range of nRange codepoints starting at codepoint iCode.
The rule of the previous sentence ensures thta if X is the bitmask for a table T, then X-1 is the bitmask for all other tables to the left of T.
The rules for a compatible index:  The index is over the same set of columns The same DESC and ASC markings occurs on all columns The same onError processing (OE_Abort, OE_Ignore, etc) The same collating sequence on each column The index has the exact same WHERE clause
The run loop thread is responsible for running the loop and then executing the callbacks when they are triggered
The runtime signal handler will jump to this code.
The sSort.addrSortIndex variable is used to facilitate that change.
The safest way to deal with the problem is to always use this wrapper which always has the same well-defined interface.
The safety level used to be boolean and older scripts may have used numbers 0 for OFF and 1 for ON.
The same argument applies to all but the first docid read from the 'other' list.
The same call sets the master journal pointer in each individual journal.
The same callback makes sure the doclists are loaded for each phrase.
The same code works when not in UTF-8 mode and in UTF-8 mode when there is no UCP support.
The same info is provided through phpinfo()
The same locking strategy and byte ranges are used for Unix.
The same space is used in the second phase for remembering where to fill in forward references to subpatterns.
The same thing might be implemented more directly using a hand-written hash table.
The same workspace is used during the second, actual compile phase for remembering forward references to groups so that they can be filled in at the end.
The sample column is a blob which is the binary encoding of a key from the index.
The sanity checking information for the new journal format consists of a 32-bit checksum on each page of data.
The savepoint to release or rollback need not be the most recently  created savepoint.
The savepoint to rollback or release is identified by parameter  iSavepoint.
The scalar function context passed as the first argument is  loaded with an error message based on the following two args.
The scalar function takes two arguments: (1) the number of dimensions to the rtree (between 1 and 5, inclusive) and (2) a blob of data containing an r-tree node.
The scanner will be searching the WHERE clause pWC.
The schema cookie is used to determine when the schema for the database changes.
The schema for each SQL table and view is represented in memory by an instance of the following structure.
The schema has been loaded
The schema layer numbers meta values differently.
The schema of the expression
The schema version is used by SQLite each time a query is executed to ensure that the internal cache of the schema used when compiling the SQL query matches the schema of the database against which the compiled query is actually executed.
The schema-cookie is usually only manipulated internally by SQLite.
The scope is known if we're in a free function (no scope), but not if we're in a file/eval (which inherits including/eval'ing scope).
The score for a perfect match
The score for this node.
The score of the selected snippet is stored in *piScore before returning.
The script cannot reasonably know the size of the message body after compression, so it's best do disable compression altogether.
The script was updated in March 2009 to generate a new EBCDIC-compliant version.

The second parameter to the callback is an integer code that specifies what action is being authorized.
The second part of a range can be a single-character escape sequence, but not any of the other escapes.
The second pass over the image maps each input pixel to the closest output color (optionally after applying a Floyd-Steinberg dithering correction).
The second point is critical:  since both setjmp() and longjmp() are called from the same code, they are guaranteed to have compatible notions of how big a jmp_buf is, regardless of whether _BSD_SOURCE or anything else has (or has not) been defined.
The second points to a buffer containing an integer value serialized according to serial_type.
The second register in the range will contain the content of the first table column.

The sector size is the minimum write that can be performed without disturbing other bytes in the file.
The sector size will be used  to determine the size and alignment of journal header and  master journal pointers within created journal files.
The seed value does not need to contain a lot of randomness since we are not trying to do secure encryption or anything like that...
The segment is modified in place so that it contains no keys smaller than zTerm/nTerm.
The segments  to be merged are the nMin oldest segments (the ones with the smallest  values for the _segdir.idx field) in the highest level that contains  at least nMin segments.

The set of static mutexes may change from one SQLite release to the next.
The set of system calls that can be overridden varies from one VFS to another, and from one version of the same VFS to the next.
The setStrOrError() function calls sqlite3VdbeMemSetStr() to store the result as a string or blob but if the string or blob is too large, it then sets the error code to SQLITE_TOOBIG  The invokeValueDestructor(P,X) routine invokes destructor function X() on value P is not going to be used and need to be destroyed.
The setting is persistent.
The setup query
The setup-query runs once to generate an initial set of rows that go into a Queue table.
The shared cache setting effects only future calls to sqlite3_open(), sqlite3_open16(), or sqlite3_open_v2().
The shared lock and an open file descriptor are maintained until  the connection to the database is closed.
The shared memory being locked
The shared memory will be simulated with heap memory.
The shared-cache leaves the 'pending lock' state when either of the following occur:  1) The current writer (BtShared.pWriter) concludes its transaction, OR 2) The number of locks held by other connections drops to zero.
The shared-lock has just been acquired then check to see if the database has been modified.

The sign in front of the number
The signal trampoline expects the TLS slots to be zeroed.
The signature algorithm must be one of Phar::MD5, Phar::SHA1, Phar::SHA256, Phar::SHA512, or Phar::OPENSSL.
The signs of N1 and N2 are ignored.
The simple approach here would be to memset() the entire object to zero.
The simple case - no more than one database file (not counting the TEMP database) has a transaction active.
The simplest is just to forbid invalid filenames, which is done here.
The single value is an array.
The single-byte matcher isn't allowed.
The single-byte matcher means we can't proceed in UTF-8 mode.
The size chosen is a little less than a power of two.
The size in bytes of the *-oal file.

The size of an array large to enough to hold all stacks, each with N elements.
The size of file pTo may be reduced by this operation.
The size of the Bitvec object is the number of pages in the database file at the start of a transaction, and is thus usually less than a few thousand, but can be as large as 2 billion for a really big database.
The size of the bitmap is fixed when the object is created.
The size of the buffer in the first argument must be greater than or equal to the product of the second and third arguments.

The sizes of all cells that are to be freed have already been computing while deciding which cells need freeing
The sizes of the extensions sum to 272 bytes on x64 for 3.8.10, but this size can vary according to architecture, compile-time options, and SQLite library version number.
The sljit ceneric compiler.
The slot is free, let's try to take it.
The slot remains on the free-list.
The snippet() and offsets() functions both return text values.
The soft heap limit
The solution is the BtShared.pHasContent bitvec.
The solution is to add an in-memory page to the cache containing the data just read from the sub-journal.
The sorter can guarantee a stable sort when running in single-threaded mode, but not in multi-threaded mode.
The source and destination do not overlap.
The source code of the verification program is included in this package.
The source object and input buffer are made permanent so that a series of JPEG images can be read from the same file by calling jpeg_gdIOCtx_src only before the first one.
The source or pattern file
The source value(s) to append.
The space between the beginning and the first element and the space between each two elements.
The space is either allocated using sqlite3DbMallocRaw() or from within the unaligned buffer passed via the second and third arguments (presumably stack space).
The space required to store the output is therefore the sum of the sizes of the two inputs, plus enough space for exactly one of the input docids to grow.
The span to be added
The spec states that a WAP client does not need to implement ExtHeaders.
The special case
The special case 2 overflow if positive
The special operator TK_ROW means use the rowid for the first column in the FROM clause.
The specific ORDER BY term
The specific database being pragmaed
The specific row is identified by the iBlockid parameter.
The specific table containing the indexed database
The specified column name was rowid", "oid" or "_rowid_"  and there is no explicitly declared IPK column.
The speed of this approach is heavily influenced by the subbox size: too small means too much overhead, too big loses because Heckbert's criterion can't eliminate as many colormap entries.
The sqlite versions only work for ASCII characters, regardless of locale.
The sqlite.busyHandler member of the sqlite struct contains the busy callback for the database handle.
The sqlite3.pDisconnect list is accessed only as follows:  1) By this function.
The sqlite3BtreeCommitPhaseOne() routine did all the work of writing information out to disk and flushing the contents so that they are written onto the disk platter.
The sqlite3BtreeCommitPhaseOne() routine does the first phase and should be invoked prior to calling this routine.
The sqlite3DbFree() routine requires two parameters instead of the  one parameter that destructors normally want.
The sqlite3DropTriggerPtr() routine does the same job as this routine except it takes a pointer to the trigger instead of the trigger name.
The sqlite3ExprIsConstantOrFunction() is used for evaluating expressions in a CREATE TABLE statement.
The sqlite3GetBoolean() function is used by other modules but the remainder of this file is specific to PRAGMA processing.
The sqlite3KeywordCode function looks up an identifier to determine if it is a keyword.
The sqlite3OsFileControlHint() routine has no return value since the return value would be meaningless.
The sqlite3PcacheFetch() and sqlite3PcacheFetchFinish() routines are split this way for performance reasons.
The sqlite3ResultSetOfSelect() is only used n contexts where lookaside is disabled
The sqlite3ValueBytes() routine returns the number of bytes in the sqlite3_value object assuming that it uses the encoding "enc".
The sqlite3ValueFromExpr() function is capable of transforming these types of expressions into sqlite3_value objects.
The sqlite3_aggregate_count() function is deprecated.
The sqlite3_blob_close() function finalizes the vdbe program, which closes the b-tree cursor and (possibly) commits the  transaction.
The sqlite3_close() version returns SQLITE_BUSY and leaves the connection option if there are unfinalized prepared statements or unfinished sqlite3_backups.
The sqlite3_close_v2() interface is intended for use with host languages that are garbage collected, and where the order in which destructors are called is arbitrary.
The sqlite3_close_v2() version forces the connection to become a zombie if there are unclosed resources, and arranges for deallocation when the last prepare statement or sqlite3_backup closes.
The sqlite3_get_table() routine does not have access to any internal data structures of SQLite.
The sqlite3_index_info structure contains many fields that are declared "const" to prevent xBestIndex from changing them.
The sqlite3_int64 and sqlite3_uint64 are the preferred type definitions.
The sqlite3_libversion() function is provided for use in DLLs since DLL users usually do not have direct access to string constants within the DLL.
The sqlite3_log() interface is intended for use by extensions such as virtual tables, collating functions, and SQL functions.
The sqlite3_mem_methods structure is filled with the currently defined memory allocation routines.
The sqlite3_mutex.id, sqlite3_mutex.nRef, and sqlite3_mutex.owner fields are necessary under two condidtions:  (1) Debug builds and (2) using home-grown mutexes.
The sqlite3_mutex_alloc() routine allocates a new mutex and returns a pointer to it.
The sqlite3_mutex_enter() and sqlite3_mutex_try() routines attempt to enter a mutex.
The sqlite3_mutex_held() and sqlite3_mutex_notheld() routine are intended for use inside assert() statements.
The sqlite3_mutex_held() and sqlite3_mutex_notheld() routine are intended for use only inside assert() statements.
The sqlite3_mutex_leave() routine exits a mutex that was previously entered by the same thread.
The sqlite3_mutex_notheld() interface should also return 1 when given a NULL pointer.
The sqlite3_mutex_try() interface returns SQLITE_OK upon successful entry.
The sqlite3_mutex_try() routine is very rarely used, and when it is used it is merely an optimization.
The sqlite3_open_v2() interface works like sqlite3_open() except that it accepts two additional parameters for additional control over the new database connection.
The sqlite3_os_end() routine undoes the effect of sqlite3_os_init().
The sqlite3_os_init() interface is called automatically by sqlite3_initialize() and sqlite3_os_end() is called by sqlite3_shutdown().
The sqlite3_os_init() routine does operating-system specific initialization of the SQLite library.
The sqlite3_overload_function() API might construct SQL function that use this routine so that the functions will exist for name resolution but are actually overloaded by the xFindFunction method of virtual tables.
The sqlite3_pcache_methods.xInit() all is embedded in the call to sqlite3PcacheInitialize().
The sqlite3_prepare() and sqlite3_prepare_v2() interfaces use UTF-8, and sqlite3_prepare16() and sqlite3_prepare16_v2() use UTF-16.
The sqlite3_prepare_v2() and sqlite3_prepare16_v2() interfaces are recommended for all new programs.
The sqlite3_profile() function is considered experimental and is subject to change in future versions of SQLite.
The sqlite3_shutdown() interface must only be called from a single thread.
The sqlite3_status() routine needs access to this mutex.
The sqlite3_step() wrapper function might then reprepare the statement and rerun it from the beginning.
The sqlite3_strglob() interface.
The sqlite3_test_control() interface calls these routines to control the PRNG.
The sqlite3_test_control() interface can be used to move the pending byte.
The sqlite3_uri_boolean(F,P,B) routine assumes that P is a boolean parameter and returns true (1) or false (0) according to the value of P.
The sqlite3_uri_boolean(F,P,B) routine returns true (1) if the value of query parameter P is one of "yes", "true", or "on" in any case or if the value begins with a non-zero number.
The sqlite3_uri_int64(F,P,D) routine converts the value of P into a 64-bit signed integer and returns that integer, or D if P does not exist.
The sqlite3_wal_hook() callback registered by sqlite3_wal_autocheckpoint().
The sqlite_int64 and sqlite_uint64 types are supported for backwards compatibility only.
The sqlite_sequence table used by AUTOINCREMENT
The sqlite_stat1 table is always relevant.
The sqlite_stat2 entries for an index that have sampleno between 0 and 9 inclusive are samples of the left-most key value in the index taken at evenly spaced points along the index.
The sqlite_stat2 table is deprecated.
The sqlite_stat2 table is not created or used unless the SQLite version is between 3.6.18 and 3.7.8, inclusive, and unless SQLite is compiled with SQLITE_ENABLE_STAT2.
The sqlite_stat2 table is superseded by sqlite_stat3, which is only created and used by SQLite versions 3.7.9 and later and with SQLITE_ENABLE_STAT3 defined.
The sqlite_stat3.sample column contains the actual value of the left-most column instead of a blob encoding of the complete index key as is found in sqlite_stat4.sample.
The sqlite_stat4 is an enhanced version of sqlite_stat3 and is only available when compiled with SQLITE_ENABLE_STAT4 and in SQLite versions 3.8.1 and later.
The sqlite_stat4 table contains multiple entries for each index.
The sqlite_statN table does not exist.
The stack is unchanged.
The stack pointer is decreased.
The stack segment linkage control information occurs at the high-address end of a stack segment.
The stacks and their tools: 'yyss': related to states.
The stacks and their tools: `yyss': related to states.
The standard isspace() can be awkward to use safely, because although it is defined to accept an argument of type int, its behavior when passed an integer that falls outside of the range of the unsigned char type is undefined (and sometimes, "undefined" means segfault).
The start field is used to free temporary variables in case of exceptions.
The start of buffer (a/n) contains the start of a doclist.
The start of the journal file currently contains a single journal  header with the nRec field set to 0.
The start/end pattern and initial options are already set from the pre-compile phase, as is the name_entry_size field.
The starting points of the name/number translation table and of the code are passed around in the compile data block.
The stat_get() SQL function will later be used to extract relevant information for constructing the sqlite_statN tables.
The state of the parser is completely contained in an instance of the following structure
The state stack.
The state variable is passed in to allow a function like fgetss to maintain state across calls to the function.
The state-number, or reduce action in SHIFTREDUCE
The statement is compiled and executed using database connection db.
The statement returns exactly one column.
The statement to bind against
The statement transaction is never a top-level transaction.
The strategy is to minimize the amount of unused space on overflow pages while keeping the amount of local storage in between minLocal and maxLocal.
The string being accumulated
The string collected so far
The string is "OrpheanBeholderScryDoubt" on big-endian.
The string is built from string macros so that it works in UTF-8 mode on EBCDIC platforms.
The string is not copied - the pointer is stored.
The string is not necessarily zero-terminated.
The string may be treated as static by the caller.
The string may or may not be quoted.
The string passed via zFunc is used as part of the error message.
The string to compare against the glob
The string will be freed automatically when the table is deleted.
The string will be the same as the name of the error code constant.
The strings are already in the correct encoding.
The strings compare the same.
The structure is divided into two parts.
The structure is reclaimed when the number of pointers to it drops to zero.
The structure methods are expected to function as follows:  xCreate: This function is used to allocate and inititalize a tokenizer instance.
The structure record
The structures are like b+trees in layout, but are constructed from the bottom up in optimal fashion and are not updatable.
The stub *must* end with a call to __HALT_COMPILER().
The study data is put in the latter, which is pointed to by the former, which may also get additional data set later by the calling program.
The subexpression broken out
The subquery
The subquery cannot use any compound operator other than UNION ALL because all the other compound operators have an implied DISTINCT which is disallowed by restriction (4).
The subquery uses a single slot of the FROM clause of the outer query.
The subquery whose WHERE clause is to be augmented
The subsequent "OP_Destroy 5 0" would hit a free-list page.
The subsequent call to sqlite3ResolveOrderGroupBy() will convert the expression to a copy of the iCol-th result-set expression.
The subsequent elements in the array are  the values of columns in the new row.
The subterms are stored in a WhereClause structure containing within the WhereOrInfo object that is attached to the original OR clause term.
The subtransaction can be rolled back independently of the main transaction.
The subtransaction is ended automatically  if the main transaction commits or rolls back.
The subtree at iBlockid will contain all terms less than the first term encoded (or all terms if no term is encoded).
The subtree blocks are contiguous, so only the first subtree's blockid is encoded.
The subtype information can be used to pass a limited amount of context from one SQL function to another.
The success code is written into *pRc.
The suggested maximum number of in-memory pages to use for the main database table and for temporary tables.
The superclass sqlite3_pcache_page.pBuf points to the start of the database page content and sqlite3_pcache_page.pExtra points to PgHdr.
The supported encoding types are hardcoded here because we are limited to the encodings supported by expat/xmltok.
The surplus columns are part of KeyInfo.nXField and are not used for sorting or lookup or uniqueness checks.
The symbol can be either a terminal or nonterminal.
The symbolic label is really just a negative number.
The symbols being reduced.
The synchronous pragma can be set to 'off' for this file, as it is not recovered if a crash occurs anyway.
The synopsis of the meanings of the various limits is shown below.
The system call failed, and *some* SQLite error should be propagated back to the caller.
The system could just by delete the RBU update database and *-oal file and have the device download the update again and start over.
The system is said to be in a deadlocked state if connection A has registered for an unlock-notify callback on the conclusion of connection B's transaction, and connection B has itself registered for an unlock-notify callback when connection A's transaction is concluded.
The system strives to keep free space after the last cell pointer so that new cells can be easily added without having to defragment the page.
The sz argument should be the size of the largest database page (a power of two between 512 and 65536) plus some extra bytes for each page header.
The sz parameter is the number of bytes in each lookaside slot.
The szMalloc field holds the correct memory allocation size
The szPage value can be any power of 2 between 512 and 32768, inclusive.
The szSlot, nSlot, pStart, pEnd, nReserve, and isInit values are all fixed at sqlite3_initialize() time and do not require mutex protection.
The tab_prefix table is the same size and type as the codetab.
The tab_suffix table needs 2**GIFBITS characters.
The table already exists.
The table b-tree entry will be replaced by the new entry  when it is inserted.
The table being constructed
The table being dropped does not have the largest root-page number in the database.
The table being indexed
The table being inserted or updated
The table being read
The table being referenced
The table below considers a file to be ASCII if all of its characters are either ASCII printing characters (again, according to the X3.4 standard, not isascii()) or any of the following controls: bell, backspace, tab, line feed, form feed, carriage return, esc, nextline.
The table conceptually has a number of rows and columns.
The table consists of integer keys mapped to values as follows:  RBU_STATE_STAGE: May be set to integer values 1, 2, 4 or 5.
The table containing the blob
The table containing the value
The table contains key/value bindings encoded in a word.
The table cursor.
The table does not exist.
The table from which records will be deleted
The table from which rows are deleted
The table from which we should delete things
The table in the FROM clause of SELECT
The table in which we should change things
The table is not a view and the column name identified an  explicitly declared column.
The table is opened using cursor 0.
The table is truncated at OP_CALLOUT because all relevant opcodes are less than that.
The table key
The table name in  the CREATE TABLE or CREATE INDEX statement is replaced with the third argument and the result returned.
The table name in the CREATE  TRIGGER statement is replaced with the third argument and the result  returned.
The table object reference passed as the second argument to this function must represent a virtual table.

The test case is inserting 1000 rows into a table  with no indexes using a single prepared INSERT statement, bind()  and reset().
The test for this is misc/cgo/testsanitizers.
The test performed depends on the value of flags:  SQLITE_ACCESS_EXISTS: Return 1 if the file exists SQLITE_ACCESS_READWRITE: Return 1 if the file is read and writable.
The test procedures use this information to make sure that indices are working correctly.
The test procedures use this information to make sure that sorting is occurring or not occurring at appropriate times.
The test procedures use this information to make sure that the zero-blob functionality is working correctly.
The test will always be false (since this module will not return a row with a negative languageid), and so the overall query will return zero rows.
The testcase() macro is inserted to help ensure adequate test coverage in places where simple condition/decision coverage is inadequate.
The testcase() macro is only used by the amalgamation.
The testcase() macro is used to aid in coverage testing.

The transient database requires temporary disk space approximately equal to the size of the original database.
The translation is done in-place and aborted if the output overruns the input.
The translation is used in order to maximize the number of bits that will fit in a Bitmask.
The tree being checked out
The tree is modified in place.
The trick here is that any conflict on the rowid value must be detected before any  modifications are made to the database file.
The trick is to disable as much as we can without disabling too much.
The tricky bit is figuring out the pointer to return in *pzTail.

Then free resources associated  with any savepoints that are destroyed by this operation.
Then if successful also mark the local connection as being locked.
Then increment the  Pager.journalOff variable by JOURNAL_HDR_SZ so that the next  record is written to the following sector (leaving a gap in the file that will be implicitly filled in by the OS).
Then increments pEnd once more so that it points to the byte immediately following the last byte in the position-list.

This also determines whether it is a leap year.
This also ensures that if any database schemas have been modified by an uncommitted transaction they are reset.
This also happens for a repeating ket if no characters were matched in the group.

This array should  be sorted A-Z.
This assert appears to trigger spuriously on certain versions of Windows, possibly due to _beginthreadex() and/or CreateThread() not fully setting their thread ID parameter before starting the thread.
This assumes a minimum cell size of 6 bytes  (4 bytes for the cell itself plus 2 bytes for the index to the cell in the page header).
This assumption is dangerous, as if a failure occurred whilst writing to the journal file it may contain some garbage data.
This avoids having to supply alternative calls for the different cases.
This avoids security issues on shared hosts where a luser messes with the lower-level pipe settings and screws up the FastCGI service.
This avoids the need for a mutex lock and our hashtable lookup.
This avoids unnecessary evaluation of arguments past the first non-NULL argument.
This bad handling is also in mysqlnd_result.c

This callback is invoked once for each index when reading the sqlite_stat1 table.
This can and should be used while extending the module as it shows if you are at the right position.
This can be NULL to have the virtual table select the new  rowid for itself.
This can be a big performance boost.
This can be a big performance win (reduced IO and CPU) if SQLite stops calling the virtual table xNext() method before retrieving all query results (as may happen, for example, if a query has a LIMIT clause).
This can be an extra read in some situations, but hopefully it is needed in most cases.
This can be changed at run-time using a pragma.
This can be convenient, as it means that the RBU application does not need to organize removing a separate state file after the update is concluded.
This can be detected by checking the NUM for zero after having a zero returned.
This can be handled like an assertion.
This can be helpful if the pattern that follows the assertion doesn't set a different char.

This can be used, for example, in diagnostic routines to search for prepared  statements that are holding a transaction open.
This can be useful, for example, to ensure that "external content" FTS4 tables are updated before their underlying content tables.
This can happen (for example)  because the table is empty or because BtreeCursorFirst() has not been called.
This can happen if the database image was extended as part of the current transaction and then the last page in the db image moved to the free-list.
This can happen if the database is corrupt.
This can happen if the page is overfull.
This can happen under solaris when a dir does not have read permissions but *does* have execute permissions
This can happen when the symbol is popped from the stack during a reduce or during error processing or when a parser is  being destroyed before it is finished parsing.
This can help the subquery to run more efficiently.
This can occur if there exists an index on a TEMP table which has the same name as another index on a permanent index.
This can only  happen if there was no previous entry for this token.

This can only happen for stores
This can only happen with the table rooted at page 1.

This case is handled better by fast_forward_first_char.
This case is handled differently from the others.
This case is highly unlikely since we just recently freed a lot of memory.

This case should work for GCC
This case when the file is being statically linked into the  application
This case when the file really is being compiled as a loadable  extension

This cell was just inserted
This cell will replace the cell being deleted from the internal node.
This character is not found in valid UTF-8 sequences and is rarely used in popular 8-bit character encodings.
This check also serves to verify that the offset to the start of the cell-content area, according to the page header, lies within the page.
This check ensures that an EP_TokenOnly expression is never passed down into valueFromFunction().

This is helpful while  debugging.
This is here to suppress warnings from the GCC cpp's -Wunused-macros.
This is hit if -k is set or there is no match
This is how you do event::event_list in c
This is implemented by setting them to zerofirstbyte and zeroreqchar when such a repeat is encountered.
This is important  because the OpenWrite opcode below will be needing it.
This is important for SQLite because we are not able to use a "," as the decimal point in place of "." as specified by some locales.
This is important for embedded applications on platforms with limited memory.
This is important in case the transaction being rolled back has modified the database schema.
This is important, as the root merge (INCRINIT_ROOT) will be using the same task object.
This is in case the previous page written to the journal has already been synced.
This is in case the sample record is corrupted.
This is in violation of the appnote.
This is intended to be used within debuggers.

This is just an arbitrary value for the fallback case.
This is just like sqlite3ResolveExprNames() except that it works for an expression list rather than a single expression.

This is like Close() followed by Init() only much faster.
This is like SRT_Table except that this destination uses OP_OpenEphemeral to create the table first.
This is likely to be an append
This is limited to  some extent by SQLITE_MAX_SQL_LENGTH.
This is loaded last, as the TEMP database schema may contain references to objects in other databases.
This is mainly for debugging, though the function is able to force a failure.
This is more important that I originally thought.
This is more restrictive than necessary.
This is more than the usual guess of 10 rows, since we have no way of knowing how selective the index will ultimately be.
This is most useful for declaring functions that can then be called with CALL_PHPx.
This is mostly just syntactic sugar.
This is much faster than scanning the entire 10MB WAL.
This is much faster than synthesizing  a new poslist the way we have to for more complicated phrase or NEAR expressions.
This is necessary as such an INSERT does not open a statement transaction.
This is necessary as the VM code is being generated for will not open a statement transaction.
This is necessary as the memory cell array may contain pointers to VdbeFrame objects, which may in turn contain pointers to open cursors.
This is necessary for the correct constraint check processing (in sqlite3GenerateConstraintChecks()) as part of UPDATE and INSERT statements.
This is necessary if you are compiling on a recent machine (ex: Red Hat 7.2) but you want your code to work on an older machine (ex: Red Hat 6.0).
This is necessary if you are running in an EBCDIC environment, or if you want to default to a different encoding, for example ISO-8859-1.
This is necessary on Windows where the stack can only grow in 4k steps.
This is needed (for example) prior to parsing a statement since we will be comparing table and column names against all schemas and we do not want those schemas being reset out from under us.

This is no longer necessary as this function is now only called right before committing a transaction.
This is no longer permitted, on the grounds that it creates a library that is technically incompatible with an SQLite library  compiled with a different limit.
This is normally adequate protection, but it is theoretically possible, though very unlikely, that an inopertune power failure could leave the journal in a state which would cause damage to the database when it is rolled back.
This is normally the case when the "TEMP" or "TEMPORARY" keyword occurs in between CREATE and TABLE.
This is not  supported by the new syntax (it is replaced by the NOT operator).
This is not VxWorks.
This is not a malloc/realloc check.
This is not a performance issue because it happens only when there has been a compilation error.
This is not a problem, as the column type of "t1.col" is never used.
This is not a problem, because ZEND_ACC_HAS_TYPE_HINTS is never set, and we won't check arguments on internal function.
This is not a real checksum.
This is not actually a problem, but it does cause a valgrind error when the 1 or 2 bytes of unitialized  data is passed to system call write().
This is not actually counted as a transition to ERROR state in the state diagram at the top of this file, since we know that the same call to pager_unlock() will very shortly transition the pager object to the OPEN state.
This is not actually used, but is here for completeness, in case someone wants to use the HWB stuff for anything else...
This is not considered a compatibility break because any application that ever receives an SQLITE_MISUSE error is broken by definition.
This is not correct any more, depends on what compare_func is set to.
This is not feasible in DOS machines.
This is not generally possible with a WAL database, as rollback involves simply truncating the log file.

This is really OP_Noop and OP_Explain
This is really just for tidiness with callouts, in case they inspect these fields.
This is really just the default value for the max_page_count pragma.

This is required in case this connection creates the database file.
This is required in case this index is actually a  PRIMARY KEY and the table is actually a WITHOUT ROWID table.
This is required in order to estimate the cost of loading large doclists from the database.
This is safe as the entries for the new poslist are a subset of the old, so it is not possible for data yet to be read to be overwritten.
This is safe because dropping a cell only overwrites the first four bytes of it, and this function does not need the first four bytes of the divider cell.
This is safe because this thread is  currently holding locks that exclude all other readers, writers and checkpointers.
This is safe since there is always at least one byte free
This is security sensitive code.
This is set during a rollback or by user request, respectively.
This is similar in concept to how sqlite encodes "varints" but the encoding is not the same.

This is slightly inefficient, but still correct.
This is slightly tricky as the leaf node may be underfull, and the internal node may be either under or overfull.
This is slow and works badly.
This is so as to ensure that the buffer is big enough to hold the current doclist AND'd with any other doclist.
This is so both syntaxes can be tested using a single build of testfixture.
This is so that expressions in the WHERE clause (etc.) can refer to expressions by aliases in the result set.
This is so that there is a complete hash-table on each aligned 32KB page of the wal-index.
This is somewhat different than other callbacks because if the user returns 1, we will interpret that as saying that this message has no body.
This is stupid way to do.
This is sub-optimal because it means that instead of one callback with a large array of context pointers the application will receive two or more callbacks with smaller arrays of context pointers, which will reduce the applications ability to prioritize multiple  connections.
This is subsequently free'd at exit.
This is successful most of the time (about 9 times out of 10).
This is sufficient to allow us to identify EBCDIC text and to distinguish between old-style and internationalized examples of text.

This loads from a file, a stack of x509/crl/pkey sets
This locking mode is appropriate for use on read-only databases (ex: databases that are burned into CD-ROM, for example.)  It can also be used if the application employs some external mechanism to prevent simultaneous access of the same database by two or more database connections.
This logic is only to support hiding warnings that the streams layer puts out at times, but for libxml we may try to open files that don't exist, but it is not a failure in xml processing (eg.
This logic is only used for input more than STRTOD_DIGLIM digits long (default 40).
This looks ridiculous and it is - but we validate the name ourselves using the peer_name ctx option, so just use the CN from the cert here
This lookup table is used to help decode the first byte of a multi-byte UTF8 character.
This loop also drops the divider cells from the parent page.

This text is not quoted - if it is used as part of an SQL statement it needs to be quoted appropriately.
This thread is currently holding mutexes on all Btrees (because of the sqlite3BtreeEnterAll() in sqlite3LockAndPrepare()) so it is not possible for another thread to start a new schema change while this routine is running.
This thread runs independently of its creator until it is joined using sqlite3ThreadJoin(), at which point it terminates.
This time we set the flag for the keyword 'abstract'.
This time, a result of NOMATCH isn't an error.
This transformation is necessary because the multiSelectOrderBy() routine above that generates the code for a compound SELECT with an ORDER BY clause uses a merge algorithm that requires the same collating sequence on the result columns as on the ORDER BY clause.
This trick assumes that both the page-size and sector-size are an integer power of 2.
This turns on the following extra special behaviour:  3a.
This turns on the following special behaviour in the rbu VFS:  If the exclusive shm WRITER or READ0 lock cannot be obtained, the checkpoint fails with SQLITE_BUSY (normally SQLite would proceed with running a passive checkpoint instead of failing).
This turns out to be a really, really expensive thing to check, so only do this occasionally - not on every iteration.
This turns out to be rather cunning.
This turns out to be trickier than you   * might think because of the possibility of matching an empty string.

This was a premature performance optimization that isn't thread safe, if we want it thread safe we need to add mutex code...
This was easier recursively, but dangerous on long lists, so we walk it ourselves
This was either supplied by the user when the table was created, or added later to the table definition by an ALTER TABLE command.
This was the 'else' case, we can't really 'detect' it
This was the last allocation.
This was the root node.
This way we don't need to touch the build system files.
This way, SQLite uses the in-memory journal data to  roll back changes made to the internal page-cache before this function was called.
This way, even if the tokenizer does not provide synonyms when tokenizing query text (it should not - to do would be inefficient), it doesn't matter if the user queries for  'first + place' or '1st + place', as there are entires in the FTS index corresponding to both forms of the first token.
This way, it may end up in the journal file twice, but that is not a problem.
This way, php_pollfd_for will return a mask with POLLOUT if the connection is successful and with POLLPRI otherwise.
This way, the Pager.eLock variable may be set to a less exclusive (lower) value than the lock that is actually held at the system level, but it is never set to a more exclusive value.
This way, the remainder of the function does not have to deal with any overflow cells in the parent page, since if any existed they will have already been removed.
This whole area is rewritten in PCRE2 because there are some obscure cases.

This will copy also the strings and the root, which we will have to adjust in the loop
This will copy the error code and the messages, as they are buffers in the struct
This will fire the triggers and remove both the table and index b-tree entries.

Thomas in chapter III.1 of Graphics Gems II (James Arvo, ed.
Thomas points out that the distances from a given colormap entry to each cell of the histogram can be computed quickly using an incremental method: the differences between distances to adjacent cells themselves differ by a constant.
Thomas' article also describes a refined method which is asymptotically faster than the brute-force method, but it is also far more complex and cannot efficiently be applied to small subboxes.
Those  below are for version 2 and greater.
Those below are for version 3 and greater.
Those cannot be recreated afterwards.
Those keywords will cause indices to be created and the table record must come before the  indices.
Those methods that are common to all locking modes are gather together into this division.
Those operator always uses word arguments without write back.
Those operators always uses word arguments without write back.
Those that follow are added in version 2 or later
Those that follow must honor the ORDER BY clause.
Those users would then do a  Google search for "sqlite", find the telephone numbers of the developers and call to wake them up at night and complain.
Though MEM_Str and MEM_Blob values may be discarded, MEM_Int, MEM_Real, and MEM_Null values are preserved.
Though they are intended for internal use by SQLite, code that links against SQLite is permitted to use any of these routines.

Throughout a write-transaction, dbFileSize contains the size of the file on disk in pages.
Throughout the rollback process, each time a page is rolled back, the corresponding bit is set in a bitvec structure (variable pDone in the implementation below).

Thus  'a' LIKE 'A' would be true.
Thus NDEBUG becomes an opt-in rather than an opt-out feature.
Thus a value may be added and freed from multiple parents so long as a reference is added first using XMLRPC_CopyValue() SEE ALSO XMLRPC_RequestFree () XMLRPC_CreateValueEmpty () XMLRPC_CopyValue() XMLRPC_VALUE SOURCE
Thus entry 0 contains the join operator for the join between entries 0 and 1.
Thus for GROUP BY and DISTINCT the pOrderBy terms can be matched in any order.
Thus for NULL and zero-length we are quite efficient.
Thus for single-threaded operation, there is exactly one instance of this object and for multi-threaded operation there are two or more instances.
Thus it is very simple, we remove it.
Thus it won't extend and rehash the hash constantly.
Thus it's ok to return here.
Thus null data
Thus the characteristics of the randomization are the same
Thus the default max embedded payload fraction is 64.
Thus the following two ALWAYS.
Thus the not-found jump of seekOp will never be taken
Thus the process of scanning the NameContext list corresponds to searching through successively outer subqueries looking for a match.
Thus the program must guarantee that the original will not change during the lifetime of the copy.
Thus the result table has 8 entries.
Thus we can not use strlen.
Thus we can skip this part of the runtime check for non-internal functions.
Thus we check manually for _get_module.
Thus we have to follow it :(
Thus we need to do part of what it does or Zend will report leaks.
Thus we need to resend the types, if any such values occur, and force resend for the next execution.
Thus, a bit more space is pre-allocated at the end of the buffer, see php_mysqlnd_rowp_read().
Thus, a log line is always one line long
Thus, a proactive measure like this self-test is needed.
Thus, a test for both these conditions is necessary to ensure we correctly detect the start of the pattern in both phases.
Thus, any virtual table method (xFilter etc.) that may directly or indirectly call this function must call sqlite3Fts3SegmentsClose() before returning.
Thus, correcting target_len so it's suddenly don't overflown.
Thus, detecting the absence of a lookahead is sufficient to determine that there is no unexpected or expected token to report.
Thus, it is only those at the end that need unsetting here.
Thus, state merging (from LALR or IELR) and default reductions corrupt the expected token list.
Thus, the name is size - 1.
Thus, the safety measure is unlikely to cause much annoyance, and is a reasonable tradeoff to use when authenticating against existing hashes that are not reliably known to have been computed with the correct algorithm.
Thus, this "checksum" scheme, though fast and simple, catches the mostly likely kind of corruption.
Thus, this function itself never impersonates, but does use the identity of the thread.
Thus, using it as a generic allocator is not suggested.
Thus, we cannot look for specific key values if we want to build binaries that run on both systems.
Thus, we determine the type by iterating through the entire array and figuring out each element.
Thus, we do these hacks.
Thus, we need another opcode here.
Thus, we need to calculate a value, nOff, between 0 and 7, to shift  it by.
Thus, we optionally deviate from the correct algorithm just enough to avoid such collisions.
Thus, we resort to this not so clever hackery.

To achieve the same effect using this new  interface, add the DELETEONCLOSE flag to those specified above for  OpenExclusive().
To address the performance and cache coherency issues, proxy file locking changes the way database access is controlled by limiting access to a single host at a time and moving file locks off of the database file and onto a proxy file on the local file system.
To avoid a creating security problems for older applications that relink against newer versions of SQLite, the ability to run load_extension is turned off by default.
To avoid concerns about buffer overreads, this routine is only used on schemas where the maximum valid header size is 63 bytes or less.
To avoid deadlock, first release all locks with a larger BtShared address.
To avoid deadlocks and other threading problems, the sqlite3_log() routine will not use dynamically allocated memory.
To avoid deadlocks, multiple Btrees are locked in the same order by all database connections.
To avoid excess churning of page 1, the update only happens once.
To avoid losing the reference in that case we work on a copy.
To avoid problems, the necessary byte swapping is carried out using a 64-bit integer rather than a 64-bit float.
To avoid stomping the errno value on a failed read the lastErrno value is set before returning.
To avoid stomping the errno value on a failed write the lastErrno value is set before returning.
To avoid this hazard, the pager switches into the ERROR state instead of READER following such an error.
To avoid this overhead dwarfing the actual productive work accomplished, the incremental merge is only attempted if it will write at least 64 leaf blocks.
To avoid this scenario, the sqlite3_unlock_notify() performs deadlock detection.
To avoid this, make sure to also run the full LIKE on all candidate expressions by clearing the isComplete flag
To avoid this, update the wal-index header to indicate that the log file contains zero valid frames.
To avoid thwarting these optimizations, it is important not to clear the cursor here.
To be 'in range', both values need to be a power of two greater than or equal to 512 or 32, and not greater than their  respective compile time maximum limits.
To be implemented when we have more image formats.
To be order-distinct is not quite the same as being UNIQUE since a UNIQUE column or index can have multiple rows that  are NULL and NULL values are equivalent for the purpose of order-distinct.
To be order-distinct, the columns must be UNIQUE and NOT NULL.
To be safe, we will stick with the (slightly slower) fsync().
To check alignment gcc has an appropriate operator.
To clear the most recent error for sqlite handle "db", sqlite3Error should be called with err_code set to SQLITE_OK and zFormat set to NULL.
To construct the calendar for a year, you must first find the length of the year by determining the first day of the year (Tishri 1, or Rosh Ha-Shanah) and the first day of the following year.
To cope with both ways of handling this, I had resort to some messy hackery that does a test at run time.
To correct this error in the length of the year and to bring the vernal equinox back to March 21, Pope Gregory XIII issued a papal bull declaring that Thursday October 4, 1582 would be followed by Friday October 15, 1582 and that centennial years would only be a leap year if they were a multiple of 400.
To decrease the number of length checks, we try to concatenate the fixed length character sequences.
To delete, insert a NULL pointer.
To detect forward reference we have to scan up the list that is kept in the workspace.
To determine the table corresponding to the index being written, this function has to search through the database schema.
To discourage this, return a very high cost here.
To do everything in integer math, we must use integer scale factors.
To do not bloat normal filling code I added a 2nd private function.
To do so would require that samba (or whatever tool is being used for file sharing) implements locks correctly between windows and unix.
To do this in a way that is testable, mask the sign bit off of negative values, resulting in a positive value.
To do this, we maintain a count of executed SKIP_ARGs.
To downgrade to shared, simply update our internal notion of the lock state.
To encourage programmers to avoid these functions, we will not explain what they do.
To ensure that they are freed if an error occurs, link them into the Parse.pTriggerPrg  list of the top-level Parse object sooner rather than later.
To ensure unique results if UNION
To find the largest key value on pPage, first find the right-most  cell on pPage.
To force any register to be an integer, just add 0.
To force sizeof(header).
To free all resources, use sqlite3VdbeMemRelease(), which both calls this routine to invoke the destructor and deallocates Mem.zMalloc.
To fully unlock the database, delete the lock file
To get around these problems, we apply Thomas' method to compute the nearest colors for only the cells within a small subbox of the histogram.
To get stack address.
To guarantee multiple calls generate unique names even if the file is not created.
To help reduce memory requirements, sometimes an Expr object will be truncated.
To improve the visual quality of the results, we actually work in scaled RGB space, giving G distances more weight than R, and R in turn more than B.
To include callout length
To iterate through builtin functions
To iterate through levels
To look at it another way, this routine resets the state of the virtual machine from VDBE_MAGIC_RUN or VDBE_MAGIC_HALT back to VDBE_MAGIC_INIT.
To maintain a certain BC, we allow anything for the second parameter and return original string
To maintain a fully accurate histogram, we'd need to allocate a "long" (preferably unsigned long) for each cell.
To make this routine a no-op, replace it with a stub that returns SQLITE_OK but leaves pFd set to a negative number.
To many cells for a single page.
To match a '-', make it the last character in the list.
To obtain a SHARED lock, a read-lock is obtained on the 'pending byte'.
To overcome this problem, a separate data structure called the wal-index is maintained to expedite the search for frames of a particular page.
To please picky compilers
To prepend the new slots, the iStart value would be 0.
To prevent these assert()s from failing, when building with SQLITE_DEBUG defined using gcc, we force nullMem to be 8-byte aligned using the magical __attribute__((aligned(8))) macro.
To prevent these separators from being replaced with a space, we use the SKIP_LONG_HEADER_SEP to skip over them.
To prevent these separators from being replaced with a space, we use the SKIP_LONG_HEADER_SEP_MBSTRING to skip over them.
To remove all RBU extension state information, returning an RBU database  to its original contents, it is sufficient to drop all tables that begin with the prefix "rbu_"  DATABASE LOCKING  An RBU update may not be applied to a database in WAL mode.
To reset column cache
To resolve table columns references we look for nodes (or subtrees) of the  form X.Y.Z or Y.Z or just Z where  X:   The name of a database.
To run the tests, evaluate the fts3_tokenizer_internal_test() scalar function with no arguments.
To save initial string length after scanning to first variable
To save much memory, we overlay the table used by compress() with those used by decompress().
To save space on the stack and in the heap frame, I have doubled up on some of the local variables that are used only in localised parts of the code, but still need to be preserved over recursive calls of match().
To say "WhereLoop X is a proper subset of Y" means that X uses fewer WHERE clause terms than Y and that every WHERE clause term used by X is also used by Y.
To shut up GCC
To start a read transaction, the reader records the index of the last valid frame in the WAL.
To state it another way:  This routine returns a list of all triggers that fire off of pTab.
To the end of n1 and n2.
To this end, it stores xml elements, their sub-elements, and their attributes in an in-memory tree.
To tokenize an input buffer, the sqlite3_tokenizer_module.xOpen() method is called.
To update on each new cURL release using src/main.c in cURL sources
To update the set of pragmas, edit that script and rerun it.
To use SQLite in other programs, you need this file and the "sqlite3.h" header file that defines the programming interface to the SQLite library.
To verify that a date is valid, convert it to SDN and then back and compare with the original.
To work around the problem, SQLite has to manage file locks internally on its own.
To work around them, add a dummy OP_Variable here.
To work around this problem (we consider it a bug in OS X, not SQLite) we always increase the file size to 1 by writing a single byte prior to accessing the inode number.
To work around this problem, each unixInodeInfo object maintains a count of the number of pending locks on tha inode.
To work around this problem, we delay 100 milliseconds and try to delete again.
To work around this, if a call to xUnlock() fails when unlocking the database in the ERROR state, Pager.eLock is set to UNKNOWN_LOCK.
To work around this, if the journal file does appear to contain a valid header following Pager.journalOff, then write a 0x00 byte to the start of it to prevent it from being recognized.

Unfortunately it does not seem to correspond exactly to any of the five variants of EBCDIC documented in IBM's _Enterprise Systems Architecture/390: Principles of Operation_, SA22-7201-06, Seventh Edition, July, 1999, pp.
Unfortunately we cannot tell whether a name is a duplicate in the first pass, so we have to allow for more memory.
Unfortunately, PCRE requires 3 ints of working space for each captured substring, so we have to get and release working store instead of just using the POSIX structures as was done in earlier releases when PCRE needed only 2 ints.
Unfortunately, both are within their rights.
Unfortunately, doesn't behave the same way as fopen()...
Unfortunately, it is too late to change this without breaking compatibility, so we just have to live with the mistake.
Unfortunately, it needs a work array to hold the best-distance-so-far for each histogram cell (because the inner loop has to be over cells, not colormap entries).
Unfortunately, there's no clean and portable way in C to pass arguments to a variadic function if you don't know the number of arguments at compile time.

Use a rollback journal on this file
Use a slightly smaller number to allow for a few compiler-allocated temporary stack slots.
Use a testcase() macro to make sure that malloc failure within  PagerSetPagesize() is tested.
Use a tmpfile and copy the old streams contents into it
Use a value of 0 to disable any limit on the number of terms in a compount SELECT.
Use access macros to learn colors.
Use as many args as specified
Use as many entries from the input list as required and update the ppList to point to the unused elements of the list.
Use at least one from xtra.
Use at your own risk.
Use big enough power of 2
Use c to hold the length of the character in bytes, plus UTF_LENGTH to flag that it's a length rather than a small character.
Use care if you decide to try to use this routine for some other purposes.
Use class name
Use comparisons
Use covering indices for full-scans
Use custom function to get replacement string and its length.

Use iBase as the first cursor (either the *piDataCur for rowid tables or the first index for WITHOUT ROWID tables) if it is non-negative.
Use index only - omit table
Use inline code for maximizing the speed, and do the type test once at the start (i.e. keep it out of the loop).
Use libxml functions otherwise its memory deallocation is screwed up
Use mode OFF as an intermediate
Use mutex below for variable that follow.
Use native byte order

Use sqlite3EndTable() to add the view to the SQLITE_MASTER table
Use sqlite3Malloc()/memset(0) instead of  sqlite3MallocZero() to make the allocation, as sqlite3MallocZero() only zeroes the requested number of bytes whereas this module will use the actual amount of space allocated for the hash table (which may be larger than the requested amount).
Use sqlite3OsFileControl() when we are doing something that might fail and we need to know about the failures.
Use sqlite3OsFileControlHint() when simply tossing information over the wall to the VFS and we do not really care if the VFS receives and understands the information since it is only a hint and can be safely ignored.

Using our external entity loader during a RINIT should not be problem per se (though during MINIT it is, because we don't even have a resource list by then), but then whether one extension would be using the custom external entity loader or not could depend on extension loading order (if _php_libxml_per_request_initialization
Using the  built-in tokenizers, the FTS5 query 'first + place' will match instances of "first place" within the document set, but not alternative forms such as "1st place".
Using the _msize() function also requires the malloc.h header file.
Using the cache.
Using the interfaces defined in this file,  FTS5 may be extended with:  custom tokenizers, and custom auxiliary functions.
Using the values generated by patch_pc_relative_loads.
Using these size values we can go forward or backward on the block chain.
Using this cache reduces the number of calls to btreeParseCell().
Using this makes it easier to write code that can merge doclists that are sorted in either ascending or descending order.
Using this method, a query such as '1s*' will match documents that contain the literal  token "1st", but not "first" (assuming the tokenizer is not able to provide synonyms for prefixes).
Using this method, when tokenizing document text, the tokenizer provides multiple synonyms for each token.
Using zend_long would truncate a 64-bit var on Win64, so the exact long datatype fits everywhere, as long as there's no 32-bit int overflow.
Usually a single sibling on either side of the page are used in the balancing, though both siblings might come from one side if the page is the first or last child of its parent.

Usually the parent term is marked as TERM_CODED.
Usually the path zFilename should not be a relative pathname.
Usually this is encoded in the same unicode encoding as the main database (see below for exceptions).
Usually this is the size field of the position list data.
Usually used in a tight spot.
Usually, the default mutex implementations provided by SQLite are sufficient, however the application has the option of substituting a custom implementation for specialized deployments or systems for which SQLite does not provide a suitable implementation.
Usually, the sector size is less than or equal to the page size, in which case pages can be individually written.
Usually, this is 1.
Usually, this object is created and deleted automatically by RBU.

Watchpoints are either simple, recursive or implicit (PHPDBG_WATCH_* flags) Simple means that a particular watchpoint was explicitely defined Recursive watchpoints are created recursively and substitute simple watchpoints Implicit watchpoints are implicitely created on all ancestors of simple or recursive watchpoints Recursive and (simple or implicit) watchpoints are mutually exclusive  PHPDBG_G(watchpoint_tree) contains all watchpoints identified by the watch target address PHPDBG_G(watch_HashTables) contains the dtors of the HashTables to call in our custom dtor (we substitute the dtor of HashTables containing watched zvals by our own dtor) PHPDBG_G(watchpoints) contains all watchpoints (except the ones managed by watch collision) PHPDBG_G(watch_collisions) is indexed by a zend_reference * pointer.
We accumulate in a local variable to save frequent testing of lenthptr for NULL.
We added the xGetLastError() method with the intention of providing better low-level error messages when operating-system problems come up during SQLite operation.
We admit that this is a goofy design.
We aggregate the total dimensions of the container in those two variables
We allocate new temporaries for values that need to relive FAST_CALLs.
We allocate them with 2MB size granularity, to avoid many  reallocations when they are extended by small pieces
We allow very simple pattern matching for filter factories: if "convert.charset.utf-8/sjis" is requested, we search first for an exact match.
We already checked for plain function before.
We already know that pExpr is a binary operator where both operands are column references.
We also have to invert to match PNG's convention in which 255 is opaque.
We also know that the highest bit is set.
We also set ZEND_ACC_USER_ARG_INFO flag to prevent invalid usage by Reflection
We also set the "follows varying string" flag for subsequently encountered reqchars if it isn't already set and we have just passed a varying length item.
We always assume that the YYYY-MM-DD is according to the Gregorian calendar.
We always double in size
We are allocating ocaml values.
We are currently listing subprograms.
We are done.
We are finished with this character class
We are forced to roll back the active transaction.
We are not necessary in utf mode even in 8 bit mode.
We are now at the branch that is to be obeyed.
We are only ever called like this when the stream is cast to a FILE* for include (or other similar) purposes.
We are only willing to ignore this for internal functions because extensions don't always define arg_info.
We are therefore ready to move on.
We are trying for an exclusive lock but another thread in this same process is still holding a shared lock.
We are unlikely to get much useful information out of the shared heap in a core file.
We asked for one row, the next one should be EOF, eat it
We assume a 10-byte page header.
We assume any character whose value is greater than 0x80 (any UTF character) can be part of a token.
We assume that close() almost always works, since it is only in a very sick application or on a very sick platform that it might fail.
We assume that other escapes have more than one character in them, so speculatively set both class_has_8bitchar and class_one_char bigger than one.
We assume that right shift corresponds to signed division by 2 with rounding towards minus infinity.
We assume the buffer is at least ndigit long.
We assume this is a transient condition, so return WAL_RETRY.
We break it out in an effort to keep the code better organized.
We break the return address cache here, but this is a really rare case.
We build the map in a temporary bit of memory, in case the class contains fewer than two 8-bit characters because in that case the compiled code doesn't use the bit map.
We calculate argc ourselves in order to be on the safe side, even though it is also available from the symbol table.
We call AltB, AeqB, AgtB, EofA, and EofB "subroutines" but they are not actually called using Gosub and they do not Return.
We calloc, because we free().
We can "compress" the constant pool by discarding these literals.
We can also consider a regex to be anchored if OP_SOM starts all its branches.
We can compute an upper bound for the size of the result in advance and so we can prepare the buffer we pass to `sha256_crypt_r'.
We can compute an upper bound for the size of the result in advance and so we can prepare the buffer we pass to `sha512_crypt_r'.
We can easily detect direct recursion, but not mutual recursion.
We can fish out the UTF-8 setting once and for all into a BOOL, but we must not do this for other options (e.g. PCRE_EXTENDED) because they may change dynamically as we process the pattern.
We can get away with a single array (holding one row's worth of errors) by using it to store the current row's errors at pixel columns not yet processed, but the next row's errors at columns already processed.
We can get the item's length from the table, but for those that can match zero occurrences of a character, we must take special action for UTF-8 characters.
We can however report it back to PHP.
We can ignore the temporary data store on the stack from caching point of view.
We can ignore word boundary tests.
We can just ignore the repeat in JS case.
We can never assign a width smaller than the padding and borders
We can not return long strings from ICU functions, so we won't here too
We can only reach this point when reading a corrupt database file.
We can return right away for a truecolor image as deallocating colours is meaningless here
We can reuse a temporary table generated by a SELECT to our right.
We can save the cost of a memory load.
We can still let the OS do its job and be sure that each process gets the same address if desired.
We can then clear the array and begin accumulating any further context pointers without  requiring any dynamic allocation.
We can thus ignore the first parameter.
We can use true global even for ZTS because its usage is wrapped with exclusive lock anyway
We can use unsafe because we know the codepoint is in valid range and that 4 bytes is enough for any unicode point
We can't allow to set connection options for persistent connections.
We can't count on the environment variables TEMP or TMP, and so must make the Win32 API call to get the default directory for temporary files.
We can't just fail here, because of the possibility of quantifiers with zero minima.
We can't just unset them all at the start of the whole thing because they may get set in one branch that is not the final matching branch.
We can't return from hh_add until we know that hh_mem would succeed, which is to say that addr is no longer null.
We can't use zend_hash_index_find() because the array may have string keys or gaps.
We cannot allow two or more BtShared objects in the same database connection since doing so will lead to problems with locking.
We cannot be in random rowid mode if this is an AUTOINCREMENT table.
We cannot do this by looking at the value of code at the start and end of each alternative, because compiled items are discarded during the pre-compile phase so that the work space is not exceeded.
We cannot get connection as NULL or as a stub in this function.
We cannot open it, but we were able to stat it.
We cannot rely on the return value of readdir_r as it differs between various platforms (HPUX returns 0 on success whereas Solaris returns non-zero)
We cannot use TMP3 because of this allocate_stack.
We cannot use a table of offsets, because the lengths of inserts such as XSTRING(MAX_NAME_SIZE) are not known.
We cannot use the new session create logic (OCISessionGet from client-side session pool) when privileged connect or password change is attempted or OCI_CRED_EXT mode is specified.
We cannot use this for other roundtrip calls as there is no way the user can access this error
We chain together the bracket offset fields that have to be filled in later when the ends of the brackets are reached.
We change the repeat type to the non-default.
We check the name first, and then check that we have reached the end of the name in the table.
We check these after opening the stream, so that we save on fstat() syscalls
We check to see if this is a left recursion that could loop for ever, and diagnose that case.
We come here from BRAZERO with allow_zero set TRUE.
We compact the heap when it gets twice as large as its initial size.
We compile conditionally)
We compute the squared-c0-distance term, then add in the other two.
We consumed the data
We copy code into a non-register variable (tempcode) in order to be able to pass its address because some compilers complain otherwise.
We could coalesce this object into unixInodeInfo, but that would mean every open file that does not use shared memory (in other words, most open files) would have to carry around this extra information.
We could handle PHP_MODE_PROCESS_STDIN in a different manner
We could initialize it, as shown here, to silence those complaints.
We could just call the php method directly ourselves at this point, but we do this with a C callback in case the xmlrpc library ever implements some cool usage stats, or somesuch.
We could link this with -Wl,-no_pie, but it is easier to just open the binary and read it from disk.
We could not find a matching RBRACKET.
We could not restore it to the original state in case of error.
We could probably use something smarter, but this is fast enough.
We could relax this constraint somewhat by saying that the terms of the ORDER BY clause must appear as unmodified result columns in the outer query.
We could try and emulate this by casting to a FD and fstat-ing it, but since the fd might not represent the actual underlying content this would give bogus results.
We count parameters from 1
We count row_count, but will return 0
We create always persistent, as if the user want to connecto to p:somehost, we can't convert the handle then
We create an anonymous memory file, whose `handle` might be inherited by slave processes.
We currently do not have stub support for non-persistent conns.
We currently don't early-bind classes that implement interfaces
We define IPV6_RECVPKTINFO to be IPV6_PKTINFO, so assume the assume user used IPV6_RECVPKTINFO
We define class_uchardata always so that it can be passed to add_to_class() always, though it will not be used in non-UTF 8-bit cases.
We did A already case 'A': case 'a':
We do a little bit-flipping magic, repeating the MSB as the LSB, to ensure that 0 maps to 0 and 127 maps to 255.
We do a prop-set using the first dimension as the property name, all subsequent dimensions and offset as parameters, with value as the final value
We do a variant of Knuth's algorithm D (vol.
We do have to hash non-persistent connections, and reuse connections.
We do it this way so that the user's traceback function will be called by a C function with proper unwind info.
We do it this way to save on using another stack variable, as stack usage is to be discouraged.
We do not anticipate changes to experimental interfaces but reserve the right to make minor changes if experience from use "in the wild" suggest such changes are prudent.
We do not care about the actual results of the select.
We do not give errors for those.
We do not handle case conversions for the UTF character set since the tables involved are nearly as big or bigger than SQLite itself.
We do not intend to support this case.
We do not need to ping brand new connections.
We do not need to select pcre16_printint.c specially, because the COMPILE_PCREx macro will already be appropriately set.
We do not trust systems to provide a working fdatasync().
We do not use XMLWRITER_FROM_OBJECT, xmlwriter init function here
We do not use ZIP_FROM_OBJECT, zip init function here
We do not use zend_compile_binary_op for this because we want to retain the left-to-right evaluation order.
We do not want this code to appear when assert() is disabled.
We do not want to analyze these new virtual terms, so start analyzing at the end and work forward so that the added virtual terms are never processed.
We do not want to create it again.
We do nothing here, this function is needed to prevent that the fallback header handling is called.
We do the ping in php_oci_create_session, no need to ping again below
We do this as a macro so that if the SQLITE_OMIT_MEMORYDB macro is set, the value of MEMDB will be a constant and the compiler will optimize out code that would never execute.
We do this by setting the "end of previous match" offset, because that is picked up at the top of the loop as the point at which to start again.
We do this in a subroutine because the error used to occur in multiple places.
We do this in the real compile phase, not in the pre-pass, where the whole group may not be available.
We do this now since it is FAR storage and may affect the memory manager's space calculations.
We do this unconditionally so that out-of-scope pconnects are now consistent with oci_close and out-of-scope new connect semantics.
We don need to copy the data from the buffers which we will clean.
We don't actually need data yet, leave this filter in a feed me state until data is needed.
We don't handle 3.23 authentication
We don't have 'http://' so we use docref_root
We don't have control whether max_length will be used, unfortunately.
We don't have specialized opcodes for this, do nothing
We don't have to destroy all zvals if they cannot call any destructors
We don't have to free each allocated block separately, but we like to call all the destructors and callbacks in exactly the same order.
We don't have to restore the control head in case of a failed match.
We don't know how many are started and not yet finished (offset_top records the completed total) so we just have to save all the potential data.
We don't mnd_calloc()  for a reason.
We don't need no stinkin' parameters...
We don't need the workspace here.
We don't need to alloc unless we are in a meta tag
We don't need to check for buffer overflow any more.
We don't need to handle soft partial matching case.
We don't need to keep the STR_PTR, only the previous private_data_ptr.
We don't need to repeat the search if we haven't yet reached the place we found it at last time.
We don't perform any cleanup, if dirdepth is larger than 0.
We don't support _C with pdo because it uses the data in a different way - just references it.
We don't use isprint() because that can vary from system to system (even without the use of locales) and we want the output always to be the same, for testing purposes.
We don't want to do this as it leads to a memory leak when trying to delete the referenced counted node structures.
We don't want to have an arbitrary limit in the size of the password.
We don't want to leave sensitive data from our actual password hash computation on the stack or in registers.
We don't want to treat GLOB_NOMATCH as an error condition so that PHP glob() behaves the same on both types of implementations and so that 'foreach (glob() as ...' can be used for simple glob() calls without further error checking.
We dup() here to avoid messing with the passed in fd.
We duplicate the file descriptor, because fclose on a tmpfile will delete the file, but any open descriptors can still access the phantom inode.
We ended up on Saturday, but there's still work to do, so move to Sunday and continue from there.
We explicitly don't support UTF-8 delimiters for now.
We failed long ago if this is not so
We first check for the minimum number of characters.
We first get a primary token and then create a duplicate impersonation token.
We get back the length of the reference string explicitly rather than passing the address of eptr, so that eptr can be a register variable.
We get this from the beginning of htab.
We give an explicit error.
We gonna have a smaller or equally long string, estimation is almost neglecting
We got a bad exponent ('e' and maybe a sign).
We got already an error.
We got an illegal character so we are done accumulating.
We got here because we got a timeout signal, so we are in a signal handler at this point.
We got the info we needed
We got the key we wanted.
We got the time
We had 3 instrs of which the first 2 can't live in the same bundle.
We have    * compiled a pattern, and performed a single match.
We have a data character whose value is in c.
We have a fixed-length byte sequence.
We have a match.
We have advanced in ps_fetch_from_1_to_8_bytes.
We have already increased count by 1 in pgsql_stmt_fetch()
We have already reached the end of this doclist.
We have an equality constraint on the rowid.
We have asked for CURSOR but got no cursor, because the condition above is not fulfilled.
We have created a converted copy of op1.
We have flags too
We have found a candidate table and column.
We have found a character range, so single character optimizations cannot be done anymore.
We have found the first match within the subject string.
We have no native chgrp on Windows, nothing left to do if stream doesn't have own implementation
We have no native chown on Windows, nothing left to do if stream doesn't have own implementation
We have not grown past twice the size of the initial size
We have reached the end of the string.
We have successfully halted and closed the VM.
We have therefore abandoned that approach.
We have to adjust the value or repeat_max, since one less copy is required.
We have to allow for a named reference to a duplicated name (this cannot be determined until the second pass).
We have to back up and restore  EG(current_execute_data) here.
We have to back up from the allocation pointer to find the MemBlockHdr.
We have to call shutdown callback it to free TS resources
We have to do a hash_del but need to preserve the resource if there is a positive refcount.
We have to do a slow recursive search in this case, but it is an unusual case.
We have to do some funky casting in order to initialize those fields.
We have to do this instead of letting pAppData point directly at the finder-function since C90 rules prevent a void* from be cast into a function pointer.
We have to fetch all data to clean the line
We have to free the previous contents of user's bound vars
We have to initialize zBuf to prevent valgrind from reporting errors.
We have to invent our own name.
We have to keep per-table autoincrement information in case inserts are down within triggers.
We have to make it ASCIIZ temporarily
We have to push each row into a sorting index, terminate the first loop, then loop over the sorting index in order to get the output in sorted order
We have to realloc the buffer.
We have to release the mutexes on btrees that were acquired at the top.
We have to remember that there was XCLASS data, however.
We haven't enough information to catch that case precisely.
We house it in a separate routine from sqlite3_log() to avoid using stack space on small-stack systems when logging is disabled.
We ignore it.
We ignore non-ASCII first chars in 8 bit mode.
We include pcre.h before pcre_internal.h so that the PCRE library functions are declared as "import" for Windows by defining PCRE_EXP_DECL as "import".
We initialize x by assigning it a pointer to the dlsym() function.
We invoke it once here to suppress a compiler warning.
We iterate through all the arrays at once.
We iterate through the pattern, searching for the matching ending delimiter.
We just adjust the length as if we had.
We just cut a block from the end of the free block.
We just have to import the definition.
We just have to record the current subject position and start match pointer and give a MATCH return.
We just need to update that slot with all the information we've collected.
We just return the 'wrong' day of week to be consistent.
We just skip it
We just store the last char here and then pass back to the caller (sapi_cli_single_write in sapi/cli) which will actually write due to -1 return code
We keep the original size of the heap to estimate how often we should garbage collect.
We know ALT_SIGN_EXT is set if it is an SLJIT_INT_OP on 64 bit systems.
We know at this place that *p is no delimiter, so skip it
We know nothing about other code points, because we have no tables.
We know that STR_PTR was stored on the top of the stack.
We know that the regSampleRowid row exists because it was read by the previous loop.
We know that there is at least one byte left in the subject.
We know that we have a mysqli object, so this failure should be emitted
We know there is enough place on the stack.
We layout non flexible children.
We make a simple difference and add the needed elements
We make it a bit less than INT_MAX to allow for adding in group terminating bytes, so that we don't have to check them every time.
We make sure "nnn" is not too be to avoid a denial of service attack when the SQL statement comes from an external source.
We matched something in the file, so this might* be an ELF file, and the file is at least 5 bytes long, so if it's an ELF file it has at least one byte past the ELF magic number - try extracting information from the ELF headers that cannot easily * be extracted with rules in the magic file.
We may call a private function if: 1.
We may eventually want to use this information, but def it out for now
We may have half-cooked connections to clean up
We may have the last reference, then call zval_ptr_dtor() or we may leak memory.
We might as well use the "version()" function as a substitute.
We might decide to remove the regex at all though and let the server side to handle it.
We must adjust codelink so that the value of ecode+codelink is unchanged.
We must do a complete scan of the entire table.
We must not advance Generator if we yield from a Generator being currently run
We must not delete any items in EG(zend_contants)
We must not request TSRM before being booted
We must re-initialize function again
We must try the original host and port information.
We must use set() here and *not* setn(), otherwise the static string pointed to by userdata_key will be mapped to a different location when the DSO is reloaded and the pointers won't match, causing get() to return NULL when we expected it to return non-NULL.
We mustn't change the current values of the data slot, because they may be set from a previous iteration of this group, and be referred to by a reference inside the group.
We need 4 characters
We need a : prefix to resolve a name to a parameter number
We need a dummy sqlite3Apis pointer for that code if regular extension loading is not available.
We need a loop in order to check for more white space and more comments after a comment.
We need an extra instruction in any case.
We need both SetEnvironmentVariable and _putenv here as some dependency lib could use either way to read the environment.
We need only a few extra variables to hold the errors immediately around the current column.
We need some execute_data placeholder in stacktrace to be replaced by the real stack trace when needed
We need the child table as a SrcList for sqlite3WhereBegin()
We need the conn because we are doing lazy zval initialization in buffered_fetch_row
We need the length of the year to figure this out, so find Tishri 1 of the next year.
We need the length of the year to figure this out, so find Tishri 1 of this year.
We need the orinal image with each safe neoghb.
We need to advance the start offset, and continue.
We need to allocate more memory
We need to check both the hash and the address of the data.
We need to check for finiteness, because INF, -INF and NAN must not have a decimal point added.
We need to copy the data from the buffers which we will clean.
We need to define _XOPEN_SOURCE as follows in order to enable recursive mutexes on most Unix systems and fchmod() on OpenBSD.
We need to detect this invalid data (with high probability) and ignore it.
We need to do slightly different things based on client/server method so lets remember which method was selected
We need to do so explicitly for 10.2 and earlier.
We need to do this after normalisation otherwise we can't get "24H"
We need to do this before the check for active SQL statements below, as the v-table implementation may be storing some prepared statements internally.
We need to figure out the left/right padding lengths.
We need to finalize an internal statement
We need to find their position.
We need to fixup the parameter numbers on the parameters.
We need to iterate through the pattern, searching for the ending delimiter, but skipping the backslashed delimiters.
We need to know how many there are in order to distribute the space.
We need to manually convert to a pg native boolean value
We need to preserve the counter.
We need to release the end pointer to perform the backtrack for the zero-length iteration.
We need to rollback the statement transaction, if there is one, or the complete transaction if there is no statement transaction.
We need to set this because the user might not call use_result() or store_result() and we should be able to scrap the data on the line, if he just decides to close the statement.
We need to store the 'pos' since we'll modify it in the functions we're going to call and which do not support 'pos' as parameter.
We need to use TMP_REG3.
We nevertheless save it in a field for returning via the pcre_fullinfo() function so that if it becomes variable in the future, we don't have to change that code.
We now have ecode pointing to the condition or callout.
We now know closest, but first try to allocate exact
We now know the quotient digit.
We now use tmp_rsa_cb to generate a key of appropriate size whenever necessary
We only allow comparing string to prevent unexpected results.
We only care about the file size, not the other file attributes, so as far as SQLite is concerned, an fdatasync() is always adequate.
We only care about the first newline character.
We only distinguish the MS extensions to ISO-8859-1.
We only do this check while compiling, or if any of the magic files were not compiled.
We only have types for characters less than 256.
We only know the exact method that is being called if it is either private or final.
We only need to continue for OP_CBRA (normal capturing bracket) and OP_BRA (normal non-capturing bracket) because the other variants of these opcodes are all concerned with unlimited repeated groups, which of course are not of fixed length.
We only need to generate a select expression if there is a limit/offset term to enforce.
We only need to give a dimension for the text if we haven't got any for it computed yet.
We only remove the hash entry.
We only require IEEE, IBM, or VAX double-precision arithmetic (not IEEE double-extended).
We only run if there's a width or height defined
We only search for a middle character if there is no range check.
We only set dataOnly if the file size is  unchanged since the file size is part of the inode.
We only unroll the first 1-, 2-, and 3- byte cases.
We only want positive step values.
We only want to know if the last command was successful.
We optimize the result set, so we don't convert all the data from raw buffer format to zval arrays during store.
We overwrite the high bits of source.
We pass this on to our PHP listeners, if any
We point D at C and try to atomically set events to point at D if and only if events still points at C.
We prefers register and simple consts.
We prepare a DACL (Discretionary Access Control List) so that we, the creator, are allowed all access, while "Everyone Else" is only allowed to read and write to the pipe.
We put the version info first, so future versions can easily change header info.
We re-read metadata for PS
We re-use the histogram space as an "inverse color map", essentially a cache for the results of nearest-color searches.
We realloc the non-arena memory.
We really can't afford the risk of producing incompatible hashes e.g. when there's something like gcc bug 26587 again, whereas an application or library integrating this code might not also integrate our external tests or it might not run them after every build.
We recommend keeping 6 bits for G and 5 each for R and B.
We remove common factors of powers of 2 from relevant quantities.
We remove rsrc_dtor because we want the enclosing stream to be deleted from the resource list
We replace the
We reset the empty-input-file flag for each image, but we don't clear the input buffer.
We return ZEND_INTERNAL_FUNCTION, but arg_info representation is the same as for ZEND_USER_FUNCTION (uses zend_string* instead of char*).
We revisit it when we process the corresponding TERM_VIRTUAL term
We save the position of DO_FCALL for convenience in find_live_range().
We say the WhereLoop is "one-row" if it generates no more than one row of output.
We say the WhereLoop is "order-distinct" if the set of columns from that WhereLoop that are in the ORDER BY clause are different for every row of the WhereLoop.
We scale relevant quantities using O(log2(k)) rather than O(k) multiplications.
We scan the pattern to check that they are fixed length, and set their lengths.
We see the next array, so we update the sort flags of the previous array and reset the sort flags.
We set headers_sent to 1 here to avoid an infinite loop in case of an error situation.
We set its representation in the length/buffer, and then handle it as a data character.
We set the "hit end" flag if the pointer is at the end of the subject and also past the start of the subject (i.e. something has been matched).
We set the variable find_all to a non-zero value * if the -g option is present.
We should already hold a lock on the database connection
We should always be able to reacquire the read lock
We should be safely able to assume the HashTable to be consistent (inconsistent HashTables should have been caught by phpdbg_watch_efree()
We should be using "void *" but there are still machines that don't understand it.
We should check properly.
We should go back because later in this function there will be an advancement.
We should keep an reference to return_value to prevent it from being dtor in case nesting calls to unserialize
We should look and see if we can fix that somehow
We should never get here.
We should never write to the journal file the page that contains the database locks.
We should restore the flags before the label, since other taken jumps has their own flags as well.
We should still be on the same signal stack.
We shouldn't have unconstructed objects in the first place
We skip the mutex on reading because (1) most platforms read a 32-bit integer atomically and (2) even if an incorrect value is read, no great harm is done since this is really just an optimization.
We still need to check to make sure the same column is used on all terms.
We store the result in the private property string so we can access the result in uncaught exception handlers without memleaks.
We support that for legacy.
We take the approach of translating immediately before every use of yytoken.
We then add that zval to the array.
We think we might have a free slot, try to atomically grab it.
We track intermediate lock states in the sqlite3_file structure, but all locks SHARED or above are really EXCLUSIVE locks and exclude all other processes from access the file.
We try EPSV first, needed for IPv6 and works on some IPv4 servers
We try to avoid this by setting our own value first
We try to call __sleep() method on object.
We turn this off in php_execute_script()
We unset it here so as to allow assertions later in the group to be quantified.
We use a chained sequence of blocks that actually live on the stack.
We use a do-while loop so that we write at least 1 digit
We use a local variable that is preserved over calls to match() to remember this case.
We use a small timeout which should encourage the OS to send the data, but at the same time avoid hanging indefinitely.
We use an approach that tries to minimize side-channel leaks of password information - that is, we mostly use fixed-cost bitwise operations instead of branches or table lookups.
We use justifyContent to figure out how to allocate the remaining space available
We use non-nested macros with expansion, as VC has problems
We use select rather than sleep because in older versions of glibc the sleep function does some signal fiddling to handle SIGCHLD.
We use the Indirection-following version of the API since we want to clone as much as possible
We use the OP_Sort opcode instead of OP_Rewind to do the rewinding so that the global variable will be incremented and regression tests can determine whether or not the optimizer is correctly optimizing out sorts.

Whenever the first page of a main database file is read or  written, the value of the change-counter cookie is stored in rbu_file.iCookie.
Whenever this column is read, the rowid will be substituted in its place.

Whether "past" means "less than" or "greater than" depends on whether this is an ASC or DESC iterator.
Whether machine is little endian
Whether or not a match is found, SQLITE_OK is returned if no error occurs.
Whether or not a new page may be allocated by this function depends on the value of the createFlag argument.
Whether or not paBlob is NULL, *pnBlob is set to the size of the blob in bytes before returning.
Whether or not the file does end up memory mapped of course depends on the specific VFS implementation.
Whether or not the journal file is opened by this function, the Pager.pInJournal bitvec structure is allocated.
Whether the function call succeeded or failed, set the output parameters to whatever their local counterparts contain.
Whether this speeds things up or slows things down depends on the machine and the number being converted.
Whether to preserve keys while copying to the new array or not
Whether to quote additional delim char
Whether to return non-matching entries
Which action to take is determined by the overrideError parameter.
Which can mean that fillInCell() only initializes the first 2 or 3 bytes of pTmpSpace, but that the first 4 bytes are copied from it into a database page.

Whichever it was, this module duplicates the  limitation.
Whichever key is smaller, the aTree element is set to the index of it.
While a SrcList can in general represent multiple tables and subqueries (as in the FROM clause of a SELECT statement) in this case it contains the name of a single table, as one might find in an INSERT, DELETE, or UPDATE statement.
While an RBU handle is open, a SHARED lock may be held on the target database file.
While basic arithmetic operators always produce numeric string errors, bitwise operators don't produce errors if both operands are strings
While doing so, set nWork.
While it is not likely in practical situations to have strings longer than INT32_MAX, these are different types and need to be handled carefully.
While parsing a CREATE TABLE or CREATE INDEX statement in order to generate VDBE code (as opposed to parsing one read from an sqlite_master table as part of parsing an existing database schema), transient instances of this structure may be created.
While the pager remains in the ERROR state, all major API calls on the Pager will immediately return Pager.errCode.
While the xInstCount/xInst APIs are more convenient to use, this API may be faster under some circumstances.
While there is nothing to prevent an application from calling sqlite3_log(), doing so is considered bad form.
While this is technically valid in an email address, these parts aren't actually part of the address itself.
While this module could theoretically support it, sqlite3RowSetNext() is never called after sqlite3RowSetText() for the same RowSet.
While this other process is holding the file open, we will be unable to delete it.
While this sounds somewhat
While we would have liked to simply fix the bug and move on, we have to provide a backwards compatibility feature (essentially the bug) for some systems and a safety measure for some others.
White space is ignored
Whitespace never causes a state transition and is always ignored.

Win32 select() will only work with sockets, so we roll our own implementation here.
WinCE has no concept of a relative pathname, or so I am told.
WinCE lacks native support for file locking so we have to fake it with some code of our own.
WinRT has no way to convert a relative path to an absolute one.

With -O2, this jumps to 6.6 percent.
With BTREE_INTKEY, the table key is a 64-bit integer and arbitrary data is stored in the leaves.
With DEBUG enabled, some asserts below will ensure that the byte order of floating point values is correct.
With GROUP BY and DISTINCT the only requirement is that equivalent rows appear immediately adjacent to one another.
With IEEE arithmetic, ties are broken by the IEEE round-even rule.
With ORDER BY, the  pOrderBy terms must be matched in strict left-to-right order.
With SQLITE_ACCESS_EXISTS, the xAccess method simply checks whether the file exists.
With SQLITE_ACCESS_READ, the xAccess method checks whether the file is readable.
With SQLITE_ACCESS_READWRITE, the xAccess method checks whether the named directory is both readable and writable (in other words, if files can be added, removed, and renamed within the directory).
With SQLITE_TEST_REALLOC_STRESS grow the op array by the minimum* amount required until the size reaches 512.
With a covering index, the original table never needs to be accessed.
With a style, so they won't overprint each other.
With blending turned off, the browser or viewer will composite against its preferred background, or, if it does not support an alpha channel, we will see the original colors for the pixels that ought to be transparent or semitransparent.
With dotfile locking, we really only support state (4): EXCLUSIVE.
With the "v2" prepare interfaces, the underlying reason for the error is returned immediately.
With the PECL OCI 1.3.x extensions, we release pconnections when oci_close takes the refcount to zero.
With the addition of multiple database support, the following structure can also be used to describe a particular table such as the table that is modified by an INSERT, DELETE, or UPDATE statement.
With the flag set, NULL and false should be returned, respectively.
With the main loop
With the other traits, we are more permissive.
With this option, sqlite3VtabSync() is defined to be simply  SQLITE_OK so p is not used.
With this routine, there is no guarantee that results will be stored in target.
With write back, we can create some sophisticated loads, but it is hard to decide whether we should convert downward (0s) or upward (1s).
Within EofA and EofB, and EOF on entry or following nextX causes a jump to the end of the select processing.
Within the  WHERE constraint, it searches for the following:  1.
Within the ORDER BY, either:  5.
Within the RBU_STAGE_OAL stage, each call to sqlite3rbu_step() performs one of the following operations.
Within this division (the proxying locking implementation) the procedures above this point are all utilities.
Within this loop, variable eState may be set to 0, 1 or 2, depending on the parsing context.
Without a decimal point, PHP treats a number literal as an int.
Without an ORDER BY, the Queue table is just a FIFO.
Without considering pTerm, it is estimated  that the scan will visit nNew rows.
Without such a constraint, the table cannot operate.
Without the funny casting for sizeof, a Windows compiler gave this error: "unary minus operator applied to unsigned type, result still unsigned".
Without the mutexes, it is not safe to use SQLite concurrently from more than one thread.
Without this call, pixels in the foreground color are copied literally, *including* the alpha channel value, resulting in an output image which is potentially not opaque.
Without truecolor this results in far too many color indexes.

Yes, there is a color map
Yes, this is fairly wasteful at first glance, but considering that the alternative is to store what's sent into setSubstChars() and the fact that this is an extremely unlikely codepath I'd rather take the CPU hit here, than waste time storing a value I'm unlikely to use.
Yet another problem:  LinuxThreads do not play well with posix locks.
Yet, the previous php_rand only returns 31 at most.

You MUST NOT use this function for any other weird games, or call it at any other time after the object is constructed.
You are always considered to have a copy of TIFF6.0 and EXIF2.10 standard.
You are responsible for making sure that it is not linked into the TSRM hash, and not marked as the current interpreter
You are strongly advised *not* to deploy with SQLITE_NO_SYNC enabled, however, since with SQLITE_NO_SYNC enabled, an OS crash or power failure will likely corrupt the database file.
You can also insert new BTree entries or retrieve the key or data from the entry that the cursor is currently pointing to.
You can not trust the state of target if this function returns failure.
You can only stretch if the dimension has not already been defined previously.
You can pass a non-zero value as second argument to force the embedded PHP engine to re-initialise.
You can specify a range like 'a..z', it needs to be incrementing.
You can use php_stream_memory_open to create a readonly stream from an existing memory buffer.
You cannot change create_object
You cannot change from static to non static and vice versa.
You have to take care and efree() the buffer on your own.
You may assume non null *mod_data created by PS_OPEN_FUNC() is passed to PS_*_FUNC().
You must go straight to locking level 0.
You must start a transaction  before starting a subtransaction.
You never want to go smaller than padding
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program.
You will lose timing support for many of the debugging and testing utilities, but it should at least compile and run.
You will notice that the lengths alternate between 30 and 31 days, except for three anomalies: both July and August have 31 days, both December and January have 31, and February is less than 30.

db info arguments
db:    Pointer to a database connection.
dbFileSize is not used when rolling back a transaction.
dbHintSize  The dbHintSize variable is used to limit the number of calls made to the VFS xFileControl(FCNTL_SIZE_HINT) method.
dbHintSize is set to a copy of the dbSize variable when a write-transaction is opened (at the same time as dbFileSize and dbOrigSize).
dbName is the database name (ex: "main" or "temp") which will receive the imposter.
dbOrigSize is a copy of the dbSize variable at the start of the transaction.
dbPath is a string buffer at least MAXPATHLEN+1 characters in size.
dbSize before the current transaction
dbSize is set based on the size of the database file, which may be  larger than the size of the database (the value stored at offset 28 of the database header by the btree).
dbSize, dbOrigSize, dbFileSize  Variable dbSize is set to the number of pages in the database file.

for our return value, we are interested in the number of bytes consumed from the first filter in the chain

for performance reasons the code is duplicated, so that the if (include_new_line) will not need to be done for every single line in the file.
for php_dirname()
for php_memnstr, used by php_stream_get_record()
for php_raw_url_decode()
for php_set_sock_blocking() :-(
for pointers to histogram cells
for private and protected we need to unmangle the names
for read-mode only
for recursive call
for resulting hash we'll assign new hash keys rather then reordering

for the sake of BC to old damaged code
for these types, an empty string can be handled like a NULL value
for this perpouse we allocate additional PHP_IMAP_ADDRESS_SIZE_BUF bytes by default this buffer is 10 bytes long
for urls like "phar://alias/oops" it instead sets ext_len to -1 and returns FAILURE, which tells the calling function to use "alias" as the phar alias  the last parameter should be set to tell the thing to assume that filename is the full path, and only to check the extension rules, not to iterate.

gd 1.2 is copyright 1994, 1995, Quest Protein Database Center, Cold Spring Harbor Labs.
gd 2.0.11: gdSeek returns TRUE on success, not 0.
gd 2.0.2: watch out for negative indexes (thanks to David Marwood).
gd 2.02: whoops, was - b (thanks to David Marwood)
gd 2.0: true color images can use freetype too

i.e. Check session data if new sid exists already.
i.e. It deletes all of Set-Cookie headers.
i.e. PS(id), PS(session_status), PS(mod) and any other PS() values.
i.e. decrement the relevant FK counter for each row of the current table with non-NULL keys.
i.e. if a full-text index node is 900 bytes in size, then a buffer of 920 bytes is allocated for it.
i.e. if deleting the document with docid pRowid would mean the FTS3 table were empty.
i.e. if the character is a lower-case ASCII character.
i.e. if the following were coded:  OP_Destroy 4 0 ...
i.e. if the parser sees:  ATTACH DATABASE abc AS def  it treats the two expressions as literal strings 'abc' and 'def' instead of looking for columns of the same name.
i.e. if there are no active savepoints and no other statement-transactions open, iStatement is 1.
i.e. put everything back the way we found it.
i.e. the database has been reorganized so that only the first *pnTrunc pages are in use.
i.e. when the *pp1 token appears before the *pp2 token, but not more than nToken slots before it.

iAbsLevel is an absolute level that may be assumed to exist within the database.
iColumn matches a term of the ORDER BY clause
iCur is the index of a cursor open on the pTab table and pointing to the entry that needs indexing.
iDataCur is an open cursor on the btree that is the canonical data store for the table.
iDataCur is the cursor for the main table when inserting or updating a rowid table, or the cursor for the PRIMARY KEY index when operating on a WITHOUT ROWID table.
iFirstRowid, iLastRowid: These variables are only used for FTS5_PLAN_MATCH cursors.
iIdxCur is always set if to a positive value if ONEPASS is possible
iIdxCur should be used to compute the appropriate cursor depending on which index is used.
iLeafOffset: Byte offset within the current leaf that is the first byte of the  position list data (one byte passed the position-list size field).
iLeafPgno: Current leaf page number within segment.
iLevel value for root of the tree
iLimit and iOffset  are the integer memory register numbers for counters used to compute  the limit and offset.
iLimit and iOffset should have been preset to appropriate default values (zero) prior to calling this routine.
iMaster is 0 if there is not master chunk.
iMaster is the index of the master chunk.
iOff: Set to the current offset within record pData.
iPrevTrunk is initially 1.
iReg is a temp register that needs to be freed
iRowidOff: Offset of last rowid written to data area.
iRowidOffset/nRowidOffset/aRowidOffset: These are used if the FTS5_SEGITER_REVERSE flag is set.
iSpecial: If this is a 'special' query (refer to function fts5SpecialMatch()),  then this variable contains the result of the query.
iSrcLine is the source code line (from the __LINE__ macro) that generated the VDBE instruction.
iStart is zero based.
iTab is a sorting index that holds previously seen combinations of the N values.
iTable is the page number of the root of the table.
iTermIdx: Index of current term on iTermLeafPgno.
iTermLeafOffset may be equal to szLeaf if the term is the last thing on the page - i.e. the first rowid is on the following page.
iTermLeafPgno, iTermLeafOffset: Leaf page number containing the last term read from the segment.

if i is odd
if instantiating a remote object, either directly, or via a moniker, fill in the relevant info
if it doesn't fit in a long send it as a string.
if it doesn't, open a new pgsql link, add it to the resource list, and add a pointer to it with hashed_details as the key.
if it exists, it should point us to the right offset where the actual pgsql link sits.
if it is 0, no modifieres has been changed
if it is a column containing "long" data, perform late binding now
if it is a space, check if it is at the line boundary, copy and insert a break, or just keep track of it
if it is already byref, "move" it into the vargs array, otherwise make vargs a reference to this value
if it is already set, skip this
if it is inside the docroot, we scan the tree up to the docroot to find more user.ini, if not we only scan the current path.
if it is there, and if the haystack is ascii, we are all done
if it isn't there the we are done
if it starts with file:// interpreted as path to key file 4.
if it starts with file:// then it will be interpreted as the path to that cert .
if it's a child, stop here without creating the next event this event is reserved to the master process
if it's a response, we append "Response".
if it's a shadow - go to access it's private
if it's allowed, then the autoloader will be called if the class does not exist.
if it's been killed because of dynamic process management don't restart it automaticaly
if it's changed into a warning
if just checking, say yes we can be a FILE*, but don't actually create it yet
if left is 0 then there is nothing more to send, but if the last packet was exactly with the size MYSQLND_MAX_PACKET_SIZE we need to send additional packet, which has empty payload.
if main entry matches, print it...
if memRootPage is not negative, it means that the index is newly created.
if multiple encodings specified, detect automagically
if name is an absolute filename then test directly
if needle was ascii too, we are all done, otherwise we need to try using Unicode to see what we get
if new_type set resets some bits from old_type set We have completely recalculate types of some dependent SSA variables (this may occurs mainly because of incremental inter-precudure type inference)
if new_value is string "NULL" and field has default value, remove element to use default value
if no children, then must be a scalar value.
if no script_encoding specified, just leave alone
if non zero missing dirs will be created
if non-existent field
if non-null, this is the path to a temporary file that is to be deleted when the stream is closed
if none available it's simply forgotton
if not __APPLE__
if not already most-recently-used
if not and the object implements Countable we call its count() method
if not background
if not long we're operating on lzval
if not valid serialized data, it is a regular string
if not, it's certainly not an HTTP over fcgi request
if opened for append, we need to revise our idea of the initial file position
if our parent node, by definition a vector, is not an array, then our element name must be our key identifier.
if pLimit is null, pOffset will always be null as well.
if param_type is PDO_PARAM_ZVAL the driver has to provide correct data
if parts of the stream can't be written, purge it completely
if phar_get_or_create_entry_data returns a sub-directory, we have to free it
if php dies (no chance to run RSHUTDOWN) during execution it has no chance to DEALLOCATE the prepared statements it has created.
if requested, return an unmolested (magic removed) copy of the value
if save path is an empty string, determine the temporary dir
if securityPrefs is set to NONE, we don't have to do any checks, but otherwise...
if signature matched, no need to check CRC32 for each file
if so, check to see if it is a directory and fail if so if not, check to see if its dirname() exists (i.e. "/path/to") and is a directory succeed if we are creating the file, otherwise fail.
if socket was created from a stream, give the stream a chance to take care of the operation itself, thereby allowing it to update its internal state
if something found
if subject is an array
if subject is not an array
if that failed, assumed that the GUID is actually a CLSID and attempt to get the library via an instance of that class
if that fails, and this is a lock file (not-conch), try creating the parent directories and then try again.
if that fails, try to open the file read-only otherwise return BUSY (if lock file) or CANTOPEN for the conch file
if the *-wal file does not exist, set the output parameter to non-zero (to tell SQLite that it does exist) anyway.
if the alias is stored we enforce it (implicit overrides explicit)
if the caller asked for a persistent stream but the wrapper did not return one, force an error here
if the caller put us in the middle of a grapheme, we can't detect it in all cases since we can't back up.
if the conch has data compare the contents
if the conch isn't writable and doesn't match, we can't take it
if the content length is zero.
if the current word puts us over the linelength, copy back up until the last space, insert a break, and move up the laststart
if the dll wasn't loaded - exit.
if the file doesn't exist, try to extract PATH_INFO out of it by stat'ing back through the '/' this fixes url's like /info.php/test
if the given filename is an EGD socket, don't write anything back to it
if the global prefix is not set
if the host id matches and the lock path already exists in the conch we'll try to use the path there, if we can't open that path, we'll  retry with a new auto-generated path
if the needle was ascii too, we are done
if the offset of the resulting string exceeds the length, then restore the state
if the opened path is set, copy it out
if the original value is 0 (disabled), then allow setting/unsetting at will.
if the param is NULL, then we assume that they wanted to bind a lob locator into it from the query
if the pointers match then only subtract the length of the path
if the query isn't supported by the protocol, fallback to emulation
if the script we've got is stored in SHM
if the socket is in non-blocking mode and there's no data to read, don't output any error, as this is a normal situation, and not an error
if the status code did not change, we do not want to change the status line, and no need to change the code
if the stream doesn't directly support stat-ing, return with failure.
if the stream is a stdio stream let's give it a chance to respond first, to avoid doubling up the layers of stdio with an fopencookie
if the stream was wrapped, allow the wrapper to stat it
if the string is all ASCII up to size+1 - or str_len whichever is first - then we are done.
if the type is however not long, then we will do a goto in the next switch.
if the user has configured who they are, send a From: line
if the user has configured who they are, send that as the password
if the user stream was registered as local and we are in include context, we add allow_url_include restrictions to allow_url_fopen ones
if the value's type is known...
if the value's type is not known...
if the wp prefix is not set
if there are different types
if there is at least on idle child, it will handle the connection, stop here
if there is data in the buffer, it's not EOF
if there is no path name after the file, do not bother
if there was an error in the fetch then don't cache
if there wasn't a hash collision, and this doesn't
if there's no ob active, ob has been stopped
if there's no sa_len, assume the ifr_addr field is a sockaddr
if this code fails to work, check main/streams/streams.c, _php_stream_stat_path
if this was byref, update the zval
if turned on - check the compiled script ADLER32 checksum
if we already have a lock, it is exclusive.
if we are applying case conversions on column names, do so now
if we are beyond our limit, then the loop is done
if we are cutting, and we've accumulated enough characters, and we haven't see a space for this line, copy and insert a break.
if we are making a request, we want to use the methodname as is.
if we are not initializing, build the sqlite_master entry
if we are releasing the stream only (and preserving the underlying handle), we need to do things a little differently.
if we assign referenced variable, we should separate it
if we couldn't destruct cleanly, mark all objects as destructed anyway
if we did not manage to read the seed file, we should not write a low-entropy seed file back
if we don't have a user defined error handler
if we don't stop an array/iterator yield from, the exception will only reach the generator after the values were all iterated over
if we failed to get the lock then someone else must have it
if we filled their buffer, return
if we get here, we can be sure that we have enough bytes to copy safely
if we get here, we don't have a numeric string
if we have __call and method which is not part of the class function table is called, we cal __call handler.
if we have __set and property that is not part of the properties array is set, we call __set handler.
if we have called include in the frame above - this is the file we have included.
if we just compared std.properties, don't do it again
if we make it to this point, we must provide a value for the parameter
if we neither have an explicit nor an implicit alias, we use the filename
if we read any data...
if we still have memory then format the origin
if we stripped out all the '/' and still didn't find a valid path...
if we succeeded in taking the reserved lock, unlock it to restore the original state
if we talk to an old ftpd-ssl
if we want to call 16 bit regs AX,BX,CX,...
if we're setting ourselves to ourselves...
if we're started on command line, check to see if we are being started as an 'external' fastcgi server by accepting a bindpath parameter.
if you pass a listen port, we will read and write on listen port
if you prepare and then execute passing an array of params keyed by names, then this will trigger, and we don't want that
if you want to remove following line,  you should check in parse and compile time.

it is sometimes activated temporarily while debugging code responsible  for setting pointer-map entries.
it is used to get the fetch type of the HashTable (depending on whether it is empty or not) holds a HashTable for implicit watchpoints ...

sqlite3_status() needs it.
sqlite3_step() has another row ready
sqlite3_step() has finished executing
sqlite3_step() is called again to retrieve the next row of data.
sqlite3_step() should not be called again on the VM.

sqlite3_vfs methods ****************************  This division contains the implementation of methods on the sqlite3_vfs object.
sqlite3_vsnprintf() is the varargs version.
sqlite3_vtab* handles can not be shared between  database connections, even when the rest of the in-memory database  schema is shared, as the implementation often stores the database connection handle passed to it via the xConnect() or xCreate() method during initialization internally.

these variables are true statics/globals, and have to be mutex'ed on every access
they both have to be long's
they even allow mixed.
they gave us a string, but LOBs are represented as streams in PDO
they passed in a string
this "PARAMS" concept is silly.
this IS_FALSE actually means it's a BOOL type
this a jis kanji char
this algo is the only one known to me that works well on all systems
this allows support for RecursiveDirectoryIterator of subdirectories
this archive has no open references, so emit an E_STRICT and remove it
this assignment must happen before any return with failure because the caller relies on it always being made (so it can just destroy the object to close the transliterator)
this block is nothing but NOP now
this block will not be used, delete all constants there
this can actually happen if you use debug_backtrace() in your error_handler and you're in the top-scope
this can happen if you use a connection pooling software line pgpool which doesn't close the db-connection once php disconnects.
this can happen with rewrite rules - and we have no idea what to do then, so return

this constructor shouldn't be called as it's private
this could be problematic - alias should never be different from manifest alias for cached phars
this file is not in the current directory, use the original path
this file is not in the phar, use the original path
this fp is in use by a phar_entry_data returned by phar_get_entry_data, it will be closed when the phar_entry_data is phar_entry_delref'ed
this function does no rollback on error
this function doesn't check for too many parameters
this function is called asynchronously by the Interbase client library.
this function is itchin for a re-write
this function is recursive, thus the value and all of its children (if any) will be duplicated.
this function loads the collector dll (BistroJavaCollector) and the relevant functions.
this global stores the global cached pre-parsed manifests
this happens for a comment or white-space
this is a 'long column' read the column in 255 byte blocks until the end of the column is reached, reassembling those blocks in order into the output buffer this loop has to work whether or not SQLGetData() provides the total column length.
this is a convenience function for fetching a particular element from a (possibly multi-dimensional) safe array
this is a new phar that has perhaps had an alias/metadata set, but has never been flushed
this is a poor fit, but it's all we have
this is a small sample script to use libmbfl.
this is a url like "phar://blah.phar" with no directory
this is already an interned string
this is an array whose size_is(dimensions)
this is bad
this is by default
this is defined in zlib's zconf.h
this is either a brand new phar or a default stub overwrite
this is exactly what we requested
this is fine by us
this is for sure not allowed
this is host:port pair
this is implicitly required
this is long, cast to unsigned int
this is much more efficient with C99 snprintfs...
this is necessary to make it able to work with default array properties, returned to user
this is needed because on WIN32 lock is not decreased unless ZCG(counted) is set
this is not a constructor call
this is not a leave, so skip it
this is not an error here
this is not an error, we're returning NULL here
this is not good enough - seek succeeds even on truncated tars
this is not really an error, so it is allowed.
this is now the new location of the file contents within this fp
this is now the original code by Michael G Schwern: i've changed it just a slightly bit (use emalloc, get rid of includes etc) - thies - 13.09.1999
this is orphaned metadata, erase it
this is padding to get CreateInstance into the correct position
this is passed down as we recurse, so our children have access to the info.
this is port
this is read-only
this is read-only, so it's ok
this is so callers can decide if they should free the X509
this is specific to PM_STYLE_ONDEMAND
this is the case where we have less data than planned
this is the child process
this is the first execute
this is to add backwards compatibility
this is to allow a different env var to be configured in case some server does something different than above
this is too tricky to try to handle, so divide and conquer:
this is used for creating images in main memory
this is where the match starts
this is where the match starts as size_t
this link doesn't have a default transaction
this live range already removed
this long winded copy allows compatibility with older PHP versions
this looks nasty to me
this may not be safe to do, but could work and be useful
this means string, not array
this mode only use cageFS, does not use suEXEC
this must be forced
this must never happen
this object should not be pre-initialised at compile time, as the order of members may vary
this only looks like magic, it isn't
this order must match the conversion table below
this setting may be not accurate
this short-circuits us out of the recursion.
this should NOT be done in php_rshutdown_session_globals()
this should be a thumbnail IFD
this should be compatible with the standard zenderror
this should modify object only if it's empty
this should never happened (just to suppress compiler warning)
this should not happen ever
this should probably moved to a new `timelib_time *timelime_time_clone(timelib_time *)`
this state is used after a 'Connection: close' message the parser will error out if it reads another message
this sucks for threaded environments
this timeout is used by standard stream funcs, therefor it should use the default value
this used to be "metachar.h"
this used to be "metaphone.h"

this will happen once per process, and will un-globalize mem_write_lock
this will have changed for all files that have either changed compression or been modified

we also support IPV6_TCLASS, but that can be handled by the default integer optval handling in the caller
we always consume all the data passed to us.
we are adding a reference to the underlying php_curl resource, so we need to add one to the resource's refcount in order to ensure it doesn't get destroyed when the underlying curl easy handle goes out of scope.

we are checking for existence of a file within the relative path.
we are completely hosed now

we are in include_once or FastCGI request
we are in the global section
we are leaving group now: that means we cannot find the key
we are not interested in gc and flags
we are persistent and if this is a real pconn used by mysql/mysqli, then the context would not survive cleaning of EG(regular_list), where it is registered, as a resource.
we are pretending it came from the environment
we are running as cgi or fastcgi
we are running from shell and got filename was there 2.
we are still using a memory based backing.
we assume that LOBs are binary and don't need charset conversion
we assume that any glob pattern will match files from one directory only so checking the dirname of the first match should be sufficient
we botched the k estimate
we can achieve this without allocating more memory
we can avoid the key_type check here, because we tested it in the other loop
we can be modified and already be compressed, such as when chmod() is executed
we can change the type so long as nothing is currently stored.
we can create an io context
we can fill as many others as we wish.)

we can't do a ZEND_VERIFY_RESOURCE(what), otherwise we end up with a leak if we have an invalid filehandle.
we can't immediately free them in zend_generator_close() else yield from won't be able to fetch it
we cannot substitute constants here or it will break ReflectionParameter::getDefaultValueConstantName() and ReflectionParameter::isDefaultValueConstant()
we cannot use strlcpy - here the problem is that we have to copy NUL chars up to byte_count, we also have to add a single NUL character to force end of string.
we checked that it will fit:
we convert numbers to integers and treat them as a string
we copy original hostname for further processing
we correct SCRIPT_NAME now in case we don't have PATH_INFO
we could also reopen the file in "rb" mode but there is no need for that
we could create a second info struct here (end_info), but it's only useful if we want to keep pre- and post-IDAT chunk info separated (mainly for PNG-aware image editors and converters)
we could do a binary search but it's not worth it since we have at most two entries...
we could have it if we want it
we could use sizeof(stage3_table_be_apos_00000) as well
we couldn't create the proxy lock file with the old lock file path so try again via auto-naming
we deny permission to open it
we did not find an entity for this char.
we did not process messages (timed out)
we didn't find it in the hash.
we differ here with the TCL implementation in allowing for
we do have getter - fail and let it try again with usual get/set
we do not know the order of sections
we do not ping non-persistent connections
we do not want to process defaultEncoding's here
we do our own reading directly from the phar, don't change the next line
we don't care about the first
we don't care about the server's credentials
we don't care if the function name is longer, in fact lowercasing only the beginning of the name speeds up the check process
we don't handle this well for now.
we don't have complete unicode mappings for these yet in entity_decode, and we opt to pass through the octet sequences for these in htmlentities instead of converting to an int and then converting back.
we don't know the socket until we have determined if we are binding or connecting
we don't need external character sets, all character sets are compiled in.
we don't need run-time check
we don't need that
we don't support 64-bit offsets
we don't support JIS X0213
we don't use strtol because we don't want to allow negative values
we don't want headers to be sent
we don't want resource id 0
we don't want resource type 0
we don't want to count the null byte.
we don't work with *stream but need its value for comparison
we either have a query that returned a result set or an error occurred lets see if we have access to a result set
we end up here if none of the switch cases handled the field
we expect at least one parameter in varargs
we first rewind
we force PHP_STREAM_CALL_DTOR because that's from where the enclosing stream can free this stream.
we forked/spawned and this is the parent
we found another match put a newline and '-' to do some simple formatting
we get here when the last filter in the chain has data to pass on.
we got a persistent guy from our cache
we got objid array
we got our dispatchable object
we got position already from last fetch
we have 5 32-bit items plus 1 byte at least
we have a docref for a function AND - we show errors in html mode AND - the user wants to see the links
we have a non-valid entry...
we have desired string in buffer, just use it
we have everything we need in psal, flush peername and fill it properly
we have no blacklist to talk about
we have no mappings outside the BMP
we have to free SG(request_info).path_translated here because php_destroy_request_info assumes that it will get freed when the include_names hash is emptied, but we're not adding it in this case
we have to initialize the rest to get the updated max length
we have to initialized the rest to get the updated max length
we have to iterate through the set of code points for this encoding and map them to unicode code points

we haven't created a lazy object yet
we haven't initialized our ctx yet, oh well
we interpret 0x5C as the Yen symbol.

we look for directory separator from the end of string, thus hopefuly reducing our work load
we might still be _FP but we need fsize() work
we must first to copy all classes and then prepare functions, since functions may try to bind classes - which depend on pre-bind class entries existent in the class table
we must have at the very least phar://alias.phar/
we must have at the very least phar://alias.phar/internalfile.php

we need this since some servers refuse to accept SIZE command in ASCII mode
we need to "flush" the stream to save the newly deleted file on disk

we only take string arguments
we output 'no input file' now.
we pass additional args to the respective handler

we should introduce something like PARAM_PASSTHRU...
we should never have mapping in persistent encoder
we should print if no more data to come
we should print if no more space in the buffer

we want to serve more requests if this is fastcgi so cleanup and continue, request shutdown is handled later
we we're looking for a private prop
we we're looking for a private prop but found a non private one of the same name
we we're looking for a private prop but found a private one of the same name but another class
we were opened as a plain file descriptor, so we need fdopen now
we will collect all possible key lengths
we will fail, badly.
we work backwards so that we can use atoi more easily
we would result in an instable executor otherwise
we'll flush them at the end
we'll let any ol element with children through
we'll let it go this time
we'll need to  reestablish the shared lock if we can't get the  afpUnlock
we'll only need this when we have persistent statements, if ever
we'll recompress
we'll use a siginfo handler
we're about to hit image data, or are at EOF.

we're going to insert a NULL column
we're here courtesy of longjmp
we're no longer executing anything
we're not going to free these
we're okay to be zero based here
we're only interested in parameters for prepared SQL right now
we've found an extension that ends at a directory separator
we've found this file, don't re-check include_path or run realpath

we've got at least 1 byte to read less than 1 is an error AND read bytes match written
we've got at least 1 byte to read.
we've reached here - the phar exists and is a regular phar
we've started allocating resources, goto from now on
web server need set this
weighted value
when PCRE_UCP is set.
when a HashTable is freed, we can safely assume the other zvals all were dtor'ed
when a filter needs feeding, there is no brig_out to deal with.
when in read only mode try to use existing .lck file first
when not in read mode or failed to open .lck file read only.
when num_commands is 0, then realloc will be effectively a malloc call, internally
when php is started by mod_fastcgi, no regular environment is provided to PHP.
when reading file, it must exist
when reading the whole file, check for CRC errors
when removing this a lot of handlers need to be redone
when we handle prop put and get, this will look nicer
when we hit an existing break, copy to new buffer, and fix up laststart and lastspace
when we request only the header, don't fail even on error codes
when writing file (but not appending), it must NOT exist, unless a context option exists which allows it

zBase: An initial buffer.
zContentExprlist:  pzErrmsg: This exists in order to allow the fts5_index.c module to return a  decent error message if it encounters a file-format version it does not understand.
zFilename encoded in UTF-8 instead of UTF-16
zFilename is a temporary or immutable file
zFilename is the name of the database file.
zIn is a UTF-16 encoded unicode string at least nChar characters long.
zMaster may be NULL, which is interpreted as no master journal (a single database transaction).
zMaster must point to a buffer of at least nMaster bytes allocated by the caller.
zMaster points to the name of a master journal file that should be written into the individual journal file, or is NULL, indicating no master journal file  (single database transaction).
zMaster points to the name of a master journal file that should be written into the individual journal file.
zMasterName is the name of the master table.
zMasterSchema and zInitScript are set to point at the master schema and initialisation script appropriate for the database being initialized.
zName is the "A"
zName must be a pointer to a nul terminated string.
zNum is a 19-digit numbers.
zNum is empty or contains non-numeric text or is longer than 19 digits (thus guaranteeing that it is too large)
zNum must be decimal.
zOut is at least big enough to hold nIn bytes.
zOut is guaranteed to point to a buffer of at least (DEVSYM_MAX_PATHNAME+1) bytes.
zOut points to a buffer of at least sqlite3_vfs.mxPathname bytes  (in this case, MAX_PATHNAME bytes).

zend_alloc allocates memory from OS by CHUNKs, these CHUNKs and huge memory blocks are always aligned to CHUNK boundary.
zend_alloc is designed to be a modern CPU cache friendly memory manager for PHP.
zend_alloc provides familiar emalloc/efree/erealloc API, but in addition it provides specialized and optimized routines to allocate blocks of predefined sizes (e.g. emalloc_2(), emallc_4(), ..., emalloc_large(), etc) The library uses C preprocessor tricks that substitute calls to emalloc() with more specialized routines when the requested size is known.
zend_alter_ini_entry() is called for each entry.
zend_call_function may change args to IS_REF
zend_compile() replacement
zend_error() does not return in this case
zend_file_handle_dtor() operates on the copy, so we have to NULLify the original here
zend_hash_quick_update does not check, as add_assoc_zval_ex do, whether the index is a numeric and convert it to it.
zend_hash_quick_update needs length + trailing zero
zend_long alligment
zend_object_store_set_object: It is ONLY valid to call this function from within the constructor of an overloaded object.
zend_resolve_path() replacement for PHP 5.3 and above
zend_stack_push returns stack level
zend_str_tolower_copy won't necessarily set the zero byte
zend_stream_open_function() replacement for PHP 5.3 and above
